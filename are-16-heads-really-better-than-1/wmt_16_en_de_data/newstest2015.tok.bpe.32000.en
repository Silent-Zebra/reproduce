Rec@@ on@@ nec@@ ting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men Kei@@ th El@@ li@@ son and John Le@@ wis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right .
&quot; As go unions , so go mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class jobs , &quot; says El@@ li@@ son , the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota Democ@@ rat who serves as a Con@@ gres@@ sional Pro@@ gressive C@@ auc@@ us co-@@ chair .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m proud to introduce the Emp@@ loy@@ ee Em@@ power@@ ment Act with civil rights icon John Le@@ wis .
This ground@@ -@@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - st@@ opping anti-@@ union forces in their tracks
Am@@ ending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for eng@@ aging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compens@@ atory and p@@ uni@@ tive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards .
Indeed , the best way to understand what El@@ li@@ son , Le@@ wis and the co@@ spons@@ ors of their legislation are proposing is as a re@@ connection with a very American idea .
Despite the batter@@ ing that unions have taken in recent years - in Wis@@ cons@@ in , Mich@@ ig@@ an and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embra@@ ce , extend and respect labor rights .
There was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country champ@@ i@@ oned democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same bre@@ ath .
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Dou@@ glas Mac@@ Ar@@ thur and his ai@@ des encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that H@@ ide@@ ki To@@ jo &apos;s milit@@ ari@@ zed auto@@ c@@ racy would be replaced with democracy .
Ful@@ ly aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that &quot; the right of workers to organize and to bar@@ gain and act coll@@ ectively is guaranteed . &quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General D@@ wi@@ ght David Eis@@ enh@@ ower and his ai@@ des urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Ad@@ olf Hitler &apos;s fasc@@ ism was replaced with mus@@ cular democracy .
Rec@@ ogni@@ zing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : &quot; The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession .
Agre@@ ements that restrict or seek to im@@ pair this right shall be n@@ ull and void ; measures directed to this end shall be un@@ lawful .
When former First Lady Ele@@ an@@ or R@@ oo@@ sev@@ elt ch@@ ai@@ red the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global co@@ ven@@ ant , R@@ oo@@ sev@@ elt and the dra@@ f@@ ters included a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . &quot;
For generations , Americans accepted the basic premis@@ e that labor rights are human rights .
When this country coun@@ sel@@ ed other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bar@@ gaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected .
Now , with those rights under ass@@ ault in America , it is wise , indeed , to recomm@@ it to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society .
As the Re@@ ver@@ end Martin Lu@@ ther King J@@ r. said fif@@ ty years ago :
History is a great teacher .
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not dimin@@ ish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
By raising the living standards of millions , labor mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously created a market for industry and li@@ fted the whole nation to und@@ re@@ amed of levels of production .
Those who attack labor forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history rem@@ embers them .
History rem@@ embers , as should we .
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights prot@@ ections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long over@@ due .
Kei@@ th El@@ li@@ son and John Le@@ wis are rene@@ wing ide@@ als that have histor@@ ically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
Ju@@ dge temporarily blocks law that could close all Lou@@ isi@@ ana abortion clin@@ ics
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Lou@@ isi@@ ana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clin@@ ics in the state .
The measure , signed into law by Lou@@ isi@@ ana Govern@@ or Bob@@ by J@@ ind@@ al in June and due to take effect S@@ ept . 1 , would require doctors who perform abor@@ tions to have patient ad@@ mitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
However , the judge &apos;s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abor@@ tions while seeking such privileges .
&quot; Pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs will be allowed to operate law@@ fully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , &quot; Federal Ju@@ dge John de@@ Gra@@ v@@ elles wrote in the decision .
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
Ab@@ or@@ tion rights activists appl@@ au@@ ded the decision , the latest in a string of rul@@ ings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges .
&quot; Today &apos;s ruling ensures Lou@@ isi@@ ana women are safe from an under@@ handed law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , &quot; said N@@ ancy Nor@@ th@@ up , president and chief executive of the Center for Re@@ productive Rights , which su@@ ed to block the law on behalf of three of the state &apos;s five clin@@ ics .
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clin@@ ics who were not pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs in the suit and have also applied for ad@@ mitting privileges .
Lou@@ isi@@ ana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling un@@ constitutional such measures in Al@@ ab@@ ama and Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i .
Key parts of a Texas law that would have sh@@ ut@@ tered most remaining clin@@ ics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday .
Ab@@ or@@ tion rights campaign@@ ers , along with the American College of Obst@@ etri@@ cians and Gy@@ nec@@ ologists and the American Medical Association , say ad@@ mitting privileges laws impose medi@@ cally unnecessary requirements on doctors .
Anti-@@ abortion advocates have counter@@ ed that the measures aim to protect women &apos;s health , though some have also lau@@ ded their effect of sh@@ ut@@ tering clin@@ ics .
Only one doctor who perform@@ s abor@@ tions in Lou@@ isi@@ ana has hospital ad@@ mitting privileges , the Center for Re@@ productive Rights said .
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abor@@ tions , that doctor , fear@@ ful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
In argu@@ ing against the ruling , Lou@@ isi@@ ana officials said they would not pun@@ ish doctors performing abor@@ tions while their applications for ad@@ mitting privileges were pending .
Del@@ ayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean o@@ vari@@ an cancer k@@ ills more in rural areas
Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of O@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2007 .
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from o@@ vari@@ an cancer than their city counter@@ parts .
Res@@ ear@@ chers analy@@ sed medical records of more than 1@@ 100 Australian women diagno@@ sed with o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis .
Le@@ ad resear@@ cher Sus@@ an Jordan , of the Q@@ IM@@ R Ber@@ gh@@ of@@ er Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
SM@@ ALL ST@@ U@@ D@@ Y : New drugs may slow lung , o@@ vari@@ an cancer
The researchers tra@@ cked the women &apos;s medical jour@@ neys across seven years .
Dr Jordan said a woman &apos;s age at the time of diagnosis , o@@ vari@@ an cancer type , having existing ill@@ nesses and socio-economic status also imp@@ acted on survival chances .
Ol@@ der women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates .
Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors .
&quot; This disease is best treated by g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological on@@ c@@ ology sur@@ ge@@ ons and they &apos;re mostly based in major cities , &quot; she said .
Despite improving tel@@ e-@@ medicine services to l@@ essen the ty@@ ran@@ ny of distance , she suggested more fl@@ y-@@ in , fl@@ y-@@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with o@@ vari@@ an cancer was poor , rein@@ forcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
The research , funded by the Rio T@@ into Ri@@ de to Con@@ quer cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia .
In March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast m@@ um E@@ lish@@ a Ne@@ ave was told that she had an aggressive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
Garden centres rue fall in home@@ owners
The drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of home@@ owners aged under 35 , could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of po@@ unds a year when today &apos;s young consumers reach the &quot; core gar@@ dening age group , &quot; according to the HT@@ A &apos;s study , which was reported by the Financial Times .
According to the report , people r@@ enting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens .
It c@@ ited the rise in people living in highly urban@@ ised areas with no gardens , the popularity of p@@ aving over front gardens for parking and shr@@ in@@ king garden size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
Gre@@ ater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain &apos;s lowest spend per household on gar@@ dening products .
The HT@@ A and Royal Hor@@ ticul@@ tural Society said that r@@ enting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
Gu@@ y Bar@@ ter , chief hor@@ ticul@@ tural advis@@ er to the R@@ HS , said : &quot; Contain@@ er gar@@ dening , for example , is especially popular with rent@@ ers who can move their plants when they reloc@@ ate . &quot;
The HT@@ A report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector &apos;s &apos; golden age &quot; as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-@@ 1990s .
It also predic@@ ted an improved market this year due to better weather following un@@ favourable conditions in March and April last year .
In Pakistan , the protest movement led by political oppon@@ ent , Im@@ ran Kh@@ an , and the spiritual leader , Ta@@ hi@@ ru@@ l Q@@ ad@@ ri , continues .
In the capital city of Islam@@ ab@@ ad , around 1000 demonstr@@ ators stor@@ med the govern@@ ment-@@ run television station , P@@ TV .
However , information minister , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hi@@ d , said that soldiers had been able to force the protes@@ ters back out of the building .
The TV station stopped broadcasting for approximately 40 minutes , but has since begun to broadcast again .
At the same time , around 3000 demonstr@@ ators attempted to reach the official resi@@ dency of Prime Minister Na@@ wa@@ z Sh@@ ari@@ f .
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately one kilomet@@ re away , they c@@ las@@ hed with security security services , armed with sti@@ cks and stones .
The police used te@@ ar gas .
The demonstr@@ ators demanded Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s resign@@ ation , which he refused .
The Pakistan Army called for a political solution to the conflict &quot; without delay and without res@@ or@@ ting to violence . &quot;
Following a meeting at its headquarters on Sunday evening , the military announced : &quot; The Army remains committed to its task of ensuring security for the State &quot; .
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has taken power by force several times in the past .
The opposition politi@@ cian , Im@@ ran Kh@@ an , acc@@ uses Prime Minister Sh@@ ari@@ f of rig@@ ging the parliamentary elections , which took place in May last year .
The protests escal@@ ated at the weekend , after Kh@@ an and Q@@ ad@@ ri called on their fol@@ lo@@ wers to advance to Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
There were three people killed .
Turkey Sum@@ mon@@ s US Diplom@@ at Over Sp@@ ying Report
The Turkish foreign mini@@ stry has sum@@ mon@@ ed the most senior U.S. diplom@@ at in the country for clarification of a report about American and British sp@@ ying in Turkey .
Dep@@ uty Prime Minister Bul@@ ent said the U.S. charge d &apos;@@ aff@@ aires and Turkish officials had discussed the report Monday .
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Inter@@ c@@ ept said that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analy@@ st Ed@@ ward Snow@@ den show that Turkey was a high priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services .
According to Turkish news wir@@ es , Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ i@@ p Erdo@@ gan down@@ played the importance of the report , saying that all major countries spi@@ ed on each other .
An earlier report that Germany &apos;s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara drew a more an@@ gr@@ y response from the Turkish government .

Mag@@ alu@@ f police chief charged over corruption
The claim@@ ants presented proof of ext@@ or@@ tion by polic@@ emen and Cal@@ vi@@ à Town Hall civil servants at Mallorca &apos;s public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday .
The head of Cal@@ vi@@ à police on the holiday island of Maj@@ orca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by business@@ men and bar owners in the not@@ orious bin@@ ge drinking hot@@ spot of Mag@@ alu@@ f .
Chief In@@ spec@@ tor José Antonio Nav@@ ar@@ ro has been rem@@ anded in cust@@ ody following corruption claims made against him by several business@@ men from Punta Ball@@ ena , the street where most of Mag@@ alu@@ f &apos;s bars and night@@ clubs are located .
According to online daily Mallorca Di@@ ario , the claim@@ ants presented proof of ext@@ or@@ tion by polic@@ emen and Cal@@ vi@@ à Town Hall civil servants at the office of Maj@@ orca &apos;s anti-@@ corruption prosec@@ utor on Friday .
Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Gu@@ ards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be ques@@ tioned by a judge alongside Nav@@ ar@@ ro .
Spanish national daily AB@@ C reported the dis@@ gr@@ unt@@ led night@@ club owners as saying favour@@ i@@ tism by authorities was having a serious effect on their businesses .
&quot; It &apos;s not about making money anymore , it &apos;s about survi@@ ving , &quot; one of the business@@ men told the court .
You don &apos;t m@@ ess with our livel@@ ih@@ oods .
We have nothing to lose .
Mag@@ alu@@ f made international head@@ lines this summer as a result of a vir@@ al YouTube video which showed an 18-@@ year-old British holi@@ day@@ maker performing f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o on 24 men during a pub cra@@ w@@ l .
Island authorities have since attempted to cl@@ amp down on the dr@@ unk and dis@@ or@@ derly behaviour of Mag@@ alu@@ f holiday rev@@ ellers by minim@@ izing numbers on the not@@ orious alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fu@@ elled bar cra@@ w@@ ls .
In addition , the Play@@ house club where the f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o incident took place was forced to shut down for a year , while Play@@ house and the bar cra@@ w@@ l organiz@@ ers Car@@ n@@ age were jointly fined € 5@@ 5,000 ( $ 7@@ 3@@ ,000 ) .
The tourist resort of Mag@@ alu@@ f , mainly popular with young British holi@@ day@@ makers , has also seen numerous alco@@ hol@@ -@@ fu@@ elled accidents involving the cra@@ ze known as &quot; balcon@@ ing , &quot; where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool .
First day of spring marked with wet and blu@@ ster@@ y conditions imp@@ acting Adel@@ ai@@ de Airport flights
SP@@ R@@ ING has sprung a win@@ try surprise on southern South Australia , bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adel@@ ai@@ de Airport .
A further 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9@@ pm , following the 6.@@ 6@@ mm that fell overnight on Sunday .
The latest rain came cour@@ tes@@ y of a couple of short , blu@@ ster@@ y showers , including a bur@@ st that started just before 8@@ pm that dump@@ ed almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week , temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.@@ 8@@ C in the city .
The squ@@ ally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Mel@@ bour@@ ne to Adel@@ ai@@ de .
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.@@ 30@@ pm but was hit by wind@@ she@@ ar - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out .
Wind gu@@ sts were reaching about 50@@ km / h on the ground at Adel@@ ai@@ de Airport at the time .
F@@ light data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.@@ 40@@ p@@ m.
That flight &apos;s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an Em@@ ir@@ ates flight from Dubai and a Q@@ ant@@ as flight from Sydney .
A top of 16@@ C is forecast for Adel@@ ai@@ de on Tuesday , with the chance of a shower or two .
Mat@@ th@@ ies thinks : High time for the Internet Of Th@@ ings
Fac@@ ed with run@@ away advances in consumer technology , which threaten to turn our homes into high-tech control rooms , our re@@ porter , Bern@@ d Mat@@ th@@ ies , takes heart from one electronic g@@ ad@@ get that he really feels at home with .
As I write this , my eye cat@@ ches the spir@@ al cable , which connects the hand@@ set to the telephone , and I &apos;m thinking : W@@ ow ! How re@@ tro is that then ?
But it started me thinking : If the cable was not there , all the hand@@ sets would be lying sc@@ attered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more re@@ tro .
In any case , in the el@@ eph@@ ant@@ ine ( el@@ eph@@ ant@@ ine ?
No - a typ@@ ing error - electronics ) sector , the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rub@@ b@@ ish tomorrow - once bought , it &apos;s out of date .
And anyone , for example , who still has an old CR@@ T TV in their living room , is merely announc@@ ing to the world that they &apos;re not interested in TV@@ s !
So why these thoughts ?
Because the International Consumer Electron@@ ics Fair ( IFA ) in Berlin , once again showed us how in@@ competent we are when it comes to questions about technology .
The lay@@ man , who once knew , blind , how to operate a washing machine and a CD-@@ Player , is today faced with high@@ f@@ alu@@ tin expert talk about an array of g@@ ad@@ gets , the purpose of which he doesn &apos;t even understand . &quot; Conn@@ ected Home , W@@ ear@@ ables , Health Care and Ur@@ ban Technologies , &quot; are what the press office promise us .
Yes - and ?
What do you say to people , who clearly talk such gu@@ ff volunt@@ arily ?
Re@@ ally , they &apos;ve been trying to sell us the Internet of Th@@ ings for our homes , for the last 20 years .
So that your yo@@ gh@@ urt can place itself on your shopping list ; so that your fi@@ re-@@ alarm can tell you - when you &apos;re lying on the beach in the Mal@@ di@@ ves - that there &apos;s a fire in your study back home .
And w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if we could set our home air-conditioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ... ?
Yes - but that pres@@ up@@ poses that you have an air-@@ condi@@ tion@@ er in the first place .
However , one dream really will come true very soon : We lift our wr@@ ist wat@@ ches , and in a loud voice say &quot; V@@ acu@@ um ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum clean@@ er ro@@ bot begins to h@@ oo@@ ver .
F@@ ant@@ astic .
Everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution : &quot; The bound@@ ary between white and brown goods is becoming bl@@ urred , &quot; mut@@ ters an industry insi@@ der . You can connect your washing machine to your head@@ phone ; your steam oven can send you a weather report ; and your dat@@ a-@@ g@@ og@@ g@@ les can tell you how long your p@@ izza still has to go in the oven - but that &apos;s of little use if you &apos;re sitting in a traffic j@@ am .
From everyday experience , we also know : If you need a new model g@@ ad@@ get to urgently work , the battery will almost certainly be empty .
Which is another reason why the spir@@ al cable on the telephone will out-@@ live the next IFA exhi@@ bits in Berlin .
Israeli Children Retur@@ n to School After Gaza War
Th@@ ous@@ ands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Stri@@ p went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shel@@ ters as ro@@ ckets and mor@@ tar@@ s ra@@ ined on their communities during the 50-@@ day Israel@@ -@@ Hamas war , while schools in Gaza remained sh@@ ut@@ tered as the territory recover@@ ed from the fighting .
The start of school brought a sense of joy and exc@@ itement to rock@@ et-@@ scar@@ red communities in southern Israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
In the southern city of Ash@@ do@@ d , employees at the &quot; Pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; k@@ inder@@ garten , which was struck by a ro@@ cket , removed sh@@ rap@@ nel marks off the walls and sli@@ des ahead of the students &apos; arrival .
&quot; We are a little scar@@ ed but we are exc@@ ited , &quot; said Ron@@ it Bar@@ t , a resident of Ki@@ b@@ b@@ utz Sa@@ ad and an English teacher in its school .
A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine .
Her 11-@@ year-old daughter , Sh@@ ani Bar@@ t , said it felt a &quot; little bit wei@@ rd &quot; to suddenly be going back to school .
&quot; There were some difficult times and we didn &apos;t leave our houses at all , &quot; she said .
President R@@ eu@@ ven Ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ b@@ utz , which is located close to the Gaza border , to offer his support .
Until a ceas@@ e-@@ fire hal@@ ted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like Sa@@ ad remained in@@ doors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape ro@@ cket and mort@@ ar fire .
Many residents of Nah@@ al O@@ z , a community close to the Gaza fron@@ tier where a 4-@@ year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mort@@ ar shell , are hes@@ it@@ ant about coming back .
The Education Ministry said about a do@@ zen families still had not returned .
Their children have been placed in altern@@ ate schools for the time being .
Prime Minister Benjamin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in S@@ der@@ ot , a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire .
He urged the children to study hard and said &quot; we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . &quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-@@ ended tru@@ ce last Tuesday .
The ceas@@ e-@@ fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues un@@ resolved , such as Hamas &apos; demand for the lifting of an Israel@@ -@@ Egyptian block@@ ade of Gaza and the re@@ opening of Gaza &apos;s air and se@@ a@@ ports .
Israel wants Hamas to dis@@ arm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war .
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt .
The war killed more than 2,@@ 100 Palestinians , three-@@ quarters of whom were civilians and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to Palestinian and U.@@ N@@ . estimates .
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were milit@@ ants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
On the Israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a Thai worker , were killed .
Hamas and other Gaza milit@@ ants fi@@ red 4,@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ ckets and mor@@ tar@@ s at Israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
The Israeli military , mean@@ while , carried out more than 5,000 air@@ strikes and other attacks .
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 25@@ 0@@ ,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.@@ N@@ . schools turned into ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters .
With tens of thousands of people still in the shel@@ ters and fighting still ra@@ ging , education officials delayed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; I hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world &apos;s children and Jewish children , &quot; said Moh@@ am@@ mad Am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school .
Following the election in Sax@@ ony : CD@@ U Vice-@@ Chairman St@@ rob@@ l questions N@@ P@@ D-@@ bann@@ ing process
In view of the loss of votes by the German right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist party , N@@ P@@ D , in Sax@@ ony , the national CD@@ U-@@ Vice-@@ Chairman , Thomas St@@ rob@@ l , has called for an end of the on-@@ going N@@ P@@ D-@@ bann@@ ing process , which is taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court .
Berlin - According to CD@@ U National Vice-@@ Chairman , Thomas St@@ rob@@ l , the current trial taking place in the German Federal Constitutional Court to decide whether to ban the N@@ P@@ D from the political process , should be brought to an end .
According to the &quot; Leip@@ ziger Volks@@ zei@@ tung , &quot; the N@@ P@@ D performed worse than last time , &quot; said St@@ rob@@ l , who is also CD@@ U regional bo@@ ss in Bad@@ en-@@ Wür@@ tt@@ emberg .
That is a good development , one that should make us happy , and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the N@@ P@@ D in the bal@@ lot box , and not in the constitutional court .
On Sunday , the N@@ P@@ D nar@@ row@@ ly missed achieving the five percent barrier , which would have seen it enter parliament .
A first attempt at securing a ban of the right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist party failed in 2003 , because the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had inform@@ ants in the top ech@@ el@@ ons of the N@@ P@@ D .
In December 2013 the Bundes@@ rat submitted a further bann@@ ing action to the constitutional court , which is based in Karlsruhe , after spending a long time preparing the case .
The German government and Bund@@ est@@ ag did not take part in the bann@@ ing submission .
Har@@ burg : T@@ ents for new refugees
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es at Ne@@ ul@@ änder Platz will now be accommod@@ ated in t@@ ents .
The reception centre for refugees in Har@@ burg is full-@@ to-@@ bur@@ sting .
The German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go@@ -@@ ahead for the Red Cross to er@@ ect the three t@@ ents .
The local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy .
&quot; These one-@@ off actions only sti@@ r up more doubts in the minds of the public , and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner , &quot; said , for example , Britt@@ a Herr@@ mann , Chair@@ woman of the Green Party in the Har@@ burg district assembly .
Her party is calling on the Har@@ burg district authority to deplo@@ y empty houses to accommodate the refugees .
96 refugees can be accommod@@ ated in the three t@@ ents .
The reasons for the over-@@ crow@@ ding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help , as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation .
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
H@@ ous@@ ing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years , according to a wi@@ del@@ y-@@ wat@@ ched gau@@ ge .
The R@@ P Data Cor@@ e@@ Log@@ ic H@@ ed@@ onic home value index of Australian capital city d@@ well@@ ing prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August , R@@ P data said on Monday .
The rise brought the total gain over the June , July and August to 4.@@ 2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
Annual growth in prices came in at 10.@@ 9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013 , but the gains were not even@@ ly spread across the country .
R@@ P Data research director T@@ im La@@ w@@ less said Sydney and Mel@@ bour@@ ne are driving a two tier market .
The R@@ P Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.@@ 1 per cent in the past year , while Mel@@ bour@@ ne &apos;s were up by 11.@@ 7 per cent .
The next strongest markets were Adel@@ ai@@ de , B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e and Dar@@ win , with price rises aver@@ aging between five and six per cent .
At the other end of the scale was Can@@ ber@@ ra , hit by government spending cut@@ backs , where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year .
Mr La@@ w@@ less said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a &quot; real test &quot; for the market .
&quot; Consi@@ dering the ongoing high rate of auction clear@@ ance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it &apos;s likely that d@@ well@@ ing values will rise even further over the next three months , &quot; he said .
In an announcement to the regional German newspaper &apos; die Neue Presse &apos; P@@ ötz@@ l contradic@@ ted the comments of managing director , Pe@@ er Med@@ au , and said that the latter was beh@@ aving like a &quot; military general . &quot;
This was not the style of the college , he said .
He said that the Med@@ au family &quot; were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June .
They are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July &quot; .
At the same time he also said that the plans were not about &quot; final decisions already made , &quot; but rather about &quot; stating preferences &quot; .
He also said that the building work to wi@@ den the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Med@@ aus fear@@ ed .
It was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine met@@ re-@@ wide road .
We currently aim to wi@@ den it by 5.@@ 5 metres , which is one met@@ re wider than before , &quot; explained P@@ ötz@@ l .
P@@ ötz@@ l re@@ fut@@ es the argument of the Med@@ au concern , namely that its cost-@@ free parking places which belong to the school , will in future only be available for use by the college students .
It won &apos;t be a case of everywhere being par@@ ked up , because we have time to find intelligent solutions , as has been the case with other car parks , too .
Th@@ ink of the neighbours
The children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y Berg@@ wi@@ cht@@ el , which is situated on the space in question , and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run , is &quot; not to be imp@@ acted &quot; according to the college president .
He is far more concerned to point out &quot; that it &apos;s not only an issue concerning the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y , rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich@@ -@@ St@@ reib@@ -@@ Strasse and the 800 school@@ children of the adjacent secondary school .
It &apos;s therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Med@@ au gentlemen , &quot; he said .
Whether the criticism by the parents &apos; association for the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y is correct that the extension of the road will lead to &quot; one of the few remaining natural spaces in C@@ ob@@ ur@@ g being lost , &quot; he said the &quot; readers can decide for themselves . &quot;
At the beginning of October , P@@ ötz@@ l , together with the B@@ am@@ berg regional building authority , plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 &quot; and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context . &quot;
Pe@@ er Med@@ au informed the parents of the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y about the plans , last week .
Accordingly , the access for the new parking level will not now lead , as before , via the camp@@ us and Friedrich@@ -@@ St@@ reib@@ -@@ Strasse , but rather via the Med@@ au@@ -@@ Berg .
Thus , the narrow road must be wi@@ dened into two lan@@ es over a stretch of about one kilomet@@ re .
According to higher estimates of the Med@@ aus , the traffic in the Hoh@@ en@@ f@@ els castle park would increase ten-@@ fold .
They are talking of 2000 vehicles every day .
Meanwhile , the town council refused to comment .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f reti@@ res from German National Hand@@ ball team
Hol@@ ger G@@ land@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the German National team .
The 31 year-old from German Bundes@@ lig@@ a side S@@ G Fl@@ ens@@ burg-@@ Han@@ de@@ wit@@ t said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision .
&quot; It was not an easy decision to make , but I &apos;ve been thinking about it for months .
The time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career , &quot; announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k-@@ Page .
He reti@@ res from international competition with a record of 16@@ 7 national games and 5@@ 76 goals for Germany .
The power@@ ful@@ -@@ thro@@ wing right-@@ back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ League winners from Fl@@ ens@@ burg , and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head coach , D@@ ag@@ ur Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ sson .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f said he had had a &quot; nice long talk &quot; with the Icel@@ ander , who will select his squ@@ ad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland .
His ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me , as I am sure they will also insp@@ ire my long-term te@@ amm@@ ates and my success@@ ors , too .
&quot; I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so , and the double burden of also playing for the national team w@@ ou@@ ld@@ n@@ `@@ t allow me to do that . &quot;
The left-@@ h@@ ander fear@@ ed his career might end in 2012 when he had a he@@ el infection .
Due to ach@@ il@@ les t@@ end@@ on problems he was given a cor@@ tis@@ one injection by doctors working with the German Hand@@ ball Association , and this caused severe s@@ well@@ ing of his foot .
He needed an emergency operation and two further sur@@ geri@@ es as well .
G@@ land@@ or@@ f then brought a legal action against the team doctor ; however , this ended in a settlement .
T@@ welve years as a professional and el@@ even years with the national team would take their toll on any player .
&quot; I have some health issues I can &apos;t ignore anymore .
After three foot@@ -@@ sur@@ geri@@ es within a short period of time in 2012 , caused by inf@@ ections , I have never been able to control my blood pressure .
I &apos;ve also got some other minor issues related - wear and te@@ ar .
At the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head , but I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ `@@ t play tri@@ cks with my body , &quot; he explained in an interview with German magazine Hand@@ ball Time .
He would only consider a com@@ eb@@ ack if really necessary .
&quot; If we are in real big trouble , then I might consider it , &quot; the two-@@ time father told the magazine .
&quot; But I can count the years I will continue to play hand@@ ball with one hand .
And I have to admit that I have become really hum@@ ble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
After my career I would like to walk straight , to be honest . &quot;
Besides the 2007 World Championship he also won the Champ@@ ions League in May and the E@@ H@@ F-@@ Cup in 2008 ( H@@ S@@ G Nord@@ horn ) and 2010 ( T@@ B@@ V L@@ em@@ go ) .
He also won the Cup W@@ inners Cup with Fl@@ ens@@ burg in 2012 .
German economy as shr@@ unk by 0.@@ 2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have put a cur@@ b on the German economy in the the second quarter .
The Gro@@ ss Dom@@ estic Product s@@ ank from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.@@ 2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter .
This was announced by the German Office for National St@@ atis@@ tics , which thereby confirmed previous estimates .
Consu@@ mption alone was a sp@@ ur to the economy in the early part of the year , whilst investments were down .
Foreign goods trade had slow@@ ed , too .
Due to the strong start to the year , figures for first half-@@ year GDP were up 0.@@ 8 percent from the second quarter of 2013 .
Hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the destination of &quot; Mün@@ ster@@ land-@@ M@@ oo@@ iste &quot; , which lead through the city on Sunday .
The city of Hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an invasion of Dutch &quot; Fi@@ etzen ri@@ ders &quot; on Sunday .
The largest cycling federation in Holland , NT@@ F@@ U , st@@ aged the so-called &quot; Mün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de-@@ M@@ oo@@ iste &quot; .
In other words , the largest bike ride straight through Mün@@ ster@@ land , a bike ri@@ der &apos;s paradise close to Holland .
By regi@@ stering , more than 1000 participants than@@ ked J@@ os ter Hu@@ erne for having organized this tour through Mün@@ ster@@ land .
The tour was adverti@@ sed in several professional journ@@ als , and offered to those interested .
We are from Den Hel@@ der , and dro@@ ve here over night so we could take part in the tour .
We would also like to get know Mün@@ ster@@ land a bit better in the same way &quot; , the cy@@ cli@@ sts eag@@ erly said , looking forward to the route through Stein@@ fur@@ t , Bor@@ ken and Co@@ es@@ feld .
After regi@@ stering at the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s club house , St@@ a .
Kath@@ ar@@ ina started off with a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city and over the em@@ bank@@ ment , which is also where the start line was .
Then , the route , which was adverti@@ sed in three different categories , headed in the direction of Her@@ ren@@ holz via Schö@@ pp@@ inger Berg towards Co@@ es@@ feld , passing by H@@ avi@@ x@@ beck and Bill@@ er@@ beck , and then back to Hor@@ st@@ mar .
The ri@@ ders prove just how good a shape they are in : stret@@ ches of 95 kilometers at an altitude of 1@@ 175 meters , 120 kilometers with an altitude of 14@@ 75 meters , and 14@@ 5 kilometers with an altitude of 17@@ 75 meters .
They were fed and water@@ ed on their way back in H@@ avi@@ x@@ beck and Bill@@ er@@ beck .
Chief organiz@@ er , J@@ os ter Hu@@ erne , and dep@@ uty may@@ or , Hein@@ z L@@ öl@@ fing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
We are happy , and it was a wonderful experience for all participants .
The organization went smoothly , with no issues , and there were no n@@ asty incidents &quot; , Hein@@ z L@@ öl@@ fing positively concluded with regard to the event .
Unfortunately , there were not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped for , which is presum@@ ably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain .
&quot; We shall see each other in 2015 , hopefully with nice weather , on either 30 August , or on another weekend &quot; , the ri@@ ders promised , but whatever the weather , they will return to Mün@@ ster@@ land , and the organiz@@ ers will plan a repeat .
Kon@@ stanti@@ n W@@ ecker - sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ously honest mem@@ o@@ irs
The 28@@ 7-@@ page &quot; Mon@@ k and War@@ ri@@ or &quot; by Kon@@ stanti@@ n W@@ ecker , song writer , p@@ aci@@ f@@ ist , political activ@@ ist and ex-@@ pris@@ oner , is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a bi@@ ography
Com@@ posed more as a collection of thou@@ ght-@@ provo@@ king ideas rather than a chron@@ ological history , the author , who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947 , has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable son@@ g-@@ text .
And he has been un@@ st@@ int@@ ingly honest throughout : From ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating as a gramm@@ ar school pup@@ il to sh@@ op@@ lifting and dru@@ g-@@ taking , he has left none of his human weaknesses unt@@ old .
And this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so toler@@ ant towards his fellow man .
As a result , abstra@@ ct concepts , which he liber@@ ally uses throughout the text , take on a clearer , more important meaning : Love ; Sou@@ l ; E@@ go ; Exist@@ ing in the Here and Now ; Spir@@ itu@@ ality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts , in a highly philosophi@@ cal , but also very personal way .
And he explains why he is p@@ aci@@ f@@ ist ; what lies behind his criticism of society ; his political heart and soul ; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and moul@@ ded - not only by music ( he was an opera lo@@ ver who became a soul and rock musi@@ cian ) but by his prison experience , too .
He says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the mon@@ ks , who live their lives by a process of &quot; sub@@ trac@@ tion &quot; whereby they &quot; rid themselves of all things su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
In-@@ between all the high@@ bro@@ w stuff , there are also short an@@ ec@@ dot@@ es of a more ear@@ thy nature - for example , fi@@ st-@@ fi@@ ghts in a bar frequ@@ ented by G@@ Is , or else a cra@@ zy drive on the motorway , in which he dro@@ ve full-@@ on straight into a tree .
And he &apos;s un@@ spar@@ ing also , as he describes that too .
L@@ enny Henry : My father never hu@@ g@@ ged me .
N@@ ever said &quot; I love you &quot;
Henry was one of seven children born to Jam@@ a@@ ican immigrants in Du@@ d@@ ley in the Mid@@ lands in 1958 .
His father , who died when Henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
Henry is re@@ hear@@ sing a com@@ edy , Ru@@ dy &apos;s R@@ are Records , which is based in part on an imag@@ inary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series .
The sound@@ track is a mix of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p and the tun@@ es are up@@ beat .
But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood .
There was &quot; a lot &quot; of therapy after his mother died and Henry is refl@@ ective about his relationship with his father .
He was very unknow@@ able .
You never saw his face , you just heard his voice : &apos; Stop the noise .
Le@@ ave your sister alone .
Mo@@ ve !
I want to watch the cri@@ cket .
My older brothers Se@@ ym@@ our and Hilton - who were grow@@ n@@ -up when I was a k@@ id - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , the beauty of the stro@@ ke in cri@@ cket .
I never had a conversation with him like that .
He was this uns@@ mil@@ ing blo@@ ke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
Recently Henry opened a found@@ ry in Du@@ d@@ ley and , although conditions were better than in his father &apos;s day , he got a sn@@ ap@@ shot of what life must have been like for him .
It &apos;s a bit bri@@ ghter now but they &apos;re dark , smo@@ ky , Sty@@ gi@@ an lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th@@ ine dep@@ ths with bur@@ sts of fl@@ ame and smoke and lots of so@@ ot .
My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you &apos;d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would w@@ ash the found@@ ry off him .
When I wal@@ ked round it , I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my estim@@ ation of him went up .
None the less , Henry emerged from a childhood stri@@ pped of par@@ ental aff@@ ection .
My dad never did hu@@ gging , never said , &apos; I love you &apos; .
It wasn &apos;t until my m@@ um was poor@@ ly near the end of her life that we started saying &apos; I love you , I love you , I love you .
Having a daughter of his own , Billi@@ e , with Da@@ wn French , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
Could you stop with the &quot; I love you &quot; ?
Just stop hu@@ gging me !
D@@ ad , I &apos;m 22 !
With Da@@ wn French .
Why w@@ ouldn &apos;t I be friends with her ?
She &apos;s a great m@@ um
He &apos;s still very good friends with French , to whom he was married for 25 years .
Da@@ wn &apos;s a good person .
Why w@@ ouldn &apos;t I be friends with Da@@ wn ?
She &apos;s a great m@@ um .
Henry &apos;s own mother was di@@ ab@@ etic .
It was one of the things that killed her .
So when I became very , very over@@ weight and started getting di@@ ab@@ etic symptoms , my doctor said , &apos; You &apos;ve got to be radical .
So I went on a big fitness thing , and I also had to go on a dr@@ astic diet to reverse the symptoms .
It &apos;s very hard .
And it &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
Nob@@ ody likes eating car@@ ro@@ ts .
Henry &apos;s change in career tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , clo@@ se-@@ cro@@ pped be@@ ard .
Since he won critical acc@@ la@@ im for his O@@ th@@ ello , he has become en@@ gross@@ ed in the theatre .
Com@@ edy of Er@@ rors followed , as did F@@ ences by August Wil@@ son .
It &apos;s a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ e@@ dies that have uph@@ ol@@ stered his busy working life .
He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
A DJ spot@@ ted him on stage doing impres@@ sions and wrote to New Fac@@ es about him .
His TV career was launched in the mid@@ -S@@ even@@ ties : &quot; For quite a long time I was the only black impres@@ sion@@ ist / com@@ edi@@ an on tel@@ ly . &quot;
He learnt on the job .
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye , I had to learn how to be an efficient j@@ ok@@ e-@@ delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985 , whilst being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
L@@ enny on New Fac@@ es in 1975
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Min@@ str@@ el Show , a light entertainment programme in which people &quot; black@@ ed up , &quot; Henry found himself performing his com@@ edy in it for five years .
My family were very un@@ comfortable about it .
I sort of wish it had never happened , but I don &apos;t regret that I did it .
Although it was a wei@@ rd , re@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible position to be in , I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd .
But what was an &quot; awar@@ d-@@ winning light entertainment st@@ ap@@ le of British television for years and years &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ t@@ esque par@@ ody of black people . &quot;
In@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing characters who both lam@@ po@@ oned and celebrated black British culture , Henry worked on the alternative com@@ edy circuit in the Ei@@ gh@@ ties .
The first series of The L@@ enny Henry Show ai@@ red in 1984 , and in the N@@ ine@@ ties he was known as , among other things , chef G@@ are@@ th Black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series Chef ! .
Ad@@ verti@@ sements , docum@@ ent@@ aries , TV series and parts in films consum@@ ed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series , L@@ enn@@ y@@ Hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv , he thought : &quot; What are you going to do next , L@@ en , because it all feels a bit like you &apos;re marking time or you &apos;re slightly going side@@ ways . &quot;
What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What &apos;s So Great About ... ?
The first was on Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
I had a real all@@ ergy to Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
I wasn &apos;t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class white people with ti@@ ghts and a cab@@ b@@ age down the front .
So I was very fri@@ gh@@ tened of it .
Every@@ body we inter@@ viewed on that show , Peter Hall , Tre@@ vor N@@ un@@ n , Adri@@ an L@@ ester , Ju@@ di Den@@ ch , said , &apos; You should try it .
Don &apos;t s@@ lag it off if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you &apos;ll understand why we all love Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so much .
Henry delivered 20 lines of O@@ th@@ ello &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was h@@ oo@@ ked .
It gave me the feeling that I could do it .
It &apos;s almost like I had my head put on straight for me .
&apos;@@ This is what it &apos;s about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
So the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
And it was a success .
They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn &apos;t quite happen .
So@@ on he was star@@ ring in Com@@ edy of Er@@ rors .
Su@@ ddenly I &apos;m at the National Theatre and I just couldn &apos;t quite believe it .
There was one moment where I thought , &apos; O@@ h , you &apos;ve changed . &quot; &quot;
There was a technical fault and Henry inst@@ inc@@ tively felt that it was his job to keep the audience enter@@ tained .
&quot; A little voice inside me said , &apos; You &apos;re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . &quot; &quot;
Instead , the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved .
I wal@@ ked off the stage and something in me went , &quot; O@@ h , thank God &quot; .
It &apos;s not my responsibility .
I can let somebody else sort it out .
&apos;@@ You &apos;re in a play , stay in character . &quot; &quot;
Henry appearing in F@@ ences at the Du@@ ch@@ ess Theatre
Learning his lines for F@@ ences was challenging .
Pan@@ ic &apos;s quite good , it sti@@ ff@@ ens the s@@ ine@@ ws .
That was well received too , so it &apos;s like a big sign from the go@@ ds , saying , &apos; This is what you should be doing . &quot; &quot;
He says this , of course , in a BO@@ OM@@ ING voice .
So I &apos;m sti@@ cking with it .
I &apos;m really lo@@ ving it .
I love being in a re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room .
Henry still has a com@@ edi@@ an &apos;s brain , though - throughout , our conversation is broken with f@@ las@@ hes of his hum@@ our as he sli@@ ps in and out of impres@@ sions .
I &apos;m just choosing not to do stand@@ -up because that thing of getting instant grati@@ fication from a room full of stran@@ gers I gu@@ ess is kind of dangerous .
If you &apos;re constantly seeking that it can lead to a bri@@ ck wall .
I do Live at the Ap@@ oll@@ o sometimes when I want to , but generally it doesn &apos;t flo@@ at my boat like it used to .
I ask whether he &apos;ll ever do another stand@@ -up tour .
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever want to give that up .
So this is his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
I think so .
I like being an actor .
It &apos;s good fun .
You &apos;re always telling a story and that &apos;s a great place to be .
I love stories .
People love stories .
Hou@@ th@@ i re@@ bels block roads in Y@@ emen@@ i capital
In the conflict between the shi@@ ite Hou@@ th@@ i re@@ bels and the Y@@ emen government , the Hou@@ this have called for civil di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , San@@ a@@ a .
Hou@@ th@@ i supporters had occupied central roads in San@@ a@@ a on Monday , said a spo@@ kes@@ man of the Hou@@ th@@ i party &quot; Ans@@ ar Allah . &quot;
Access to the parliament was blocked as well .
Y@@ emen@@ i media report that there is traffic chaos in the capital .
According to a report in the on-line edition of the newspaper &quot; Y@@ emen Post &quot; Hou@@ th@@ i leader Ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ Hu@@ th@@ i called for these actions on Sunday evening .
The report said that Hu@@ th@@ i threatened further escal@@ ation of the conflict , should his demands not be met .
The shi@@ ite Hou@@ this are fighting for more independence f@@ ro the sun@@ ni@@ -@@ ruled Y@@ emen , and are demanding that the government res@@ ign .
According to the report , Hou@@ th@@ i tri@@ bes have been besi@@ eg@@ ing the Y@@ emen@@ i capital for almost two weeks .
Around 30@@ ,000 re@@ bels had set up protest camps on the major access routes to San@@ a@@ a .

Kenya regi@@ sters civil servants to target &apos; gh@@ o@@ st work@@ ers@@ &apos;
Kenya has started biom@@ etri@@ cally regi@@ stering all civil servants in an attempt to remove &quot; gh@@ o@@ st workers &quot; from the government &apos;s pay@@ roll .
Emp@@ lo@@ yees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid , a government statement said .
The government susp@@ ects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service .
President U@@ hur@@ u Ken@@ y@@ att@@ a ple@@ dged to cur@@ b corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013 .
An audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1@@ m ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) a month was lost in payments to &quot; gh@@ o@@ st workers &quot; and other financial mal@@ practice .
The government susp@@ ects that salaries continue to be deposi@@ ted into bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the public service , reports the BBC &apos;s W@@ any@@ ama Ch@@ eb@@ usi@@ ri from the capital , Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi .
All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biom@@ etric registration exercise , a government statement said .
Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the pay@@ roll , it said .
&quot; This exercise will contribute significantly to the ration@@ alization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to clean@@ se the pay@@ roll at both levels of govern@@ ment@@ - hence bring a stop to the issue of &apos; gh@@ o@@ st workers &apos; , &quot; said An@@ ne Wa@@ ig@@ ur@@ u , the cab@@ inet secret@@ ary in the Ministry of Dev@@ ol@@ ution and Pl@@ anning .
The scandal surrounding arts advis@@ or , Hel@@ ge A@@ chen@@ bach , will be heard for the first time in court on 11 November .

The news was announced by a court spo@@ kes@@ woman on Monday .
According to the statement of claim , when purchasing the works of art and antique cars , A@@ chen@@ bach conn@@ ed them , and invo@@ ic@@ ed Ber@@ th@@ old Al@@ bre@@ cht for more than the actual sales price .
In so doing , the agreed commission also turned out to be more .
A@@ chen@@ bach purchased valu@@ ables for Al@@ bre@@ cht for 12@@ 1 million euros .
Children need roots and w@@ ings
He was a school teacher for 44 years , 23 of which he was the principal .
During his teaching time , Man@@ fred Richter got to know many school@@ children who are now fully-@@ grown adults living in Peter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen and Koll@@ bach .
His methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child .
Mount Sn@@ ě@@ ž@@ ka is one of the best-@@ known peaks in the Czech Gi@@ ant Mountains .
Man@@ fred Richter lo@@ ves this painting of a picture from his childhood home .
Richter was born in 1930 in Trau@@ ten@@ au / Nord@@ b@@ öh@@ men , today &apos;s Tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
He was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14 , after he had been a secondary school pup@@ il for four years .
One year later the Germans living in the Su@@ det@@ enland were dispos@@ s@@ essed .
Within half an hour , the family had to leave their home .
After a few months spent in a holding camp , they moved to Bavaria in 194@@ 6 - in a goods train .
That was how he came to live in S@@ enk@@ endorf , in Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
The teacher training course was in B@@ am@@ berg .
In order to get to the school , Man@@ fred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station ; take the train to B@@ am@@ berg ; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school ; and then make the return journey home .
After two months . Man@@ fred Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cross Home in B@@ am@@ berg , in a sleeping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students .
In 195@@ 1 , he took his first state ex@@ am , and his second in 195@@ 4 , after spending three further years as a teaching candidate .
Since Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia had no free teaching place for him , he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 195@@ 4 at a school in Koll@@ bach .
The &quot; Young Women &apos;s Room &quot; was his first &quot; Service Fl@@ at &quot; in the school building .
In 1958 , he moved into the new@@ -@@ build teacher accommodation next door to the school , into a three-@@ room service flat .
Man@@ fred Richter bought this house in 1980 , after the school in Koll@@ bach was closed in 1968 .
Until then , the school district association of Peter@@ sh@@ aus@@ en-@@ Koll@@ bach had three classes in Koll@@ bach and five in Peter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
In the school year of 1968 / 69 , these classes were accommod@@ ated in Peter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , in today &apos;s town hall .
When the In@@ der@@ s@@ dorf Scho@@ ols Association was founded , the only school left in the loc@@ ality was the primary school .
In order to avoid a der@@ an@@ king of position in the now smaller school , the then de@@ an , Georg Sig@@ l decided to move to Karls@@ feld - and Man@@ fred Richter became his successor .
However , Peter@@ sh@@ au@@ sen continued to grow , and so the children and their teachers , from September 1982 onwards , could move into the present@@ -@@ day building , which has since been extended , after Richter took his retirement .
Man@@ fred Richter pra@@ ises the un@@ complicated manner and spirit of gener@@ o@@ sity of the then Mayor , Ludwig Gö@@ tz , who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work@@ -@@ room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 exten@@ sions - although the council guidelines governing school@@ -@@ building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work .
&quot; Mayor Gö@@ tz was a great friend of the school , &quot; rec@@ alls Richter , with gratitude .
Throughout his whole career , Man@@ fred Richter never for@@ got a reply given in a speech by a government representative , in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice : &quot; One should never forget to love &quot; . Man@@ fred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
&quot; One has to give children two things : Ro@@ ots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 84 year-old .
But experience has also taught him that : &quot; One doesn &apos;t always achieve that . &quot; Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children , is unclear .
In any case , Richter &apos;s methods were at times un@@ conventional .
If school children got into fi@@ ghts , they were not given pun@@ ish@@ ments like , for example , writing out lines or serving a detention .
At the cost of the council , Richter bought two p@@ airs of box@@ ing glo@@ ves , and then let the two ant@@ agon@@ ists fight it out , even if this did occasionally produce a black@@ -@@ eye .
For the benefit of the school , Richter nur@@ tured a good relationship with the then Mayor , Ludwig Gö@@ tz ( CS@@ U ) .
Following his retirement , Richter , who had no political alleg@@ i@@ ances , was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CS@@ U in 1996 .
However , Richter finished in sixth and joined the CS@@ U .
180 kilometres in three days
HR@@ 4-@@ C@@ Y@@ C@@ LE TO@@ UR 700 cy@@ cli@@ sts are taking a bre@@ ather in the health resort of Bad Salz@@ hausen and Sch@@ otten
There is nothing particular out of the ordinary about tour@@ ing cy@@ cli@@ sts take a rest in Bad Salz@@ hausen or in Sch@@ otten .
However , on Friday , the she@@ er numbers of those res@@ ting up was striking : The 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour , together with their ent@@ our@@ ages , were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salz@@ hausen , and they would later be attending an open air party in the Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park in Sch@@ otten , too .
Under the logo &quot; Cy@@ cling and celebr@@ ating along the new@@ ly-@@ discovered routes between Ni@@ d@@ da and Kin@@ zig , &quot; the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vil@@ bel and had listened to a concert there by Van B@@ aker &amp; Band .
On Friday it was down to business : The ri@@ ders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via Flor@@ stadt to Bad Salz@@ hausen and then further on to Sch@@ otten .
In Bad Salz@@ hausen , the spor@@ ts@@ men@@ -and-@@ women were gre@@ eted by may@@ or Hans@@ -@@ Peter Se@@ um , who had ri@@ dden off the star@@ t-@@ line in Bad Vil@@ bel on his own bike , and the bo@@ ss of the municipal company Bad Salz@@ hausen , Pet@@ ra Schw@@ ing-@@ Dör@@ ing .
All sorts of food and drink had been prepared , to refres@@ h body and mind : The local women from R@@ anst@@ adt and Nieder@@ -@@ Mo@@ ck@@ stadt had bak@@ ed 85 app@@ le@@ - , pl@@ um@@ - and che@@ es@@ ec@@ akes - as well as stre@@ us@@ el c@@ ake which the in@@ tre@@ p@@ id ri@@ ders let m@@ elt in their mou@@ ths .
&quot; Such c@@ akes only the local women can make , &quot; pra@@ ised the ri@@ der from A@@ ul@@ endi@@ eb@@ ach , at the same time as he ordered another sli@@ ce .
At the drinks stand of the Gei@@ ß@@ -@@ Ni@@ d@@ da g@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um club , the ri@@ ders could acquire cold drinks .
The &quot; Du@@ o Bra@@ vo &quot; enter@@ tained the visitors with well-known mel@@ o@@ dies from Oper@@ ett@@ as and Musi@@ c@@ als and re@@ ap@@ ed enthusiastic appl@@ ause .
The lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect .
One gentlem@@ an even received a head@@ -@@ massage from his lady partner : &quot; He certainly earned it - after all , he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off , earlier in the day . &quot;
Meanwhile , the may@@ or and the company bo@@ ss still had work to do : They were inter@@ viewed at the foun@@ tain in front of the water@@ ing-@@ hole inn , the Trink@@ kur@@ haus , by re@@ porter , Rain@@ er Jan@@ ke , and took their radio opportunity to give a big thum@@ bs up for Bad Salz@@ hausen .
Even head of promo@@ tions , To@@ bi@@ as Ha@@ gen , who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004 , could only get a short rest , as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology .
His pick@@ -up truck , in which he used three teleph@@ ones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-@@ strong H@@ essen Police team ; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports , also needed a check .
&quot; The majority of ri@@ ders come from the Rhein@@ -@@ Ma@@ in-@@ Region , &quot; he explained , &quot; but ri@@ ders have also come from G@@ ießen and Ful@@ da , from Lau@@ ter@@ bach or from the Ta@@ un@@ us and even from many towns in West@@ f@@ alia .
The number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay .
C@@ ateg@@ ory 1 ri@@ ders are accommod@@ ated in hotels , with C@@ ateg@@ ory 2 ri@@ ders being put up in host@@ el-@@ style lo@@ dging .
As the ri@@ ders set out again on the road , they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort : &quot; B@@ ye ! &quot;
&quot; It was very nice in Bad Salz@@ hausen ! &quot; they sh@@ ou@@ ted , as they wav@@ ed good@@ by@@ e .
After arriving in Sch@@ otten , the group could take a short rest .
But then in the evening , the ri@@ ders were requested to go to the idyllic Alt@@ eb@@ urg@@ park .
Under the guidance of manager of the Sch@@ otten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing ( GT@@ S ) the Park had acquired a lovely fes@@ tive ambience and , of course , there were plenty of nice ni@@ b@@ bles , such as Fl@@ amm@@ ku@@ chen with well-@@ ch@@ illed Feder@@ wei@@ ßer wine , too .
May@@ or@@ ess Sus@@ anne Sch@@ a@@ ab , GT@@ S-@@ bo@@ ss , Markus Ho@@ ß@@ feld and MS@@ C-@@ Chairman , Wolfgang Wag@@ ner@@ -S@@ ach@@ s , in his capacity as board member of the H@@ ess@@ en-@@ Th@@ ür@@ ingen section of the AD@@ AC welcomed the visitors .
The three were visi@@ bly delighted by the &quot; ro@@ aring trade in Sch@@ otten . &quot;
DJ To@@ bi@@ as Ha@@ gen opened the dancing stage .
The cy@@ cli@@ sts were happy to have the chance to show off their dancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting fe@@ ats on their bicy@@ cles earlier in the day .
The appeared among the guests an increasing number of local people , who were as attracted by the pleasant atmosphere as much as the mass crowd of ri@@ ders .
On the second day of the tour program , the ri@@ ders would call at the st@@ opping points of Bir@@ stein ; W@@ äch@@ ter@@ s@@ bach ; and Bad Or@@ b - including a concert with the T@@ ren@@ k@@ wal@@ dern .
Yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , the spor@@ ts@@ men@@ -and-@@ women arrived back in Bad Vil@@ bel once again .
T@@ ens of Turkish Po@@ lic@@ emen Ar@@ res@@ ted over &apos; Pl@@ ot@@ ting &apos; against Go@@ v &apos;t
A total of 33 police officers have been det@@ ained in Turkey on susp@@ ici@@ ons of &apos; pl@@ ot@@ ting against the government &apos; , local media out@@ lets say .
Police officials have not immediately comm@@ ented .
Among the det@@ ain@@ ees were 14 high-@@ ranking officers , according to Hur@@ ri@@ yet Da@@ ily News .
Some of them were involved in last December &apos;s corruption prob@@ es target@@ ing government officials , including four government ministers .
In July a number of Turkish polic@@ emen were arrested for alle@@ ge@@ dly having set up an organized criminal gang and having t@@ apped phone number .

Not all children back to school in Ukraine
Scho@@ ols across most of Ukraine re@@ opened their doors on Monday ( September 1 ) , after the summer holidays .
The day is traditionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Ar@@ sen@@ y Y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk took his daughter to school .
While there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
The first of September ceremony was not held in every school .
There is not a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine .
We must fight for a peaceful sky .
The whole of Ukraine , a huge joint Ukrainian &apos;s people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
A@@ le@@ ks@@ an Past@@ uk@@ ho@@ v , the head teacher of Sla@@ vi@@ ans@@ k School , attended by Y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk &apos;s daughter , spoke in Russian .
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
The first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered shi@@ rts , carrying bal@@ lo@@ ons and giving flowers to their teachers .
In R@@ ona Fair@@ head , the BBC may have found the form@@ idable chief it needs
She comes tra@@ iling clou@@ ds of gl@@ ory from the world of banking , media management and the inner conc@@ la@@ ves of the T@@ ory party .
Indeed , she has had fron@@ t@@ line experience of her own .
Her career began at global management consultants B@@ ain and Co , then progres@@ sed via Morgan Stan@@ ley , Bom@@ b@@ adi@@ er , IC@@ I and the media world of Pear@@ sons .
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years , resign@@ ing when the top job at its parent company Pear@@ son &apos;s went to a junior male colleague .
Her pay@@ -@@ off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
Her political rating is stur@@ dy , too .
She was recommended to David Cam@@ eron by Lord Brow@@ ne , the former head of B@@ P , when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whit@@ eh@@ all : she became a cab@@ inet office advis@@ er .
Her husband is a former T@@ ory coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or .
Back in May , I described the chairman &apos;s job as a po@@ is@@ oned ch@@ ali@@ ce .
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner parad@@ ox to its structure .
The trust faces in two directions : in@@ wards as the upper tier of the BBC &apos;s own management hierarch@@ y , but also out@@ wards as the voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go aw@@ ry .
This is an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ op@@ oly calling for complete ro@@ ot-@@ and-@@ branch reform .
But what incoming chairman would risk coming in , cr@@ ash@@ ing around and dismant@@ ling an institution as complex as a Chinese d@@ yn@@ asty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
It &apos;s a difficult call .
If that weren &apos;t tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status over@@ hau@@ led .
As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certain@@ ties , the im@@ min@@ ent negotiation of the licence fee is frau@@ ght with especi@@ al danger for the BBC .
For the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 a year , the British public bu@@ ys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
The BBC tells a good story : it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households , and costs each one of them just 40@@ p a day .
What &apos;s more , apparently the Be@@ eb &apos;s popularity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
Pat@@ terns of watching and using the BBC have changed : I receive news head@@ lines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed programmes with i@@ Player .
But it remains a mu@@ ch-@@ loved and form@@ idable institution .
It needs a form@@ idable chairman - I hope it has found one .
Texas &apos; Per@@ ry S@@ ays Dis@@ par@@ aging T@@ we@@ et Un@@ authorized
A t@@ we@@ et from Republic@@ an Texas Go@@ v. R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s verified account on Sunday night included a di@@ spar@@ aging image of the Democratic district att@@ or@@ ney who is at the center of his criminal indic@@ t@@ ment on charges of abuse of power .
The t@@ we@@ et was later deleted , followed by another from Per@@ ry &apos;s account that dis@@ av@@ owed the post .
A t@@ we@@ et just went out from my account that was un@@ authorized .
&quot; I do not con@@ done the t@@ we@@ et and I have taken it down , &quot; the later post said .
Per@@ ry ai@@ des did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
Although the t@@ we@@ ets were sent from Per@@ ry &apos;s verified account , it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed .
The earlier t@@ we@@ et posted an un@@ flat@@ tering mo@@ ck image of Tra@@ vis County District Att@@ or@@ ney Ro@@ sem@@ ary L@@ ehm@@ berg , who was convic@@ ted of dr@@ unken driving in April 2013 .
Per@@ ry v@@ et@@ o@@ ed funds to her office when she refused to res@@ ign , which led to a grand jury in Aus@@ tin this month indic@@ ting Per@@ ry - who is a potential 20@@ 16 presidential candidate .
The cap@@ tion on the t@@ we@@ et reads : &quot; I don &apos;t always drive dr@@ unk at 3@@ x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do , I indic@@ t Go@@ v. Per@@ ry for calling me out about it . &quot;
I am the most dr@@ unk Democ@@ rat in Texas .
L@@ ehm@@ berg &apos;s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Per@@ ry .
It was handled by Michael Mc@@ Cru@@ m , a San Antoni@@ o-@@ based special prosec@@ utor who was assigned by a Republic@@ an judge .
Per@@ ry has ple@@ aded not guilty and called the charges a political p@@ lo@@ y .
His high-@@ powered legal team has asked the judge over@@ seeing the case to dis@@ miss the indic@@ t@@ ment , claiming that the law being used to prosec@@ ute the lon@@ gest@@ -@@ serving govern@@ or in Texas history is un@@ constitu@@ tionally vague .
Per@@ ry cut off $ 7.@@ 5 million in state funds to the state &apos;s Public Integr@@ ity Unit - which is based in Tra@@ vis County and prosec@@ utes public corruption in Texas - when L@@ ehm@@ berg refused to res@@ ign .
That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-@@ le@@ aning wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
Per@@ ry &apos;s verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes fam@@ ously .
After finishing in fifth place in the I@@ ow@@ a c@@ auc@@ uses during his 2012 presidential campaign , Per@@ ry addressed speculation that he might call it qu@@ its with a t@@ we@@ et of a photo of himself j@@ og@@ ging near a lake , and the words , &quot; Here we come South Carol@@ ina ! &quot;
Ber@@ kel@@ ey says housing market back to &quot; normal &quot;
One of London &apos;s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in sou@@ theast England has &quot; rever@@ ted &quot; to normal levels of activity .
Hom@@ es in the capital have been the subject of re@@ d-@@ hot demand and sur@@ ging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bub@@ ble promp@@ ting the Bank of England to impose limits on mort@@ gage bor@@ rowing in June .
Tony P@@ id@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of up@@ market hous@@ eb@@ u@@ il@@ der Ber@@ kel@@ ey , on Monday said : &quot; Since the start of the current financial year , the market has rever@@ ted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , &quot; adding that this offered a &quot; stable operating environment . &quot;
London &apos;s property market far@@ ed well during the down@@ turn as foreign bu@@ yers pil@@ ed into the capital .
Prices in the city have le@@ ap@@ t 18.@@ 5 per cent in the past year alone , according to Land Regi@@ stry data , far out@@ stri@@ pping the 6.@@ 7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole .
A@@ verage selling prices on Ber@@ kel@@ ey &apos;s private , affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 at the end of April .
However , a strengthening po@@ und has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers - some of whom have also been det@@ er@@ red by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential &quot; man@@ sion tax &quot; ahead of the general election next May .
London estate agent Fo@@ x@@ tons last week warned that April &apos;s Mor@@ t@@ gage Market Review , which introduced tou@@ gher lending rules , would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
Fres@@ h data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mort@@ gage appro@@ vals in July , further suggest@@ ing the housing market is cooling .
Hamp@@ tons International , another estate agent , has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sen@@ timent is already starting to weaken .
Trans@@ action volumes have mean@@ while dropped by a quarter year on year in London &apos;s most expensive post@@ codes , such as Ch@@ el@@ sea , May@@ fair and K@@ ens@@ ington , according to agent W@@ A El@@ lis .
Still , ap@@ peti@@ te for homes in the capital has been a bo@@ on to Ber@@ kel@@ ey , pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.@@ 2@@ b@@ n@@ .
Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley added : &quot; Dem@@ and for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained res@@ ili@@ ent and , reflecting this , forward sales have been maintained . &quot;
In June the company reported it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-@@ crisis peak in 2007 .
Annual pre-@@ tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 3@@ 80@@ m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.@@ 6@@ b@@ n@@ .
Spe@@ aking on Monday ahead of the company &apos;s annual meeting , Mr P@@ id@@ g@@ ley said Ber@@ kel@@ ey &apos;s earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations .
Analy@@ st consensus is for full-@@ year pre-@@ tax profit of £ 4@@ 50@@ m .
Ber@@ kel@@ ey shares were flat at £ 23.@@ 96 in afternoon London trading .
Nu@@ de photos of J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence le@@ aked online by h@@ ack@@ er
J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence arri@@ ves at the 8@@ 5th annual Academy Awards .
Nu@@ de photos of Os@@ car@@ -@@ winning act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence have been le@@ aked online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of 100 other star@@ lets .
A representative for the star of &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; confirmed the photos of La@@ wr@@ ence were real and bla@@ sted the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; a flag@@ rant violation of privacy . &quot;
The authorities have been cont@@ acted and will prosec@@ ute anyone who posts the st@@ olen photos of J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence .
The photos , which originally were posted on the ima@@ ge-@@ sharing site 4@@ ch@@ an , were pur@@ port@@ edly obtained through a weakness in Apple &apos;s i@@ Cl@@ oud online storage system , and a pur@@ port@@ ed &quot; master list &quot; of the h@@ acking victims includes the names of doz@@ ens of female stars , including R@@ ih@@ anna , Kim Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an , Mary Eli@@ zab@@ eth Win@@ stead and Mar@@ y-@@ K@@ ate Ol@@ sen , according to Bu@@ zz@@ F@@ eed .
It is not clear how many of the images are authentic , though &quot; Scott Pil@@ gri@@ m v@@ s. the World &quot; star Win@@ stead took to Twitter to den@@ ounce the h@@ ack as well .
&quot; To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home , hope you feel great about y@@ ourselves , &quot; Win@@ stead t@@ we@@ eted .

Exclu@@ sive extract from How@@ ard Jac@@ ob@@ son &apos;s acc@@ laimed new novel about love and the letter &apos; J@@ &apos;
They dis@@ solved , that was the best way of putting it , they gradually came apart like a card@@ board box that had been left out in the rain .
Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious , hard-@@ going , intense , det@@ ached , and maybe a bit pri@@ ck@@ ly .
And then sh@@ ook his hand .
He recognised pri@@ ck@@ ly .
He was sp@@ iny , like a h@@ ed@@ geh@@ og , yes .
The latest cas@@ u@@ alty of this sp@@ in@@ iness was an embry@@ o-@@ affair that had given greater promise than usual of rel@@ iev@@ ing the lon@@ ely te@@ dium of his life , and perhaps even bringing him some content .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons was a wil@@ d-@@ ha@@ ired , qui@@ ver@@ ingly delicate beauty with a fl@@ ut@@ tering heart from a northern island village more remote and rug@@ ged even than Port R@@ eu@@ ben .
She had come south with an older comp@@ an@@ ion whom K@@ ever@@ n took to be her a@@ unt , the latter having been left a property in a wet but para@@ dis@@ al valley called , fel@@ ic@@ it@@ ously , Par@@ adise Valley .
No one had lived in the house for several years .
The pi@@ pes le@@ aked , there were spi@@ ders still in the baths , s@@ lu@@ gs had signed their signatures on all the windows , believ@@ ing the place belong@@ ed to them , the garden was over@@ grown with we@@ eds that res@@ emb@@ led giant cab@@ b@@ ages .
It was like a children &apos;s story cot@@ tage , threatening and enchanting at the same time , the garden full of sec@@ rets .
Auth@@ or &apos;s view : How@@ ard Jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; J &quot; is lon@@ gli@@ sted for the Man Boo@@ ker Prize 2014 .
The short@@ list is announced next week
K@@ ever@@ n had been sitting holding hands with A@@ il@@ inn on broken deck@@ chairs in the long grass , enjoying an un@@ expect@@ edly warm spring afternoon , the pair of them ab@@ sent@@ -@@ min@@ de@@ dly plug@@ ged into the utility console that supplied the country with so@@ o@@ thing music and cal@@ ming news , when the sight of her cross@@ ed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-@@ forgotten black enter@@ tain@@ er his father had liked listening to with the cot@@ tage blin@@ ds down .
Your feet &apos;s too big .
On account of their inn@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of that sort were no longer played on the console .
Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played .
En@@ cour@@ aged to fall into des@@ u@@ et@@ ude , like the word des@@ u@@ et@@ ude .
Pop@@ ular taste did what e@@ dict and pro@@ scri@@ ption could never have done , and just as , when it came to books , the people chose ra@@ gs@@ -to-@@ ri@@ ches mem@@ o@@ irs , cook@@ books and roman@@ ces , so , when it came to music , they chose ball@@ ads .
Car@@ ried away by the day , K@@ ever@@ n began to play at an imag@@ inary piano and in a ru@@ d@@ ely com@@ ic voice ser@@ en@@ ade A@@ il@@ inn &apos;s big feet .
A@@ il@@ inn didn &apos;t understand .
&quot; It was a popular song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called F@@ ats W@@ aller , &quot; he told her , automatically putting two f@@ ing@@ ers to his li@@ ps .
This his father had always done to sti@@ f@@ le the letter j before it left his li@@ ps .
It had begun as a game between them when he was small .
His father had played it with his own father , he &apos;d told him .
Beg@@ in a word with a j without remember@@ ing to put two f@@ ing@@ ers across your mouth and it cost you a p@@ enny .
It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
He knew it was expected of him , that was all .
He had to explain what jazz was .
A@@ il@@ inn had never heard any .
Jazz , too , without exactly being pro@@ scri@@ bed , wasn &apos;t played .
Impro@@ vis@@ ation had fallen out of fashion .
There was room for only one &quot; if &quot; in life .
People wanted to be sure , when a tune began , exactly where it was going to end .
W@@ it , the same .
Its un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability uns@@ ett@@ led people &apos;s ner@@ ves .
And jazz was wi@@ t expressed musi@@ cally .
Though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Samm@@ y Dav@@ is Junior , K@@ ever@@ n knew of jazz from his father &apos;s semi-@@ secret collection of old CDs .
But at least he didn &apos;t have to tell A@@ il@@ inn that F@@ ats W@@ aller was black .
Given her age , she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular sing@@ ers weren &apos;t black .
Again , no laws or dur@@ ess .
A compli@@ ant society meant that every section of it cons@@ ented with gratitude - the gratitude of the provi@@ denti@@ ally spar@@ ed - to the principle of group ap@@ titude .
People of Af@@ ro-@@ Caribbean origin were suited by tem@@ per@@ ament and physi@@ que to entertainment and ath@@ le@@ tics , and so they s@@ ang and sprin@@ ted .
People originally from the Indian sub@@ continent , electron@@ ically gi@@ fted as though by nature , under@@ took to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
What was left of the Polish community pl@@ um@@ bed ; what was left of the Greek sm@@ ashed plates .
Those from the Gulf States and the Lev@@ ant whose grand@@ parents ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t quickly left the country while W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , IF IT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED was happening - fear@@ ing they &apos;d be accused of having st@@ oked the fl@@ ames , fear@@ ing , indeed , that the fl@@ ames would consu@@ me them next - opened lab@@ neh and sh@@ is@@ ha-@@ pipe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew de@@ pressed with id@@ l@@ eness .
To each according to his gifts .
Having heard only ball@@ ads , A@@ il@@ inn was hard pressed to understand how the ins@@ ul@@ ting words K@@ ever@@ n had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
Music was the expression of love .
&quot; They &apos;re not really ins@@ ul@@ ting , &quot; K@@ ever@@ n said .
Exc@@ ept maybe to people whose feet are too big .
My father never ins@@ ul@@ ted anybody , but he delighted in this song .
He was saying too much , but the garden &apos;s negl@@ ect gave the illu@@ sion of safety .
No word could get beyond the sound@@ proof@@ ing of the giant cab@@ ba@@ ge-@@ like leaves .
A@@ il@@ inn still didn &apos;t compreh@@ end .
Why would your father have loved something like that ?
He wanted to say it was a jo@@ ke , but was reluc@@ tant , in her company , to put two f@@ ing@@ ers to his li@@ ps again .
She already thought he was strange .
&quot; It struck him as f@@ unny , &quot; he said instead .
She sh@@ ook her head in dis@@ belief , bl@@ ot@@ ting out K@@ ever@@ n &apos;s vision .
Nothing to see in the whole wide world but her ha@@ yst@@ ack of crow@@ -@@ black hair .
Nothing else he wanted to see .
&quot; If you say so , &quot; she said , un@@ convinced .
But that still doesn &apos;t explain why you &apos;re singing it to me .
She seemed in genuine dist@@ ress .
Are my feet too big ?
He looked again .
Your feet specifically , no .
Your an@@ kl@@ es , maybe , a bit ...
And you say you h@@ ate me because my an@@ kl@@ es are too thick ?
H@@ ate you ?
Of course I don &apos;t h@@ ate you .
That &apos;s just the sil@@ ly song .
He could have said , &quot; I love you , &quot; but it was too soon for that .
&quot; Your thick an@@ kl@@ es are the very reason I &apos;m attracted to you , &quot; he tried instead .
I &apos;m per@@ verse that way .
It came out wrong .
He had meant it to be f@@ unny .
Mean@@ ing to be f@@ unny often land@@ ed him in a m@@ ess because , like his father , he lack@@ ed the re@@ ass@@ uring charm necessary to temp@@ er the cru@@ el@@ ty that l@@ ur@@ ked in j@@ ok@@ es .
Maybe his father intended to be cru@@ el .
Maybe he , K@@ ever@@ n , did .
Despite his kind eyes .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons flus@@ hed and rose from her deck@@ chair , kno@@ cking over the console and sp@@ illing the wine they &apos;d been drinking .
El@@ der@@ flower wine , so drink wasn &apos;t his excuse .
In her ag@@ itation she seemed to tre@@ m@@ ble , like the fron@@ ds of a pal@@ m tree in a storm .
&quot; And your thick head &apos;s the very reason I &apos;m per@@ ver@@ sely attracted to you , &quot; she said ...
Exc@@ ept that I &apos;m not .
He felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary unk@@ ind@@ ness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
Did she think he &apos;d strike her ?
She ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t spoken to him about life on the chill northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she had grown up , but he didn &apos;t doubt it was in all essenti@@ als similar to here .
The same vast and ic@@ y ocean cr@@ ashed in on them both .
The same befu@@ dd@@ led men , even more th@@ in-@@ sk@@ inn@@ ed and pe@@ ev@@ ish in the after@@ math of W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED than their smu@@ gg@@ ler and w@@ re@@ cker ancest@@ ors had been , ro@@ amed ang@@ ri@@ ly from pub to pub , ready to raise a hand to any woman who dar@@ ed to refuse or twi@@ t them .
Th@@ ick head ?
They &apos;d show her a thick f@@ ist , if she wasn &apos;t careful !
S@@ no@@ g her first - the s@@ no@@ g having become the most common expression of ero@@ tic ir@@ rit@@ ation between men and women ; an anti@@ do@@ te to the b@@ land ball@@ ads of love the console p@@ ump@@ ed out - s@@ no@@ g her first and cu@@ ff her later .
An unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement in K@@ ever@@ n &apos;s view , since a s@@ no@@ g was itself an act of th@@ ug@@ gery .
A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
He heav@@ ed himself out of the deck@@ chair like an old man .
She felt lea@@ den herself , but the weight of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
This wasn &apos;t the end of the world .
They barely knew each other .
She wat@@ ched him go - as at an up@@ stairs window her comp@@ an@@ ion wat@@ ched him go - a man made heavy by what he &apos;d brought on himself .
Adam leaving the garden , she thought .
She felt a p@@ ang for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
A man turned from her , his back b@@ ent , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , all the fight in him le@@ aked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she couldn &apos;t recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
Al@@ one again , A@@ il@@ inn Sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
A score or so years before the events related above , Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 3@@ 2-@@ year-old resear@@ cher employed by O@@ f@@ now , the non-@@ statutory monitor of the Public M@@ ood , prepared a short paper on the continu@@ ance of low@@ - and medium-@@ level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its c@@ ess@@ ation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy exp@@ ended on u@@ pro@@ oting it .
&quot; Much has been done , and much continues to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to so@@ o@@ the the native aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those twi@@ sted kn@@ ar@@ ls and narrow cre@@ vi@@ ces of the country where , though the sp@@ ires of churches so@@ ar above the h@@ ed@@ ger@@ ows , the swe@@ eter bre@@ ath of human kin@@ dness has , histor@@ ically , been rarely felt .
But some qualities are pro@@ ving to be iner@@ a@@ dic@@ able .
The higher the sp@@ ire , it would seem , the lower the pas@@ sions it goes on en@@ gen@@ dering .
The popul@@ ace we@@ eps to sen@@ tim@@ ental ball@@ ads , gor@@ ges on stories of ad@@ versity overcome , and prof@@ esses to believe ard@@ ently in the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but not only does the old bru@@ ti@@ sh@@ ness retain a per@@ tin@@ acious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vi@@ cious quar@@ rel@@ som@@ eness in the home , in the workplace , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
&quot; You have an unfortunate tendency to over@@ write , &quot; her super@@ vis@@ or said when he had read the whole report .
May I suggest you read fewer no@@ vels .
Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum lower@@ ed her head .
I must also en@@ qu@@ ire : are you an ath@@ ei@@ st ?
&quot; I believe I am not obliged to say , &quot; Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum rep@@ lied .
Are you a les@@ bian ?
Again Es@@ me prot@@ ested her right to privacy and silence .
A femin@@ ist ?
Sil@@ ence once more .
&quot; I don &apos;t ask , &quot; Lu@@ ther Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz said at last , &quot; because I have an obj@@ ection to ath@@ ei@@ sm , les@@ bi@@ anism or femin@@ ism .
This is a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free workplace .
We are the servants of a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free society .
But certain kinds of hyper@@ sensitivity , while entirely acceptable and lau@@ dable in themselves , may sometimes dist@@ ort findings such as you have presented to me .
You are obviously yourself prejudi@@ ced against the church ; and those things you call &quot; vi@@ cious &quot; and &quot; bru@@ tish , &quot; others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vig@@ our and vit@@ ality .
To still be har@@ ping on about W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , IF IT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to s@@ ap the country of its essential life force .
Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum looked around her while Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz spoke .
Beh@@ ind his head a fl@@ am@@ ingo p@@ ink LED sc@@ roll repeated the advice O@@ f@@ now had been disp@@ ens@@ ing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
Smi@@ le at your neigh@@ bour , cher@@ ish your sp@@ ouse , listen to ball@@ ads , go to musi@@ c@@ als , use your telephone , con@@ verse , explain , listen , agree , ap@@ olog@@ ise .
Tal@@ k is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; I fully understand the points you are making , &quot; Es@@ me N@@ uss@@ baum rep@@ lied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her super@@ vis@@ or had finished speaking , &quot; and I am saying no more than that we are not heal@@ ed as effectively as we del@@ ude ourselves we are .
My concern is that , if we are not for@@ e@@ warned , we will find ourselves repe@@ ating the mistakes that led to W@@ H@@ AT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , IF IT HA@@ PP@@ EN@@ ED , in the first place .
Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
Lu@@ ther Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz made a p@@ yr@@ amid of his f@@ ing@@ ers .
This was to suggest infin@@ ite pati@@ ence .
&quot; You go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; in descri@@ bing as &quot; mistakes &quot; actions which our grand@@ parents might or might not have taken .
You go too far , as well , in speaking of them v@@ enting their &quot; anger &quot; and &quot; mi@@ str@@ ust &quot; on &quot; others . &quot;
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
There was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others . &quot;
It was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know of it .
&quot; In which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; Es@@ me dar@@ ed to inter@@ ject , &quot; no section of society can claim to have acqu@@ itted itself well .
I make no accus@@ ations .
Whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
Then was then .
No more needs to be said - on this we agree .
And just as there is no blame to be ap@@ por@@ tioned , so there are no amend@@ s to be made , were amend@@ s appropriate and were there any way of making them .
But what is the past for if not to learn from it -
The past exists in order that we forget it .
If I may add one word to that -
Lu@@ ther Rab@@ ino@@ wi@@ tz collap@@ sed his p@@ yr@@ amid .
&quot; I will consider your report , &quot; he said , dis@@ missing her .
The next day , turning up for work as usual , she was kno@@ cked down by a motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ st who had mounted the p@@ av@@ ement in what p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by described as a &quot; vi@@ cious rage . &quot;
Co@@ inci@@ den@@ ces happen .
Les@@ oth@@ o military says no coup planned ; PM stays in South Africa
Les@@ oth@@ o military officials denied st@@ aging a coup to over@@ throw the government , saying they were acting against police susp@@ ected of trying to arm political fan@@ atics .
Prime Minister Thomas Th@@ ab@@ ane fl@@ ed the country , saying the country &apos;s military had surrounded his official home and sei@@ zed government buildings in the capital of Mas@@ er@@ u .
The premi@@ er took his family to neighbor@@ ing South Africa after saying he received an assass@@ ination threat .
Milit@@ ary spo@@ kes@@ man Major N@@ t@@ l@@ ele N@@ to@@ i said there was not , in fact , a coup , but that the military was responding to a threat from &quot; political fan@@ atics &quot; whom police were attempting to arm .
&quot; What happened this morning was that the command of the Les@@ oth@@ o Def@@ ense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fan@@ atics who were on the ver@@ ge of w@@ re@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c , &quot; he told Vo@@ ice of America .
South African government spo@@ kes@@ man C@@ lay@@ son Mon@@ y@@ ela said the military &apos;s actions had the appearance at an over@@ throw .
&quot; Although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the Les@@ oth@@ o defense force thus far bear the hall@@ marks of a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , &quot; he said .
Les@@ oth@@ o military officials said soldiers returned to their bar@@ ra@@ cks Sunday and there was calm in the capital .
Meanwhile , Dep@@ uty Prime Minister Mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ a Met@@ sing in control of the government in Th@@ ab@@ ane &apos;s absence .
Th@@ ab@@ ane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
Ten@@ sions have been high in Les@@ oth@@ o since June when Th@@ ab@@ ane suspended parliament sessions due to feu@@ ding in his unity government .
He said his actions have not undermined the government , despite alleg@@ ations otherwise .
Eurozone manufacturing at 13@@ -@@ month low
Manufac@@ turing growth in the eurozone slow@@ ed to a 13@@ -@@ month low in August , according to a clo@@ sel@@ y-@@ wat@@ ched survey .
The final Mark@@ it &apos;s Eurozone Manufac@@ turing Purch@@ asing Man@@ agers &apos; Index ( PM@@ I ) di@@ pped to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in August , down from 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in July .
A figure above 50 indicates expansion .
New orders d@@ wind@@ led and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine .
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) meeting on Thursday .
Mark@@ ets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a st@@ alled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of de@@ flation with inflation standing at just 0.@@ 3 % .
There is speculation that ECB bo@@ ss Mario Dra@@ g@@ hi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis .
&quot; Although some growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ king effect of rising economic and geopoli@@ tical un@@ certain@@ ties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , &quot; said R@@ ob D@@ ob@@ son , senior econom@@ ist at Mark@@ it .
The factory PM@@ I for Germany , Russia &apos;s biggest trade partner in the EU , fell to an 11-@@ month low of 5@@ 1.4 .
Meanwhile , in the blo@@ c &apos;s second-@@ largest economy , France , the PM@@ I fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
France remains a real concern , as does Italy &apos;s des@@ cent from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
Sign@@ s that growth impetus w@@ an@@ ed in the key industrial engine of Germany , and in Spain and the Netherlands too , is also less than re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; Mr D@@ ob@@ son said .
The slow@@ down in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for an@@ alyst@@ s expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented .
One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland , which saw its PM@@ I grow to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
How@@ ard Archer , chief econom@@ ist at I@@ HS Global In@@ sight , said : &quot; The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers &apos; survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . &quot;
He added : &quot; Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current hei@@ gh@@ tened geopoli@@ tical tensions - particularly related to Russia / Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
This hei@@ gh@@ tened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled , particularly big@@ -@@ ticket orders .
He said it was looking &quot; ever more likely &quot; that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of Q@@ E , &quot; although we suspect that it will be limited . &quot;
The Bes@@ lan survi@@ vors &apos; decade of hell : Ten years since the hor@@ rif@@ ic school si@@ ege , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken ho@@ stage by Ch@@ echen milit@@ ants at a school in Bes@@ lan , southern Russia
More than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day or@@ deal that sho@@ cked the world
We went back to Bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room atro@@ city
Ex@@ ac@@ tly a decade after the appalling Bes@@ lan school si@@ ege in which 3@@ 34 per@@ ished , including 18@@ 6 children , the hero@@ ic survi@@ vors warned last night of a new apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se in Ukraine .
When fan@@ atic Islamic terrorists kid@@ n@@ apped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the n@@ adi@@ r of all evil .
The tragedy united east and west in re@@ vul@@ sion , which amaz@@ ingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the di@@ rest mis@@ ery .
Ten years on , we went back to Bes@@ lan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room atro@@ city .
We discovered amazing young people , who have de@@ fied ad@@ versity , though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever .
Their greatest hope ?
That the war now scar@@ ring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
The girl pic@@ tured trying to climb back inside the bli@@ tz@@ ed school gym
She was fam@@ ously sn@@ apped by top Russian photographer D@@ mit@@ ry Bel@@ i@@ ak@@ ov wearing only her under@@ wear as tried to climb back inside the bli@@ tz@@ ed school gym after a mine explo@@ ded .
Be@@ wil@@ dered , A@@ ida was desper@@ ately searching for her mother , Lar@@ iss@@ a , now 40 .
Both were fear@@ ed dead , but in fact they survi@@ ved .
&apos;@@ A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn &apos;t , &apos; said A@@ ida at the time .
My legs were covered in blood .
I got up and clim@@ bed back in to look for my m@@ um .
A soldi@@ er plu@@ cked her to safety .
After a series of sur@@ geri@@ es , she thought she had totally recover@@ ed but said yesterday : &apos; Three months ago , the pain came back .
I fear I may need more surgery .
Some sh@@ rap@@ nel pieces are still in my kne@@ e .
Her aim now is to become a denti@@ st , to help people as she has been ai@@ ded by medi@@ cs .
&apos;@@ This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , &apos; she said de@@ fi@@ antly .
&apos;@@ It happened to me and you can &apos;t change this fact .
Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there .
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days .
The pain is too much .
My best friend and my class@@ mat@@ e-@@ to-@@ be D@@ z@@ era Ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
We played together when we were small and dre@@ amed of going to school together .
&apos;@@ I don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until I finish my studies and start my career .
I will think about a family later .
She says the si@@ ege remains with her though memories fa@@ de a little each year .
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troub@@ les and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere .
When I see online the phot@@ ograph of me climbing into the school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
The boy who fl@@ ed through a ha@@ il of bul@@ lets believ@@ ing his mother to be dead
He was on his first day at school ( Russians start school aged 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three day si@@ ege hu@@ gging his m@@ um Tam@@ ara .
Then seven he said : &apos; M@@ um@@ my told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand . &apos;
After one explosion he thought she was dying .
She told him : &apos; R@@ un &apos; .
F@@ ear@@ ing she was dead , he fl@@ ed and on his way he saw a cr@@ ying to@@ dd@@ ler , grab@@ bed the child by the hand , and fl@@ ed through a ha@@ il of bul@@ lets .
His dad V@@ ladimir , who s@@ co@@ op@@ ed up his son outside , said : &apos; Dam@@ ir told me his mother had died .
He said : &apos; I couldn &apos;t save her &apos; . &apos;
In fact , Tam@@ ara had st@@ umb@@ led free and was in hospital with leg wo@@ unds , in turn believ@@ ing her son had per@@ ished .
After their re@@ union she said : &apos; I w@@ ept with joy .
I couldn &apos;t believe it .
He ran in and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
Dam@@ ir was later f@@ lown to London ( by the now de@@ func@@ t News of the World newspaper ) to be crow@@ ned a Bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s Children &apos;s Champion by then premi@@ er Tony Blair and wife wife Cher@@ ie .
&apos;@@ This hor@@ ror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop rec@@ alling it , &apos; he said yesterday .
Still I can say that in my mind it is f@@ ading .
I remember right afterwards , I thre@@ w away all my to@@ y g@@ uns .
But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me .
&apos;@@ I &apos;m not scar@@ ed to go back in the gym but I don &apos;t think about myself .
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out .
We never say they were killed or dead .
We say they stayed in the gym .
I remember my trip to London so well , specially the to@@ y shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted , and riding in an open top car .
But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of mis@@ ery he and his friends suffered .
This hor@@ ror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop rec@@ alling it
&apos;@@ I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these hor@@ rors , &apos; said Dam@@ ir , who was last week doing voluntary work at a n@@ unn@@ ery .
I want to help so much .
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they en@@ rol me to the training ac@@ ade@@ my next year .
His mother Tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &apos; 37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
I remember terrible silence right after the si@@ ege , there were just no children to sh@@ out and run around , and that silence la@@ sted for many months .
She vivi@@ dly rec@@ alls her trip with Dam@@ ir to London .
People in London were cr@@ ying when I told our story .
I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings , can show their support .
She was grateful to &apos; Cher@@ ie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004 .
I wish I could call Cher@@ ie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London , and how that helped Dam@@ ir and me .
I remember when Dam@@ ir wanted to eat bor@@ sch sou@@ p , they called all the local Russian restaurants .
I remember how he was playing with wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , Dam@@ ir was shooting at them from his water pist@@ ol and they ran away and played with him .
And we were just one month away from our hor@@ ror then .
I was amaz@@ ed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
She said : &apos; I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
Now in Ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and I believe many children were killed and will be killed .
They are just the same children , like ours .
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bor@@ ed or busy with something else .
I just know what those people feel , the hor@@ ror of it .
And I can &apos;t stop feeling it .
Nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
Dam@@ ir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy , he is not at all aggressive or an@@ gr@@ y .
He is not seeking re@@ ven@@ ge for example , he is not pre@@ occupied with this past hor@@ ror .
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six class@@ m@@ ates and they go to the gym from time to time and light cand@@ les there .
When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
Not sleeping , his eyes were open .
I also remember how he thre@@ w away all his g@@ uns and other arm@@ y-@@ type to@@ ys@@ .@@ Dam@@ ir is 17 now , t@@ aller than me , nice looking , cle@@ ver and healthy .
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I &apos;d never see him again .
When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around , I saw the hell around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survi@@ ved in this hell .
&apos;@@ I remember I was sh@@ ou@@ ting to him &apos; Dam@@ ir , run , run away &apos; but again I was so sure he had not heard me .
But he did hear , and he did run away .
So life goes on for us unlike for so many .
Geor@@ gy I@@ ly@@ in , 17
The boy whose sho@@ cking image after the si@@ ege came to define the hor@@ ror of Bes@@ lan
Comfort : Bes@@ lan survi@@ vor Geor@@ gy I@@ ly@@ in with his m@@ um F@@ ati@@ ma after the si@@ ege in 2004 , while on the right is Geor@@ gy today
His bloo@@ d@@ stained face was et@@ ched with fear as he ran for his life as Ch@@ echen terrorists g@@ un@@ ned down his class@@ m@@ ates .
His picture was one of the most sho@@ cking symbols of the barbar@@ ity at Bes@@ lan .
His mother F@@ ati@@ ma , 54 , a senior GP , had dropped him for his first day at school before rus@@ hing to take her el@@ der son V@@ ladimir to university .
&apos;@@ I left two minutes before the terrorists rus@@ hed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of hor@@ ror , &apos; she rec@@ alled .
Not completely alone , we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed .
Only my Geor@@ gy managed to survive .
The closer this date is , the harder it is to think and talk about it .
There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
We do not feel it was long ago , I think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
Nob@@ ody will ever forget , I promise you .
Ha@@ unting : The image of Geor@@ gy ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and has been im@@ mort@@ alised in a stat@@ ue ( right )
I remember Geor@@ gy so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV .
And now there is even a stat@@ ue to cr@@ ying Geor@@ gy in San Mar@@ ino .
Geor@@ gy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the book@@ case in our home .
I understand , but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
Geor@@ gy says now : &apos; It &apos;s important this can never happen again .
&apos;@@ I doubt we &apos;ll ever know the truth .
People keep investig@@ ating such trage@@ dies and never know the truth .
Now they are investig@@ ating this Bo@@ eing crash in Ukraine .
Will we ever know what caused it ?
This world is moving to something very bad .
&apos;@@ I can &apos;t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-@@ one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
Ten years is nothing for such pain .
We need doz@@ ens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
It affected my health and I still feel it .
For about three or four years I had some night@@ mar@@ es because of the si@@ ege but then it got better .
I got back to school later in 2004 , I was very scar@@ ed every day .
I was thinking about my friends and class@@ m@@ ates who were killed .
This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches .
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it .
I do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself .
My life goes on .
I finished school this year entered a medical university in V@@ ladi@@ k@@ av@@ ka@@ z .
I will learn to be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
My first choice was to go in the army .
I wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .
Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ y@@ ev , 20
The boy who survi@@ ved despite having been tra@@ pped at the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist
Mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous : Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ y@@ ev was tra@@ pped at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist during the si@@ ege but still managed to survive
As the si@@ ege was under@@ way , he was pic@@ tured tra@@ pped inside the gym , sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
It is truly a mi@@ racle he was not killed .
&apos;@@ We feel as if it was just yesterday , &apos; said Geor@@ gy , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FS@@ B , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the si@@ ege .
It is still with me , this is not something I left behind .
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true .
&apos;@@ In 2006 I worked with psych@@ ologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can &apos;t forget it .
And I would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again .
I lost consciousness .
I would never ever go there again and please don &apos;t ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture .
Sur@@ vi@@ vor : Geor@@ gy Far@@ ni@@ ev pic@@ tured today , with a phot@@ ograph of him in hospital f@@ oll@@ wo@@ ing the si@@ ege on his laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day .
My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
In terms of physical condition I am well .
I should be careful with my kne@@ e which was injured but I walk fine now .
Still my health did not let me go and study in FS@@ B secret service ac@@ ade@@ my in St Petersburg as I wanted .
I sent my documents , including medical papers , and they rep@@ lied it was not possible .
My second passion was animals , so I went to the veter@@ inary institute .
I have completed two years there .
He is learning to treat all animals &apos; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &apos; .
He said : &apos; I know I would never tell my children about my experience .
This is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
His mother Marina , 42 , said : &apos; This pain never leaves me .
It is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
I will go and attend cerem@@ on@@ ies being held to mark it .
I know Geor@@ gy won &apos;t go .
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not .
I was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me@@ .@@ Here in Bes@@ lan the im@@ print is on everyone .
It stays with us .
Geor@@ gy is an adult now but that hor@@ ror is still with him .
It is hard to accept it when something so terri@@ bly unfair happens to you .
He is a boy , he likes sports but he can &apos;t take part because of his kne@@ e .
He had several sur@@ geri@@ es , he walks but cannot exercise .
I would say he 50 % over@@ came this hor@@ ror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
This hor@@ ri@@ ble experience will stay with us .
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the si@@ ege , and it only adds to my pain .
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me .
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
I know families where new children were born , but also wid@@ ows who never married again .
It is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
I will never forget my heart j@@ umping out of my ch@@ est at the moment I saw him in hospital .
Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
What are those people fighting for ?
Why are they killing each other ?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it .
We used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
People and children are suffering , I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed .
If we could only gr@@ ab all the re@@ bels and throw them away - as far away as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and video
If you &apos;re interested in shooting photos or video under@@ water , you have a variety of equipment choices .
The che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof point@@ -and-@@ shoot , such as the Nikon Co@@ ol@@ pi@@ x A@@ W@@ 120 or an action cam , such as the Go@@ Pro Her@@ o@@ 3 + Silver Edition , which both go for around $ 300 .
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all priced under $ 350 .
No matter what gear you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
Dou@@ b@@ le-@@ check your gear .
Even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the camera &apos;s battery and other com@@ partments are tigh@@ tly closed .
Also , set your camera to match the type of photos or video you &apos;ll be shooting .
Some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for di@@ m under@@ sea settings .
And before you jump in , know how deep your equipment can go .
Some cameras are rated to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
Check out our buying guide and Rat@@ ings for digital cameras for both conventional and water@@ proof models .
Take multiple shots - because many of them won &apos;t work .
Po@@ int-@@ and-@@ shoot cameras have L@@ CDs to help you com@@ pose photos , while action cam@@ s generally don &apos;t .
Even if you have an LCD , it &apos;s going to hard to see it under@@ water , and com@@ posing your shot will be a h@@ it-@@ or-@@ miss process .
So shoot multi@@ ples .
Also , if your camera has a bra@@ cket mode , which sho@@ ots a bur@@ st of shots at slightly different exposure settings , take advantage of it .
Stay near the surface .
Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive under@@ water .
If possible , stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool , a lake or the ocean .
This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you &apos;ll see .
Get close to your subjects .
This is great advice for shooting on dry land , but it is even more important under@@ water because of the di@@ m lighting conditions .
It &apos;s particularly important if you &apos;re shooting with an action cam : These devices often have a fixed , wide angle lens , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
Andrew La@@ w@@ son was the kind of man whose force of personality could sha@@ ke things up , even in a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an organisation like the N@@ HS .
A consult@@ ant an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ st , he devoted his career to spar@@ ing the sick both the agon@@ ies of illness and the tor@@ ments of treatment .
Among those who sought him out , his wife rem@@ embers , was an MI@@ 6 officer who had to live with the cri@@ p@@ pling after@@ -@@ effects of torture .
La@@ w@@ son understood that while doctors are cap@@ tiv@@ ated by diagno@@ ses and diseases , those being treated are overwhel@@ m@@ ingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
One day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
&quot; I have not felt myself , &quot; he wrote in May that year .
I &apos;ve had difficulty in energ@@ ising myself .
Stru@@ ggling with flu@@ -@@ like symptoms , he found himself imp@@ ati@@ ently ber@@ ating his wife , Juli@@ et .
&quot; I want everything to happen sooner rather than later , &quot; he noted .
When Juli@@ et went away on business for a week , La@@ w@@ son found himself un@@ usually , and un@@ accoun@@ t@@ ably , up@@ set .
Some@@ thing was up .
He got a colleague to perform a ch@@ est X-@@ ray .
Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps .
The results of the X-@@ ray came back .
He had mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , an inc@@ ur@@ able cancer that affects the ple@@ ura , or lining of the lung .
With most canc@@ ers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
Though some smo@@ kers get lung cancer , for example , not all lung cancer suff@@ er@@ ers have smo@@ ked .
But mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is different .
In almost every case , the cause is exposure to as@@ best@@ os - a fi@@ bro@@ us building material once du@@ b@@ bed &quot; mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; but now known to be mort@@ ally dangerous .
For most of us , mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma has been an easy disease to ignore .
As@@ best@@ os , after all , is a product of the past .
The most dangerous type of as@@ best@@ os has not been used in Britain since the 196@@ 0s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
Even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe lag@@ gers , buil@@ ders , car@@ p@@ enters and ship@@ yard workers , for example .
An industrial tox@@ in from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
But such compl@@ ac@@ ency is mis@@ placed .
Britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma epide@@ mic .
There are more mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
With an annual toll of about 2,@@ 500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma annual deaths since 1980 and proj@@ ected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason that we are feeling its de@@ adly effects now is that , though as@@ best@@ os use has been illegal for years ( all types of as@@ best@@ os were eventually banned by law in 1999 ) , it usually takes decades for mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma to develop .
And the mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma s@@ cour@@ ge is not confined to veter@@ ans of industrial building jobs .
As@@ best@@ os has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educated in , and the stores we shop in .
As a result , mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is no resp@@ ec@@ ter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
The bas@@ tions of privilege , from smart London department stores to public schools , have proved no refuge .
The H@@ ouses of Parliament are ri@@ dd@@ led with as@@ best@@ os .
Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reser@@ vo@@ irs of this de@@ adly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
Andrew La@@ w@@ son was not old .
Nor was he a pipe lag@@ ger .
In fact , he stru@@ gg@@ led to think where he might have come into contact with as@@ best@@ os .
Then he put his finger on it .
&quot; It seems that there may have been a lot of as@@ best@@ os in the t@@ unnels at Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital where I spent six years training , &quot; he wrote .
Every@@ body - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and por@@ ters - used the t@@ unnels .
One wonder@@ s how many of my contem@@ por@@ aries will get the same disease ?
It was a question to which , s@@ adly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
&quot; Of four doctors who trained at Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital and who subsequently developed mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma in the past five years , &quot; he noted in a letter in 2010 , &quot; I am the only one left alive . &quot;
How many of us will get this disease ?
Andrew La@@ w@@ son was diagno@@ sed with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma when he was 48 .
When he died , on February 17 this year , he was 55 .
To survive so long is unusual .
Fif@@ ty per cent of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers are dead 8 months after diagnosis .
It is always fat@@ al .
So now we can only echo La@@ w@@ son &apos;s question : &quot; How many of us will get the same disease ? &quot;
According to Britain &apos;s leading expert on mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , Professor Juli@@ an Pe@@ to , our best gu@@ ess is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the as@@ best@@ os epide@@ mic in Britain should have played itself out , some 90@@ ,000 people will have died .
Most currently have no idea that they will die this way .
An as@@ best@@ os mine in Qu@@ eb@@ ec , Canada Al@@ am@@ y
A quick gl@@ ance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma has spread .
This June , for example , Mark@@ s &amp; Sp@@ enc@@ er admitted neg@@ lig@@ ently ex@@ posing J@@ ani@@ ce Al@@ len to as@@ best@@ os .
She worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , super@@ vising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flag@@ ship store on Oxford Street .
Mrs Al@@ len was only 18 when she started working at M &amp; S.
Now she has two children in their 20@@ s .
&quot; Before this happened , &quot; she says , &quot; I had never heard of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , I barely knew about as@@ best@@ os .
I never would have dre@@ amed that I would be affected by it .
Fe@@ w people do know much about as@@ best@@ os .
In fact , as@@ best@@ os describes not one substance but a group of six miner@@ als .
They get their name from the word &quot; as@@ besti@@ form &quot; - which describes the fi@@ bro@@ us structure which end@@ ows them with strength and flexibility .
Of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
Chr@@ y@@ so@@ tile , commonly known as White As@@ best@@ os , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
It was used in roof@@ ing panels , floor tiles , pipe ins@@ ulation , bo@@ iler se@@ als , even bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
It is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ best@@ os , but it &apos;s still considered a &quot; major health haz@@ ard &quot; that can kill by the EU and WHO .
More dangerous , however , are Brown As@@ best@@ os ( am@@ o@@ site ) and Blue As@@ best@@ os ( cro@@ ci@@ do@@ li@@ te ) .
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest impor@@ ter of Brown As@@ best@@ os , and experts suggest that &quot; there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniqu@@ ely high mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma rate &#91; in the UK &#93; . &quot;
A Mark@@ s &amp; Sp@@ enc@@ er employee was exposed to as@@ best@@ os at its flag@@ ship store in Oxford Street , London Al@@ am@@ y
J@@ ani@@ ce Al@@ len may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , but Juli@@ an Pe@@ to &apos;s work suggests that her story is far from un@@ common .
He has produced a study of suff@@ er@@ ers which suggests that &quot; a substantial proportion of mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ omas with no known occup@@ ational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental as@@ best@@ os exposure . &quot;
Much of that exposure , he says , is due to &quot; normal occupation and we@@ a@@ ther@@ ing &quot; of our buildings .
No one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
A report from Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d Consulting , which looked at the Palace of West@@ min@@ ster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed un@@ awar@@ es .
In 2009 Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d reported that service s@@ haf@@ ts and pi@@ ping duc@@ ts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contam@@ inated with as@@ best@@ os , whose le@@ th@@ al fi@@ bres could be distur@@ bed by something as inno@@ cu@@ ous as &quot; strong curr@@ ents of air . &quot;
MP@@ s are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
While the Parliamentary Works Services Direc@@ torate insi@@ sted that the Palace of West@@ min@@ ster had been given &quot; a clean bill of health , &quot; it is now accepted £ 1@@ b@@ n of work lasting several years is required to over@@ hau@@ l Parliament , upgra@@ ding electri@@ cs and removing as@@ best@@ os , and that after the 2015 general election MP@@ s may sit in the nearby Q@@ E@@ 2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Ben@@ ches at West@@ min@@ ster .
The Go@@ d@@ dar@@ d report noted that &quot; the presence of as@@ best@@ os has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . &quot;
It is impossible to know if this mis@@ management will cost lives .
All anyone can do now is wait .
One person who has never been able to pin@@ point his exposure to as@@ best@@ os is Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t , a GP .
Like Andrew La@@ w@@ son , Ab@@ bot@@ t , 50 , susp@@ ects that he was exposed to as@@ best@@ os while working in hospitals .
&quot; I have worked at a hospital where positive as@@ best@@ os claims have been made , &quot; he says , &quot; But I can &apos;t prove it in my case .
It &apos;s so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
What he rem@@ embers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a f@@ ever .
He was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening surgery .
Su@@ ddenly I started feeling shi@@ very .
It came on very quickly .
I felt d@@ read@@ ful .
I didn &apos;t think I was going to be able to drive all the way home .
Being a doctor , Ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was coming from the ple@@ ura , the lining around his l@@ ungs .
But like J@@ ani@@ ce Al@@ len , he simply had no reason to suspect mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
He ended up spending a month off work .
Pu@@ zz@@ led doctors gave him ch@@ est X-@@ rays , and administ@@ ered ple@@ ural c@@ ath@@ eters to draw off flu@@ id from the l@@ ungs and send it for assessment .
Yet the condition went un@@ diagno@@ sed .
S@@ low@@ ly his health improved and he went back to work .
But from time to time the same symptoms returned , often after he took exercise and was brea@@ thing hard .
In 2011 , one of Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s patients arrived at his GP &apos;s surgery with similar symptoms to him , and was subsequently diagno@@ sed with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
But even then Ab@@ bot@@ t didn &apos;t make the connection with his own case .
After all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly as@@ best@@ os .
The link in that case was clear .
In September 2011 , Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s condition wor@@ sen@@ ed again , and his consult@@ ant took his C@@ T sc@@ ans and X-@@ rays to a panel of experts .
In December 2011 , exactly two years after Ab@@ bot@@ t started feeling un@@ well , a probe , equipped with a camera , was fed into the c@@ av@@ ity between the lining of his ch@@ est and the lining of his lung .
I &apos;m an optim@@ ist .
I tend just to p@@ lo@@ d along , &quot; he says .
I ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t worried about it too much to be honest .
But R@@ ach@@ el , my wife , was worrying .
The result of the bi@@ op@@ sy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : &quot; I was told it was mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma . &quot;
Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sed with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma
Su@@ ddenly Ab@@ bot@@ t was pl@@ ung@@ ed into meetings with Mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer .
That was when he realised the scale of the epide@@ mic .
&quot; It turns out that as@@ best@@ os was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had as@@ best@@ os lag@@ ging on the pi@@ pes , &quot; he says .
People who were exposed to as@@ best@@ os in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
So mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is now affecting younger people not in the typical profes@@ sions .
The most dangerous as@@ best@@ o@@ s-@@ lag@@ ged pi@@ pes in hospitals were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
But many staff , walking in pedestrian t@@ unnels to get from one building to another ( like Andrew La@@ w@@ son ) , or eating in bas@@ ement cant@@ e@@ ens ( as Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t frequently did ) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance .
For several decades after the war , it turns out , hospitals were potentially life-@@ saving places for patients , but life-@@ threatening places for the doctors who treated them .
It is still being removed today .
P@@ up@@ ils per@@ ched their B@@ un@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ best@@ os mat@@ s
And it is not just hospitals .
As@@ best@@ os was frequently used in offices , shops , libraries and town halls for its marvell@@ ous ins@@ ulating and fl@@ am@@ e-@@ retar@@ ding properties .
Scho@@ ols too .
In fact many people will have been first exposed to as@@ best@@ os in the class@@ room .
Up and down the country , in my@@ ri@@ ad chem@@ istry lessons , pupils have per@@ ched their B@@ un@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ best@@ os mat@@ s .
Websites have sprung up to address the issue of as@@ best@@ os in schools .
Meanwhile , in our homes , items as inno@@ cu@@ ous as floor tiles or shed ro@@ ofs have rout@@ inely contained as@@ best@@ os .
&quot; It &apos;s an industrial po@@ ison built into large amounts of our housing stock , &quot; notes Andrew Morgan , the lawyer who represented Andrew La@@ w@@ son in his case against Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital .
In one case the only contact the woman suff@@ erer could think of was pul@@ ling down a garden shed in the 1970s .
So be careful how you pull down the garden shed .
The impact of diagnosis , knowing that the disease is inc@@ ur@@ able , is huge .
&quot; It takes a while to s@@ ink in , &quot; says Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t .
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn &apos;t concentrate on what I was doing .
I was at the surgery for two weeks .
Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out .
Well , I won &apos;t see Christmas again
One of the har@@ dest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
Like countless patients before him , he rem@@ embers feeling be@@ wil@@ dered by the amount of information to get to gri@@ ps with .
&quot; It was hard to take everything in , &quot; he says .
&quot; I asked my consult@@ ant &quot; How long do I have ? &quot;
I was quoted about 12 months .
I remember thinking &quot; Well , I won &apos;t see Christmas again .
That &apos;s it . &quot; &quot;
Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma is particularly per@@ ni@@ cious , because it is the mechan@@ ics of how we stay alive - the very act of brea@@ thing - that causes the cancer that k@@ ills .
Most Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma cases are caused by exposure to as@@ best@@ os .
As@@ best@@ os is made up of tiny fi@@ bres .
When the as@@ best@@ os is distur@@ bed and the fi@@ bres are inhal@@ ed , they can become embedded in the ple@@ ura , the lining of the l@@ ungs .
As@@ best@@ os fi@@ bres ir@@ rit@@ ate the ple@@ ura and can cause cell mut@@ ations .
&quot; The problem comes from inhal@@ ed need@@ le-@@ shaped fi@@ bres of as@@ best@@ os , &quot; Professor Tom Treas@@ ure , a car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on who moved in 2001 to Gu@@ y &apos;s Hospital .
The very hospital where Andrew La@@ w@@ son susp@@ ected he was exposed to as@@ best@@ os is now , ir@@ on@@ ically , a leading centre in treating mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
Treas@@ ure knew La@@ w@@ son , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
Once the as@@ best@@ os need@@ les get into the lung tissue , says Treas@@ ure , &quot; the act of brea@@ thing pus@@ hes them on the peripher@@ y , which is where the lining is .
It is by its nature inv@@ asi@@ ve from the very beginning .
The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma .
The effectiveness of surgery , for example , is hot@@ ly debated .
Some feel it is worth trying .
Treas@@ ure dis@@ agrees .
&quot; You can &apos;t exc@@ ise the ple@@ ura , &quot; he says .
You can &apos;t get your kni@@ fe round it .
Meanwhile the cancer &quot; is not very respon@@ sive to chem@@ o@@ therapy , &quot; which &quot; has an effect &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; Every now and again you get long survi@@ vors , &quot; says Treas@@ ure .
But in the end they all die .
Happ@@ ily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
The author Stephen J@@ ay G@@ ould died 20 years after diagnosis .
Tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years after his own diagnosis , Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t is still batt@@ ling on .
After cont@@ acting mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma Ab@@ bot@@ t was put in touch with Andrew La@@ w@@ son , who , four years after his diagnosis , had become a one-@@ man support and advice bur@@ eau for fellow suff@@ er@@ ers .
&quot; H@@ ello , Canc@@ er Central , &quot; he would announce che@@ eri@@ ly when they called .
&quot; He was very positive , &quot; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
He had been diagno@@ sed 4 years before and was still very active .
Initi@@ ally , Ab@@ bot@@ t had been offered six cycles of chem@@ o@@ therapy that would take four months , and likely pro@@ long his life by just one month .
&quot; I felt desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
I felt like giving up .
La@@ w@@ son , however , &quot; managed to put a slightly better t@@ int on things . &quot;
After seeing several consultants , Ab@@ bot@@ t decided to pursue his treatment with Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ d@@ uns@@ ki , professor in thor@@ ac@@ ic surgery at Gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; We had an advantage in that I didn &apos;t have to be referred , I just rang them up and they saw me , &quot; Gra@@ ham ad@@ mits .
The average patient would have to get a refer@@ ral and have funding approved .
Money is crucial for those with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma to pursue the best available treatments .
But when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many suff@@ er@@ ers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation .
Andrew La@@ w@@ son cont@@ acted Andrew Morgan , from F@@ ield Fis@@ her Water@@ house LL@@ P .
&quot; It has been known that as@@ best@@ os is no@@ x@@ ious to health since 18@@ 98 , &quot; says Morgan .
But what changed in the 196@@ 0s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
That is where company negligence came in .
Andrew La@@ w@@ son and Gu@@ y &apos;s hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what Morgan calls a &quot; full-@@ value settlement &quot; since La@@ w@@ son could not prove defini@@ tively that his mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was down to as@@ best@@ os exposure at Gu@@ y &apos;s .
After the in@@ quest into his death , a spo@@ kes@@ man for Gu@@ y &apos;s did confirm , however , that &quot; the as@@ best@@ os in the bas@@ ement area concerned was removed in the 1990s . &quot;
That was too late for Andrew La@@ w@@ son .
How to remove as@@ best@@ os
In fact , p@@ inning le@@ th@@ al as@@ best@@ os exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers seeking compensation .
Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
In@@ surance records may have been lost .
And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the claim@@ ants certainly do not .
In response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be tra@@ ced .
The law has created a £ 3@@ 50@@ m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagno@@ sed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue .
In these cases suff@@ er@@ ers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 120@@ ,000 .
About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
Andrew Morgan , like many involved with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers , thinks that £ 3@@ 50@@ m represents &quot; a very good job &quot; for the insurance industry .
&quot; It &apos;s a deal written by ins@@ ur@@ ers for ins@@ ur@@ ers &quot; he says , suggest@@ ing that the sum is a quarter of what ins@@ ur@@ ers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not interven@@ ed , and mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma suff@@ er@@ ers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way .
Even Mike P@@ enn@@ ing , then Works and Pen@@ sions minister , admitted that the law was &quot; not perfect . &quot;
But both P@@ enn@@ ing and Morgan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
&quot; People are suffering so much , and need help today , &quot; said P@@ enn@@ ing during the Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma Bill &apos;s second reading in December last year .
By then , Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of Pro@@ f Lo@@ ic Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ d@@ uns@@ ki for 19 months .
After their initial consultations , Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ d@@ uns@@ ki advised surgery which , in contrast to Tom Treas@@ ure , he believes has a positive effect .
This was followed by radio@@ therapy and chem@@ o@@ therapy - a tri@@ -@@ therapy for which Lang@@ -L@@ az@@ d@@ uns@@ ki can bo@@ ast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
Ab@@ bot@@ t felt em@@ powered .
&quot; That of course is one of the most important things , &quot; says Ab@@ bot@@ t .
You see it in patients all the time .
There is some drive that keeps you going .
When you give up you can deterior@@ ate very quickly .
Gra@@ ham Ab@@ bot@@ t went in for surgery in March 2012 .
By the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chem@@ o@@ therapy .
Fol@@ low@@ -up sc@@ ans revealed no sign of the disease .
Then I had my scan in March &#91; 2014 &#93; .
There was multiple spot@@ ting &#91; of cancer &#93; around my ch@@ est .
I was just about to turn 50 .
It &apos;s not life threatening .
It &apos;s life ending .
Once again Ab@@ bot@@ t put himself through six cycles of chem@@ o@@ therapy .
Now there is no sign of the tu@@ mo@@ urs .
But the process is both physi@@ cally and emo@@ tionally gru@@ elling .
You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I &apos;m gone for example , or showing my wife how the bo@@ iler tim@@ er works .
When you get bad news you start getting negative .
You have to look forward .
As the father of El@@ lie , 16 , and Tam@@ sin , 14 , that is not always easy .
&quot; It &apos;s hard as a parent , &quot; he says .
It is difficult to know what to say and how much to say .
When I was first diagno@@ sed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn &apos;t going to become old .
They re@@ acted very differently .
Tam@@ sin is very soci@@ able and bo@@ ist@@ erous .
She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly .
El@@ lie was more reserved .
She didn &apos;t say much .
Such convers@@ ations are something that all cancer patients must face .

China ref@@ uses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders ; protes@@ ters v@@ ow ven@@ ge@@ ance
China &apos;s parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nomin@@ ate candidates for the 20@@ 17 election , despite growing ag@@ itation for democratic reform .
The move is likely to spark long-@@ promised protests in Hong Kong &apos;s business district , as activists began planning and mobili@@ zing within hours of the announcement .
The decision by China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to we@@ ed out any candidates not loy@@ al to Beijing .
&quot; It &apos;s not unexpected , but it is still in@@ fur@@ i@@ ating , &quot; said legislat@@ or E@@ mi@@ ly L@@ au , chair@@ woman of the Democratic Party .
This is not what Beijing promised .
They &apos;ve lied to the people of Hong Kong .
And it &apos;s clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
Def@@ ending China &apos;s ruling , L@@ i F@@ ei , dep@@ uty secret@@ ary general of the Stand@@ ing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress , said allowing public nom@@ inations in the election for Hong Kong &apos;s leader would be too &quot; cha@@ otic . &quot;
Since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing had promised to allow the region &apos;s residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 20@@ 17 .
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic break@@ through because it gives Hong Kon@@ gers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nomin@@ ating committee tigh@@ tly controlled by Beijing .
And , according to a new clause , only candidates who &quot; love the country , and love Hong Kong &quot; would be allowed .
The ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-@@ profile protests in Hong Kong in years .
Beh@@ ind much of the pro-@@ democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Central With Love and Peace movement , whose organiz@@ ers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suff@@ rage .
On Sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Central supporters had assemb@@ led in the rain outside the Hong Kong government &apos;s headquarters .
At the demonstration , organiz@@ ers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks .
However , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
In an online statement , organiz@@ ers said the movement &quot; has considered occup@@ ying Central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhau@@ sted and there is no other choice .
We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhau@@ sted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen .
Auth@@ orities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing &apos;s announcement for days , and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters , with police and barri@@ ca@@ des deployed .
Dri@@ ving the un@@ rest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
An influ@@ x of main@@ l@@ anders is fu@@ eling competition for products and services .
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing .
Some have critici@@ zed the O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Central movement , saying its demonstrations put business - the li@@ f@@ eb@@ lood of Hong Kong - at risk .
&quot; The protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , &quot; said legislat@@ or Reg@@ ina I@@ p , who has long critici@@ zed the movement .
We don &apos;t want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control .
This is a perception that is bad for investment .
China &apos;s state-@@ run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong &apos;s democracy activists as agents of sub@@ version directed by Western powers .
This summer , activists organized an un@@ official referendum on voting rights that drew 7@@ 80@@ ,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters .
And in July , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-@@ democracy demonstrations in the region &apos;s history .
US pro@@ m culture h@@ its university life with fresh@@ ers offered private jet entran@@ ces
We &apos;re exc@@ ited to be answer@@ ing this demand by launching the UK &apos;s first luxurious travel service for the students of today .
To make the maximum impact arriving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce Ph@@ an@@ tom , A@@ ston Martin or Mc@@ L@@ aren P@@ 1 .
Mr Ste@@ wart also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
The service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to hau@@ l their belong@@ ings across the country in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
P@@ ai@@ red with our new VI@@ F options , we &apos;re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum f@@ uss and maximum luxury .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that &quot; students will be booking the service over the next few weeks . &quot;
The company also said that despite students facing tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
Stu@@ dents of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it &apos;s more important than ever to make a great first impression and VI@@ F is just the way to do that .
However , the National Union of Stu@@ dents criticised the service as out of touch .
Meg@@ an Dun@@ n , N@@ US vice president for higher education , said : &quot; This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spir@@ alling b@@ ills for basic essenti@@ als , before they can even start thinking about for@@ king out thousands of po@@ unds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence .
F@@ emin@@ ists take on race and police conduct post@@ -F@@ erg@@ us@@ on
The un@@ armed teen@@ ager was killed by a police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ o . , earlier this month .
At@@ ten@@ de@@ es hold their hands up while ch@@ anting , &quot; Hand@@ s up , don &apos;t shoot , &quot; as they wait in line before the f@@ uner@@ al .
After two weeks of protests in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo@@ . over the shooting of un@@ armed teen@@ ager Michael Brown , blo@@ g@@ ger Mi@@ ri@@ am Zo@@ ila Per@@ ez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white femin@@ ists .
In her experience , white femin@@ ist comm@@ enters priori@@ tiz@@ ed gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality .
But as tensions rose in the Mid@@ west and drew nation@@ wide coverage , Per@@ ez saw responses from white women that cent@@ ered 100 percent around race .
Compar@@ ed to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9 , the personal ess@@ ays with titles like &quot; thoughts on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on as a white woman &quot; and &quot; F@@ emin@@ ism Is Not Just About Women &apos;s Op@@ pression &quot; came relatively late .
But to Per@@ ez , it demonstrated a significant shift .
&quot; In femin@@ ism , I don &apos;t think you get a lot of people talking about wh@@ it@@ eness and privilege in such a high level way , &quot; she said .
People felt called to voice something about what happened .
It &apos;s very emb@@ lem@@ atic of the crisis we face and because &#91; the situation in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &#93; is so ra@@ ci@@ alized , they have to call that out .
For O@@ hi@@ o State University English professor K@@ orith@@ a Mitch@@ ell , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren &apos;t seen as &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; in the cultural sphere .
&quot; I can post something f@@ unny on Facebook about what &apos;s going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place , &quot; said Mitch@@ ell .
When I post something about how people of color are under si@@ ege in their own country , the silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
&quot; How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? &quot; she asked .
For black women like Mitch@@ ell who have studied race , gender and sexu@@ ality in U.S. history , there is no di@@ ch@@ ot@@ om@@ y between issues regarding race and gender .
To her , black women have not had the luxury of ne@@ at@@ ly separ@@ ating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstre@@ am femin@@ ist sp@@ heres , Angela H@@ atter@@ y , women and gender studies professor at George Mas@@ on University , says their predec@@ essors did the opposite .
&quot; Between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10,000 black men were l@@ yn@@ ched and the justification was almost always the rap@@ e of a white woman , &quot; said H@@ atter@@ y .
You needed the white woman to be complic@@ it in the nar@@ r@@ ative to justify the l@@ yn@@ ching .
To H@@ atter@@ y , the break@@ down between white and black women came when white suff@@ ra@@ gi@@ sts like Sus@@ an B. Anth@@ ony surve@@ yed the landscape in the late 18@@ 00@@ s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or bl@@ acks .
&quot; They made the decision to put their eggs in the bas@@ ket for votes for women and votes for Bl@@ acks would come later , &quot; said H@@ atter@@ y .
To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don &apos;t trust white women .
We haven &apos;t done a good job .
We haven &apos;t helped black women protect their hus@@ bands and sons ever .
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to organize against l@@ yn@@ ching as the Association of Southern W@@ om@@ an for the Pre@@ vention of Lyn@@ ching .
The group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said Mitch@@ ell .
To Mitch@@ ell , the up@@ s@@ well of white femin@@ ist responses to the issues raised by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on - police conduct , ra@@ cial discrimination - reflect the times white femin@@ ists have had to play &quot; catch up &quot; to issues black women have gra@@ p@@ pled with for generations .
&quot; W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be great if the activists who have those &#91; traditional femin@@ ist &#93; platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? &quot; posed Mitch@@ ell .
Second wave femin@@ ists who made care@@ ers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now fig@@ uring out what that means .
Not@@ ed white femin@@ ist activ@@ ist Gl@@ oria St@@ einem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown &apos;s shooting to post a pointed column by Gu@@ ardi@@ an colum@@ n@@ ist Reb@@ ec@@ ca Car@@ roll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism .
&quot; I hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and ra@@ cial opinions that are measur@@ ably different in public poll@@ s - will lead the change , &quot; St@@ einem wrote .
Although St@@ einem has vou@@ ched for a more inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in America still pu@@ zzle some .
American Enterprise Institute schol@@ ar Christ@@ ina Somm@@ ers , author of &quot; Who St@@ ole F@@ emin@@ ism ? , &quot; told She The People that young men in the United States , especially young men of color , are &quot; far more vulnerable than their si@@ sters , &quot; but St@@ einem &apos;s remarks on F@@ erg@@ us@@ on counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
But when the White House recently initiated a small program , My Bro@@ ther &apos;s Ke@@ eper , to help vulnerable black and His@@ pan@@ ic young men , there was an an@@ gr@@ y reaction from many femin@@ ists , including Gl@@ oria St@@ einem .
Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the for@@ efront of mainstre@@ am femin@@ ism .
After U.S. border pat@@ rol ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors at the country &apos;s sou@@ thwest border this year , immigration reform sur@@ faced once again - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
Andrea Merc@@ ado , co-@@ chair of We Bel@@ ong Together , an organization mobili@@ zing women for immigration reform , said that in order to re@@ brand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share im@@ migrant women &apos;s stories .
&quot; They speak for themselves , &quot; Merc@@ ado said .
When the vast majority of employment visas are given to &#91; male immigrants &#93; , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; These stories res@@ on@@ ate with women &apos;s organizations , &quot; she said .
I@@ p@@ swi@@ ch &apos; p@@ ig in residence &apos; house for sale
A picture for a house for sale in Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large p@@ ig at rest in the living room .
On sale for £ 120@@ ,000 , the det@@ ached one-@@ bedroom property si@@ ts on a private road in I@@ p@@ swi@@ ch .
The partic@@ ul@@ ars featured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a p@@ ig with its head res@@ ting on a sett@@ ee .
Estate agents Conn@@ ells said the p@@ ig in the photo was the home owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; However , the photo was put up in error and has since been removed , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ woman for the company said .
In the partic@@ ul@@ ars for the property , Conn@@ ells described the former meeting house as a &quot; unique one bedroom det@@ ached house . &quot;
Although the agency has removed the image from its website , it still appears in public@@ ity material .
The house sale has spark@@ ed interest on social media , where some have en@@ quired whether the p@@ ig is included in the sale .
S@@ W town of Harv@@ ey has fresh milli@@ on@@ aire after Lot@@ to win
A Harv@@ ey lot@@ to player is in the month .
The search is on for a new milli@@ on@@ aire in Per@@ th &apos;s south-@@ west , with one lucky person taking home nearly $ 1.1 million from Saturday night &apos;s lot@@ to draw .
A Harv@@ ey new@@ sag@@ ency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years , the last being $ 1 million in November 2009 .
However the lucky winner has yet to come forward .
O@@ w@@ ner of the store Steve For@@ ward said the win was creating a bu@@ z@@ z around the small town in Per@@ th &apos;s south west .
It &apos;s the talk of the town and everyone is pretty exc@@ ited .
We thought a win like this might be close .
Ei@@ ght W@@ A winners have celebrated division one wins last month , c@@ apping off a lucky few weeks for the state &apos;s players .
Last week a Cann@@ ing V@@ ale player became one of five August milli@@ on@@ aire &apos;s , following a Bel@@ mont couple &apos;s massive $ 7.@@ 5 million win only a few weeks prior .
The winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gi@@ fted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house .
The Harv@@ ey milli@@ on@@ aire brings W@@ A up to 59 division one winners for the year , tot@@ alling in nearly $ 85 million .
Le@@ oni@@ das beg@@ ged in the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial arena
It was not only the gla@@ di@@ ators that stood ank@@ le deep in the mu@@ d at the park during Rhein@@ bach &apos;s first Roman day .
The appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who bra@@ ved the rain and autumn chill , and who were completely taken in by the historical show .
There was a color@@ ful start with represent@@ ations , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information on Roman times and their significance to the R@@ hin@@ eland .
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ al arts group from the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; Am@@ or Mor@@ tis &quot; , which , every time it stopped ra@@ ining , sei@@ zed the opportunity to demonstrate their robust mar@@ ti@@ al arts in the soft sand covered arena .
The owner of gla@@ di@@ ators &quot; Le@@ oni@@ das &quot; proved himself to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and expert present@@ er , who sent men , one after one , into the ring for a hero@@ ic du@@ el in a variety of gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial gen@@ res .
At first the &quot; pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs &quot; were lined up with a rec@@ t@@ ang@@ ular shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , as well a cu@@ isse on the left leg , and a v@@ embra@@ ce on the right arm .
Then there were the &quot; Ess@@ ed@@ ari@@ i &quot; wearing a bre@@ ast-@@ plate , and carrying a short s@@ word and a spe@@ ar , as well as an iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , a cu@@ isse and an arm guard .
What was particular impressive was the performance of the &quot; Re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , who went up against the &quot; Sec@@ utor &quot; with a cast@@ -@@ net , tri@@ dent and d@@ ag@@ ger , and who , after a short fight , kno@@ cked the guys to the ground .
The s@@ words c@@ las@@ hed against one another , the shi@@ el@@ ds c@@ lan@@ ked and the sp@@ ears fle@@ w , zo@@ oming through the arena , so much so that you fear@@ ed for the safety of the gla@@ di@@ ators .
However , the gigan@@ tic &quot; Sum@@ ma Ru@@ dis &quot; , a mus@@ cular refer@@ ee , constantly kept a keen eye on them .
&quot; We wanted to revi@@ ve the Roman everyday life , and enable the culture of Roman times to be experienced &quot; , Lor@@ enz E@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , the chairman of the events organization &quot; Fre@@ undes@@ kreis Rö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al &quot; explained as the intention behind the spectac@@ le .
Cl@@ aus W@@ eh@@ age , the dep@@ uty may@@ or , announced in his welcome speech that after two years of preparation , the park was transformed for one day into an &quot; O@@ pp@@ i@@ dum Roman@@ um &quot; , a Roman city .
In the end , the Rom@@ ans not only brought war and con@@ quest to our region , but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings , which we can still admire today .
Some of these remains could also be mar@@ vel@@ ed at during the Roman day , such as &quot; A@@ du@@ ä@@ duk@@ t-@@ Mar@@ m@@ or &quot; from the elev@@ en-@@ meter high , and 14@@ 00 meter long , Roman can@@ al bridge , which is the only one in Lü@@ ft@@ el@@ berg .
The Fron@@ tin@@ us organization compared , both then and now , the water and energy supply , and the managing director , Pet@@ ra Fri@@ cke , said : &quot; We still deri@@ ve benefit today from the knowledge of back then &quot; .
This was confirmed by the surve@@ y@@ or R@@ alp@@ h Heili@@ ger from &quot; Ingenie@@ ur@@ te@@ am@@ Zwei &quot; in Rhein@@ back , who introduced the instruments used by the Rom@@ ans for surve@@ ying , such as the Chor@@ ob@@ at , Gro@@ ma and Di@@ op@@ tra .
The Rö@@ mer@@ villa in Blan@@ ken@@ heim presented sk@@ et@@ ches and models of the excav@@ ations of 18@@ 94 , as well as bri@@ cks made from the original hypo@@ cau@@ st , for@@ c@@ ed-@@ air heating , which was once used to warm up Rö@@ mer@@ villa .
The foot@@ prints of a w@@ olf and fox from two thousand years ago were also impressive , and were left behind after they tro@@ d in cla@@ y before it was bur@@ nt .
In 2011 the office of archaeological monument conservation at the state association in Rhein@@ land excav@@ ated the remains of a Roman Villa in an industrial estate in north Rhein@@ bach .
The en@@ closing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a k@@ il@@ n for dr@@ ying crops and mal@@ ting .
The building probably belong@@ ed to a Villa Rus@@ tica , an agricultural man@@ or , archae@@ ologist Dr. J@@ enni@@ fer Mor@@ schei@@ ser explained .
A range of finds from the excav@@ ation were presented in a glass cab@@ inet , among which were a large plate , several fine glass j@@ ars and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
Mor@@ schei@@ ser presum@@ ed that the Villa was there from between the first and fourth century An@@ no Dom@@ ini until the invasion of the German@@ ic people in the former Roman Rhein@@ land .
The children also kept themselves busy playing the Roman wind@@ m@@ ills game , similar to today &apos;s mill game , or they wrote , as did the Roman pupils at the time , their names with metal p@@ ens on wa@@ x tab@@ lets .
At the Roman thermal bath stand from Z@@ ül@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves ; at the Rhein@@ bach glass museum stand they made glass mo@@ sa@@ ics ; and at the Ei@@ fel Net@@ ter@@ sh@@ eim nature center stand , they got to use a heavy whe@@ at mill made of stone so they could gr@@ ind the flo@@ ur needed for a p@@ ita bread or mu@@ es@@ li .
The visitors ro@@ de through the park in a Roman carri@@ age , which had been re@@ constructed to be true to the original , and pul@@ led along by two cold blood horses , and also passed by the impressive city gym stand , where the results of their &quot; Roman project week &quot; were revealed .
From 13 to 21 September , the community of W@@ acht@@ berg will also participate in a Roman week , in what is being called Roman Year 2014 throughout the R@@ hin@@ eland . The event will remember the death of Kaiser August@@ us 2000 years ago .
Together with the clubs dedicated to local , regional and historical traditions and characteristics , as well as the W@@ acht@@ berg hiking club , the partnership association , and the Ober@@ b@@ ach@@ em am@@ ateur dram@@ atics club , hiking , rec@@ it@@ als , cooking evening and guidance for school classes , among other things , will be offered , and the Roman history of W@@ acht@@ berg shall be remembered .
The Roman legi@@ onn@@ aire will , for example , talk about his dra@@ f@@ ty work in W@@ acht@@ berg ; plants will be presented as living monuments of Roman times , and a hum@@ or@@ ous lesson on the matter of international understanding between a &quot; German@@ ic &quot; group from W@@ acht@@ berg and Roman inv@@ aders will be show@@ c@@ ased .
A@@ den@@ dorf el@@ ementary school has devoted itself to a week@@ -@@ long , Rom@@ an-@@ them@@ ed project .
The Roman week should , once again , enable us to experience the numerous and common , yet , at first gl@@ ance , no longer visible , traces of the Rom@@ ans in W@@ acht@@ berg .
W@@ acht@@ berg town hall will give a small presentation on the sanc@@ tu@@ ary in Ber@@ k@@ um , which was found in 18@@ 79 .
E@@ b@@ ola : The epide@@ mic is putting stra@@ in on West Africa &apos;s economy
The E@@ b@@ ola epide@@ mic in West Africa is also a huge hit for the economy .
Mark@@ ets have been abandoned , and international companies are keeping their distance .
The devastating E@@ b@@ ola epide@@ mic has dealt the economy in West Africa a heavy blow .
Cro@@ ps are rot@@ ting in the fields , mines have been deser@@ ted , and the markets have been abandoned . The virus has cost the region de@@ arly .
Even some international companies are keeping their distance .
&quot; The E@@ b@@ ola epide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one &quot; , the head of the African Development Bank , Donald Kab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , concluded .
Liber@@ ia is the most affected country
&quot; It is a total catastro@@ phe ; we are losing a lot of money &quot; , Al@@ ha@@ ji B@@ am@@ ogo said , who s@@ ells clothes in the second largest market in Liber@@ ia &apos;s capital city , Mon@@ ro@@ via .
The only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant against E@@ b@@ ola .
Liber@@ ia is the country most affected by the virus ; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the f@@ ever .
The health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all cor@@ ners of the country .
The virus has even spread to Guinea , Sierra Leone and Nigeria .
In total , more than 1500 people have already died , and thousands more have been infected .
Foreign businesses are pul@@ ling their employees out
All over countries rich with resources , companies are susp@@ ending operations .
Foreign companies such as the steel group Ar@@ cel@@ or Mitt@@ al are with@@ drawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions .
Even local tra@@ ders and farmers are re@@ acting : Only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to re@@ plen@@ ish their supplies .
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liber@@ ia , where they have been put under quar@@ ant@@ ine , c@@ ac@@ ao and coffee be@@ ans , to name a few , and which are important for export , are rot@@ ting in the fields .
The farmers do not dare leave their homes for the crops .
Food suppliers are scar@@ ce
&quot; People are traveling less and less &quot; , Phil@@ li@@ pe De V@@ re@@ yer , a Par@@ isi@@ an expert on the economy of West Africa said .
For example , a man , who normally goes to the market and s@@ ells his vegetables , is choosing to stay at home .
The population is , therefore , facing the consequences of the epide@@ mic head on and feeling the pressure : Food suppliers are scar@@ ce .
The supply of st@@ ap@@ le foods such as rice is d@@ wind@@ ling in the markets .
At the same time , the image of the region , which is heavily reli@@ ant on international companies , is under threat , and this has far-reaching consequences .
The biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time , Phil@@ li@@ ppe Hu@@ gon , from the French Th@@ ink T@@ ank , Ir@@ is , said .
What is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread .
Invest@@ ors may get the impression &quot; that it is dangerous to live in Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liber@@ ia , and , therefore , also to invest &quot; , Hu@@ gon warned .
The disease is also bur@@ dening the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the States
The disease is also bur@@ dening the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the affected States .
The rating agency M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s fears that their budgets are being heavily stra@@ ined by the high expenditure on the health system , and also by the dec@@ lining economy .
The African Development Bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tune of 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) to the health systems of affected countries .
The effects in Nigeria , where up to now only a few E@@ b@@ ola cases have been diagno@@ sed , are already notic@@ eable .
Yet the o@@ il-@@ rich region in the south of the N@@ iger Delta is not yet affected .
However , elsewhere , many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming infected .
There is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations .

The original name , &quot; Sch@@ ütz@@ en@@ gesellschaft T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ g@@ au &quot; ( gun society T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald Bern@@ g@@ au ) dates back to 19@@ 07 , when , on 21st March , the club was founded and described as &quot; social entertainment by means of pist@@ ol and small-@@ cali@@ ber target practice &quot; .
In 19@@ 37 the Nazi regime closed the club down .
Then on 30@@ th April 1964 , 19 young men founded the club again , and launched the &quot; new &quot; gun club &quot; T@@ ann@@ en@@ wald &quot; in Bern@@ g@@ au at Lu@@ kas guest@@ -@@ house .
Karl März and Ad@@ olf Ri@@ ed led the club as range officers during its tough early years . The main objective then was to find a club pub and set up a shooting company .
As early as autumn 1965 the shooting club started out in &quot; L@@ ein@@ inger &quot; guest house with two teams competing against one another .
The following year , target shooting was set up as a sport , organized into seven teams , ranging in ability , all the way up to the local premi@@ er leag@@ ue .
The club records roll out every year , and the magic 3@@ 80 rounds were set up for the first time in 1980 by Ru@@ di Mei@@ er .
Just as the achievements of the active members has increased , so have the number of members .
Once the club pub &quot; L@@ ein@@ inger &quot; no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club , the club &apos;s management at the time , lead by Johann R@@ inn , decided to set up its future home in the bas@@ ement room of the new &quot; Land@@ gas@@ thof H@@ är@@ tei@@ s &quot; ( a country hotel ) .
After 27@@ 00 hours of hard work , Father Str@@ asser issued the bl@@ essing of the church for the new g@@ uns room on 8th May 1988 .
One of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 4@@ 4th local shooting competition , which is linked to the formal consec@@ r@@ ation of the new shooting flag in July 1991 .
On 23@@ rd and 24@@ th April 1994 , the shooting club celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
In 1995 the c@@ ann@@ on group was founded .
Josef Sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was the head of the c@@ ann@@ on division .
Organ@@ izing the Bavarian Cann@@ on Meeting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the &quot; c@@ ann@@ on sh@@ oo@@ ters &quot; , and for the club as a whole .
Many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to moderni@@ ze the rooms and shooting facilities in the Bern@@ g@@ au courtyard , making it state of the art .
Ele@@ ven teams go head to head
The sporting achievements of the shooting club are also impressive .
Currently there are a total of el@@ even teams that are taking part in the competitions : six air rif@@ les teams , one pel@@ let gun team , one K@@ K@@ 1 sport target pist@@ ol team , one youth team and two ol@@ d-@@ tim@@ er teams .
The first team comp@@ ris@@ ed of L@@ ars Ell@@ rich , Kath@@ ar@@ ina Ell@@ rich , St@@ eff@@ i Grad and Ker@@ sti@@ n Kell@@ er@@ mann was promoted to number 1 in the regional leag@@ ue in 2013 / 14 , up from the local premi@@ er leag@@ ue ( the highest of the shooting leag@@ ues in the AN@@ B ) .
The second team comp@@ ris@@ ed of Ver@@ ena M@@ oo@@ s@@ burger , Alexand@@ ra Mei@@ er , E@@ va Schuh@@ mann and To@@ bi@@ as Gr@@ am@@ l was promoted from the North local leag@@ ue to the local premi@@ er leag@@ ue .
In addition to shooting , events such as Bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ chen , Fa@@ sch@@ ing and Köni@@ gs@@ ball , club excursions and also Christmas celebrations are all club traditions .
The sh@@ oo@@ ters also attend the parish and community festivals .
Tony Ste@@ wart cr@@ ash@@ es in return to track
Tony Ste@@ wart &apos;s return to the track has ended only a little over hal@@ f@@ way through his race at Atlan@@ ta Motor Spe@@ ed@@ way .
Ste@@ wart hit the wall for the second time after his right front ti@@ re ble@@ w out on l@@ ap 17@@ 2 , ending his night .
Ste@@ wart dro@@ ve his batter@@ ed car to the garage and then ex@@ ited without speaking to re@@ por@@ ters .
His crew chief C@@ had John@@ ston said the 14 team was disappointed , but will now start focusing on next weekend &apos;s race in Rich@@ mond , Vir@@ g@@ inia .
&quot; I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him , &quot; John@@ ston said .
We &apos;ll go on to Rich@@ mond and hope we can do better there .
Ste@@ wart first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night &apos;s race following a col@@ li@@ sion with Ky@@ le Bus@@ ch , requiring work to the right side of his car .
&quot; I went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well , &quot; John@@ ston said , adding , &quot; It just didn &apos;t work out . &quot;
Not long after the second crash , Ste@@ wart &apos;s car was loaded onto the hau@@ ler and the team was packed up and ready to leave .
Ste@@ wart ski@@ pped three N@@ AS@@ CA@@ R Sp@@ rin@@ t Cup races after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dir@@ t-@@ track race in up@@ state New York .
He decided to return this week , need@@ ing to win either at Atlan@@ ta or the next race at Rich@@ mond to claim a spot in the Ch@@ ase .
He returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-@@ year-old Kev@@ in W@@ ard J@@ r . , who had step@@ ped on the track to confront Ste@@ wart during a race .
Auth@@ orities said Friday that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks .
No decision has been made about whether Ste@@ wart will face charges .
The three-@@ time champion received a big che@@ er when he was introduced before the race .
Starting in the 12th spot , Ste@@ wart ran in the top 10 early in the race , getting as high as fourth .
Then , on l@@ ap 12@@ 2 after a rest@@ art , Bus@@ ch &apos;s No .
18 machine got loose coming out of turn 2 and b@@ ang@@ ed into Ste@@ wart , sending both cars against the wall .
Ste@@ wart carried on but dropped back to 21st .

Ukrainian army has abandoned Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k airport
Pro-@@ Russian figh@@ ters are gaining ground again in East Ukraine .
Following heavy fighting in which Russian tank divisions are also said to have participated , the Ukrainian army has today , Monday , abandoned Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k airport , the re@@ bel stron@@ gh@@ old .
The army announced at the same time that over the past 24 hours , seven soldiers have been killed .
The Ukrainian President , Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ schen@@ ko , had previously taken appropriate action personally due to the heavy defe@@ ats suffered by his army in the fight against the separ@@ ati@@ sts , and announced changes to the senior leadership of the army without going into detail .
Pro-@@ Russian separ@@ ati@@ sts shot down an aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops , pro-@@ Russian separ@@ ati@@ sts say that they have once again shot down a war@@ plane and two military helicop@@ ters .
Reb@@ el forces announced on Monday that around 100 soldiers are also believed to have been injured or killed in fighting in the Don@@ ez@@ k region ; according to Russian agencies .
Co@@ ast@@ guard ships sun@@ k
The re@@ bels also claimed that for the first time they have sun@@ k two of the Ukrainian coast@@ guard &apos;s boats in the Sea of A@@ zo@@ v .
The Ukrainian border police confirmed that two of its ships came under fire on Sunday near to the har@@ bor town of Mari@@ u@@ pol .
During the attack seven border gu@@ ards were injured , according to a spo@@ kes@@ person speaking to the station 1@@ 12.@@ ua in K@@ iev .

NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break their agreements with Russian as a result of their planned deployment to East Europe in response to the Ukrainian crisis .
In Brussels on Monday , the Secretary General of NATO , Anders Fo@@ gh Ras@@ mus@@ sen , said that NATO will adhere to the NATO-@@ Russia Council formation agreement of 1997 .
Nevertheless , the head of NATO accused Russia of &quot; a flag@@ rant breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; Today we must face up to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner &quot; , Ras@@ mus@@ sen said .
Docum@@ ents and statements from the Russian side reveal &quot; that they consider us as enemies &quot; .
Str@@ eng@@ th@@ ened NATO presence
Ras@@ mus@@ sen also announced that he wants to strengthen the presence of NATO in East Europe .
A NATO summit meeting in Wales to decide on a &quot; Re@@ ad@@ iness Action Plan &quot; will ensure that &quot; we will have a more visible NATO presence in the East , if needs be &quot; , Ras@@ mus@@ sen explained in Brussels on Monday .
K@@ iev and Moscow have agreed to new talks on gas
According to official data , Russia and Ukraine have agreed to new talks to settle disputes over gas .
The negotiations have been scheduled to take place next Saturday , the Russian Minister of Energy , Alexander Now@@ ak , said on Monday .
The decision of the European Union as to whether they will also send a representative to the talks is yet to be made .
Due to the disputes over gas prices , Ukraine has not been receiving fuel from Russia for weeks .
The EU Energy Commissioner , Gün@@ ther O@@ ett@@ inger has recently arbitr@@ ated between the two sides .
Ukraine warned that Russia could also suspend the gas supply to Europe .
Europe purchases around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources , a large proportion of which flows through Ukraine .
Merkel puts her foot down : &quot; Let &apos;s be clear &quot; , t@@ olls will come
Once again the Chancellor makes herself clear .
However , there is still no charter expl@@ aining all the complex details .
Sti@@ ff opposition from the CD@@ U against the t@@ olls is making the CS@@ U increasingly ang@@ ri@@ er .
Following persistent opposition from the CD@@ U , the Chancellor of Germany , Angela Merkel , has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of t@@ olls .
&quot; Let &apos;s be crystal clear : They are mentioned in the coalition agreement , and we will have them &quot; , the party leader said on Monday following a CD@@ U party conference with top committees in Berlin .
But Merkel has not , for the time being , established a detailed model .
&quot; Cer@@ tain parameters &quot; were mentioned in the black@@ -@@ red government program .
The Minister of Transport , Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) &quot; made a suggestion , and we are continuing to work on it &quot; .
The N@@ W-@@ CD@@ U , however , is insi@@ sting that t@@ olls on all streets be obj@@ ected against .
Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance , Wolfgang Sch@@ ä@@ ub@@ le ( CD@@ U ) , is participating construc@@ tively in the consultations on the draft bill .
He has spoken with D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt on the topic and about further possibilities for cap@@ itali@@ zing more and investing more in infrastructure , such as developing broadband .
&quot; There is nothing special about it &quot; . On Sunday , Sch@@ ä@@ ub@@ le let an article in the Spiegel pass without comment , which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compens@@ ating motorway investors with returns on the t@@ olls - after the 20@@ 17 election .
As a result , the leader of the CS@@ U , Hor@@ st Seeh@@ of@@ er , warned about developing toll concepts in the cab@@ inet against the Minister in charge .
The dep@@ uty leader of the CD@@ U , Ar@@ min La@@ sch@@ et , reinforced his objections .
&quot; The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and A-@@ roads would get t@@ olls &quot; , the state chairman for North R@@ hin@@ e-@@ West@@ phal@@ ia said .
The fact that Seeh@@ of@@ er has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign .
Opposition to the plans has also been received from the CD@@ U state association in Bad@@ en-@@ Wür@@ tt@@ emberg and R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate .
This is due to concerns that a toll would have a negative impact on small-@@ scale border traffic to neighbor@@ ing states .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has demanded loy@@ alty to the coalition following criticism of the t@@ olls from members of the CD@@ U .
Die Linke ( the L@@ ef@@ ties ) are considering the plans a failure given the argu@@ ing within the union .
&quot; The mess@@ ed up toll is dead &quot; , Bern@@ d Ri@@ ex@@ inger , the party leader , told the &quot; Neuen O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; ( newspaper ) on Monday .
&quot; If the toll fails , the Minister fails &quot; . D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt wants to introduce an obligation to have toll labels on all German streets as of 20@@ 16 .
According to the coalition agreement , car owners in German must not , however , have to face additional charges .
As such , road tax should be offset against t@@ olls for them .
According to EU law , however , the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality .
Gen@@ etic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed
A British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a mis@@ diagnosis .
Kar@@ in Ro@@ d@@ gers spent most of her teen@@ age life believ@@ ing that she only had years to live after she was diagno@@ sed with another disease .
She actually had Char@@ cot@@ -@@ Mari@@ e-@@ T@@ ooth disease ( CM@@ T ) - a group of inher@@ ited dis@@ orders that damage ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ ine .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK said that mis@@ diagnosis is a common problem among people with CM@@ T because so little is known about the condition .
About 23@@ ,000 people in the UK are thought to have CM@@ T , which can cause motor symptoms such as mus@@ cle weakness , an aw@@ k@@ ward ga@@ it and cur@@ led to@@ es .
Su@@ ffer@@ ers can also experience num@@ b@@ ness or pain and the condition is inc@@ ur@@ able and progressive , meaning symptoms get worse over time .
When Ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Fried@@ reich &apos;s at@@ ax@@ ia ( F@@ A ) - a condition which had a very poor progno@@ sis .
Ro@@ d@@ gers thought that she was going to be whe@@ el@@ chair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30@@ s .
The mo@@ ther@@ -@@ of-@@ two , who is now 51 , said : &quot; As a child I knew I couldn &apos;t do the same things as others .
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
I could never roll@@ er-@@ sk@@ ate or sk@@ at@@ ebo@@ ard with other kids and got bul@@ lied at school a lot because of the way I wal@@ ked and ran .
Ro@@ d@@ gers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her A@@ chil@@ les t@@ end@@ ons and strai@@ gh@@ ten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consult@@ ant left the room which said that she suffered from F@@ A .
&quot; I felt guilty because I &apos;d been no@@ sy and so I didn &apos;t tell anybody , but I did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the F@@ A Association , &quot; she said .
When I got the information back I was g@@ ob@@ sm@@ ack@@ ed and in the worst state of pan@@ ic possible .
I thought I &apos;d be in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own f@@ uner@@ al .
She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t deterior@@ ated as much as she thought they would have and asked her sur@@ ge@@ on about it .
He just stood up and hu@@ g@@ ged me and said &apos; my dear I don &apos;t think you have it , as you would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair now . &apos;
I think you have something a lot less life threatening .
After some genetic testing she was found to have CM@@ T .
&quot; When he explained what CM@@ T was , I thought I &apos;d drawn the lucky stra@@ w , &quot; she said .
Char@@ ity CM@@ T UK has launched CM@@ T awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
Re@@ tired Ser@@ ge@@ ant Major Ber@@ ni B@@ ie@@ ther has been working as an arti@@ fic@@ er ever since the closure of the former military training ground
Not a shot has been fi@@ red in the former military training ground in Mün@@ s@@ ingen for almost ten years .
Nevertheless , de@@ adly amm@@ uni@@ tion turns up in the center of the bio@@ sphere region of Sw@@ ab@@ ian J@@ ura every month .
The sh@@ ells are sometimes so dangerous still that they have to be det@@ on@@ ated there .
A de@@ af@@ ening b@@ ang ech@@ oes across the center of the bio@@ sphere region upon det@@ on@@ ation .
The last live round to be fi@@ red at the military training ground in Mün@@ s@@ ingen was in December 2004 , which , at the end of 2005 , after 110 years of military operation , was closed down .
Since then , the 6@@ 500 hectares of land has been the center of the Sw@@ ab@@ ian J@@ ura &apos;s bio@@ sphere region , which opened up 13 designated path@@ ways for hi@@ kers and cy@@ cli@@ sts .
Wash@@ ing@@ t@@ on-@@ area business owners &quot; tax burden moun@@ ts as economy re@@ bo@@ unds
A re@@ bound@@ ing economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs .
It also means higher taxes .
State and local tax b@@ ills for companies across the country grew mo@@ dest@@ ly last year as the economic recovery acceler@@ ated , according to new research released last week , and Wash@@ ing@@ t@@ on-@@ area firms were no exception .
District , Mar@@ y@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ inia businesses coll@@ ectively paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to state and local coff@@ ers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion collected in 2012 .
Busin@@ esses &quot; state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.@@ 3 percent , to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared with 3.@@ 9 percent the year before , and it was the third consec@@ utive year of growth after back@@ -to-@@ back years of shr@@ in@@ king b@@ ills in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose at a faster cli@@ p , 4.@@ 3 percent , than local le@@ vies , 3.@@ 9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young and the Center on State Tax@@ ation , a tax policy group .
More than half of the District &apos;s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s revenue comes from firms .
Vir@@ g@@ inia , at 28 percent , generates the least amount of tax revenue , proportion@@ ately , from business .
Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a re@@ bound in companies &quot; real estate values , researchers say , which pushed property taxes up 3.@@ 7 percent this year after three consec@@ utive years of sub-@@ 1 percent growth .
While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California , New York and Texas , it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well .
Companies in the District , Mar@@ y@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ inia coll@@ ectively for@@ ked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - year-@@ over-@@ year growth of 4.@@ 2 percent .
But the apparent bo@@ unc@@ eb@@ ack in property values isn &apos;t doing nearly as much to infl@@ ate state and local tax revenues in Mar@@ y@@ land , where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies &quot; tax b@@ ills .
Vir@@ g@@ inia and D.@@ C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax b@@ ills in the form of property taxes .
&quot; What &apos;s happening in Mar@@ y@@ land is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the D.@@ C. area , is owned either by the government or by non@@ profits , which don &apos;t pay property taxes , &quot; said Dou@@ glas Lin@@ d@@ hol@@ m , executive director of the Center on State Tax@@ ation .
So Mar@@ y@@ land is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
The recent re@@ bound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recover@@ ing real estate market .
Business incomes also appear to be on the m@@ end , according to the data .
Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.@@ 3 billion , up from $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
Mar@@ y@@ land collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
While tr@@ ending in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses isn &apos;t growing at the same pace in all three places .
The District &apos;s rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.@@ 3 percent , while Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s growth was substantially faster at 4.@@ 9 percent .
Only Vir@@ g@@ inia posted a bel@@ ow-@@ average tax bill b@@ ump of 4.@@ 1 percent .
Vir@@ g@@ inia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three juris@@ dic@@ tions ( all of which have flat corporate rates ) at 6 percent .
Mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s corporate rate is 8.@@ 25 percent , while the District &apos;s stands at a relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Vir@@ g@@ inia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Mar@@ y@@ land .
The District wasn &apos;t evaluated in the study .
Despite its advantage , Vir@@ g@@ inia is facing competitive pressure from its neigh@@ bor to the south .
North Carol@@ ina recently signed legislation lower@@ ing its corporate rate this year from 6.@@ 9 percent to 6 percent , in line with Vir@@ g@@ inia , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state &apos;s business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 20@@ 17 .
Meanwhile , small businesses in the Washington region seem to be far@@ ing better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass@@ -@@ through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District , Mar@@ y@@ land and Vir@@ g@@ inia sur@@ ged 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
Res@@ ear@@ chers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nation@@ wide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.@@ 2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year .
However , the Washington area may lag behind as the slow@@ down in federal spending takes its toll on the region &apos;s labor market .
Twin town : German beer for Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou
H@@ ops and m@@ alt - a popular combination even in China .
German beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in China .
Frankfurt &apos;s twin town in China would like a bre@@ wer@@ y , and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
German beer bre@@ w@@ ed in Frankfurt &apos;s twin town of Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials .
&quot; We would be delighted if a German bre@@ wer@@ y would set up business in our city &quot; , the dep@@ uty party secret@@ ary of the southern Chinese city , L@@ i Y@@ i@@ wei , said this week during a visit to the city by an SP@@ D deleg@@ ate .
Time and time again throughout the conversation , the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metro@@ polis .
Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou , which is also known as C@@ anton in Germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in China L@@ i adverti@@ sed .
So , the people also have the buying power to afford German beer .
The H@@ essi@@ an SP@@ D chairman Th@@ or@@ sten Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ mb@@ el , who led the German delegation , said to the host that he would keeps his ears open in Germany for a possible partner .
&quot; You don &apos;t need a lot to make beer : good water , grain and a z@@ est for life &quot; , he added over lunch with the senior party member in Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou .
This z@@ est for like already be@@ ams out of Mr L@@ i , he said flat@@ tering the host .
After that , the official from Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou cli@@ cked gl@@ asses with Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ mb@@ el - albeit with red wine , which was served with dinner .
The Chinese brand T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o has traces leading back to the German art of bre@@ wing .
T@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is bre@@ w@@ ed according to the German pur@@ ity law .
More business operations
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou , the dep@@ uty party leader , L@@ i , said .
Lufthansa used to offer such a flight , but can@@ cel@@ ed it for economic reasons in 2012 .
&quot; It would be worth it again &quot; , the local politi@@ cian seemed convinced .
&quot; The business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow &quot; .
At present , travelers would have to take a det@@ our via Ch@@ angsh@@ a in the province of H@@ un@@ an , L@@ i compl@@ ained .
The administration of the province of Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong , whose capital city is Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou , is also hoping for a flight connection .
The dep@@ uty govern@@ or of the province , Ch@@ en Y@@ un@@ x@@ ian , empha@@ sized this wish during his talks with the social democ@@ rat .
&quot; That is a very good idea &quot; , Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ mb@@ el answered - the Chinese dep@@ uty minister , L@@ i J@@ inj@@ un , an intimate expert on Germany , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
Well@@ -@@ cultiv@@ ated partnership
The aff@@ able dep@@ uty party leader of Gu@@ ang@@ zh@@ ou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
L@@ i Y@@ i@@ wei has already been to the Main , but not in the capacity of his role .
He only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption alleg@@ ations .

Environ@@ ment@@ ally friendly vacuum clean@@ ers and increasing wages
Stri@@ ct environmental standards for the future shall apply to all cars and vacuum clean@@ ers that go on sale as of today .
As of September 1st , new vacuum clean@@ ers will come with a label , similar to that on refriger@@ ators and washing machines , which will allow bu@@ yers to see key information at a gl@@ ance , such as the energy efficiency of the app@@ liance .
New cars that fall under the emissions class &quot; Euro 6 &quot; will receive a higher nit@@ ric ox@@ ide value .

Ama@@ zon bu@@ ys T@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion
AM@@ A@@ Z@@ ON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning : The online retail@@ er - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video stre@@ aming service T@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion ( $ US@@ 9@@ 70 million ) .
The announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected T@@ wit@@ ch to be bought , but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer .
Three months ago the sale of T@@ wit@@ ch to Google &apos;s video service , for a cool billion , looked all wra@@ pped up , and the p@@ air@@ ing seemed natural .
T@@ wit@@ ch , founded only three years ago as Ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , set out to be a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of YouTube .
Instead , it quickly became a platform for gam@@ ers to broadcast their in-@@ game fe@@ ats ; a &quot; YouTube for live gaming , &quot; in Business In@@ si@@ der &apos;s words .
T@@ wit@@ ch &apos;s interface .
And &quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; a gen@@ re of videos in which wis@@ e@@ acres give ( mostly older ) games the M@@ yst@@ ery Science Theater treatment , are already popular on YouTube .
The point is , YouTube comes up a lot when descri@@ bing T@@ wit@@ ch , so the news that YouTube was acqu@@ iring T@@ wit@@ ch was gre@@ eted with a y@@ aw@@ n , a text@@ book example of an entr@@ en@@ ched tech company buying out a potential competi@@ tor .
It &apos;s a myst@@ ery why the deal with YouTube fell through , considering it was report@@ edly willing to pay no less than Ama@@ zon .
All we have at the moment is this statement from T@@ wit@@ ch CEO Emm@@ ett S@@ hear : &quot; We chose Ama@@ zon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . &quot;
Another myst@@ ery , frank@@ ly , is T@@ wit@@ ch &apos;s incredible success .
To s@@ no@@ bs like me who declare that they &apos;d rather play sports than watch them , it &apos;s hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself .
It &apos;s one thing to look over your friend &apos;s shoulder at 3 in the morning as she cre@@ eps through Resi@@ dent E@@ vi@@ l , and quite another to watch some r@@ ando get 20 head@@ shots in a row in Call of D@@ uty .
All the games you could be watching right now .
Another problem is that many of today &apos;s most popular games are first-@@ person , so watching foot@@ age of them , without controlling the view@@ point yourself , can be a Do It Ri@@ ght-@@ worthy recip@@ e for a head@@ ache .
I conc@@ ede that spe@@ ed@@ runs , in which the Rog@@ er Ban@@ ni@@ sters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are enter@@ taining .
But unless someone is a virtu@@ o@@ so at gaming or hum@@ our , his T@@ wit@@ ch channel isn &apos;t likely to be all that interesting .
But what do scep@@ tics like me know ?
T@@ wit@@ ch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the four@@ th-@@ largest source of peak internet traffic .
How , exactly , will Ama@@ zon capit@@ alise on this ?
It &apos;s hard to imagine T@@ wit@@ ch being fol@@ ded into Ama@@ zon Inst@@ ant Video as eleg@@ antly as YouTube could have just s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed T@@ wit@@ ch .
But T@@ wit@@ ch has something any company would love to attract : hor@@ des of adverti@@ ser-@@ co@@ v@@ eted young men .
As T@@ wit@@ ch chief S@@ hear said , Ama@@ zon and T@@ wit@@ ch &quot; are both bel@@ ie@@ vers in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no sign of shr@@ in@@ king , even - gul@@ p - as a spec@@ t@@ ator sport .
Some@@ thing is happening on the bo@@ un@@ cy castle at the Burg@@ gar@@ ten@@ fest ( castle garden festival ) .
The organiz@@ ers &apos; idea was right .
Despite the heavy down@@ pour of rain on Saturday evening , approximately 1200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden .
Ad@@ mission had to be stopped on occasion .
&quot; It was anno@@ ying &quot; , according to R@@ on S@@ em , one of the organiz@@ ers .
Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el lights and fun .
Max@@ im Sach@@ ra@@ j and R@@ on S@@ em co@@ ined the name &quot; Ar@@ mul@@ a &quot; from two Spanish words .
Since the open air castle garden in Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el was supposed to be@@ am out bright lights during the wide range of day@@ time and evening shows .
Well , you make your own fun anyway .
This was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air .
The organiz@@ ers promised a festival fit for all generations .
And that is what they delivered .
Around the supplies stand located in the mead@@ ows of the castle garden , people from Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el , but also guests from near and far , made themselves at home .
They followed the first live performance , t@@ apped their feet in time , and enjoyed refres@@ h@@ ments . In short : P@@ ure relaxation and enjoyment .
And that goes for all generations .
Whilst some people spra@@ w@@ led out on blan@@ k@@ ets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar , which had been car@@ ted in especially , others indul@@ ged in a glass of wine in the wine store , and the kids went cra@@ zy on the bo@@ un@@ cy castle , which was a huge attraction for the little guests .
However , even the children &apos;s face painting kept the volunte@@ ers &apos; hands full , in the stric@@ test meaning of the word , as the children rus@@ hed to become men , and con@@ j@@ ure up f@@ anci@@ ful cre@@ ations on their small faces .
The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a sk@@ at@@ ebo@@ ard workshop , which the Goo@@ d@@ foot@@ -@@ Crew from Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el had organized .
And then the rain came .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before 5 : 30 PM the rain pel@@ ted down onto the visitors ; and families did a run@@ ner in search of somewhere dry .
Despite this , the festival &apos;s attractions did not get called off .
&quot; More people than expected came &quot; , Rom S@@ em said , who called the event a &quot; success all round &quot; .
As such , nothing is going to stop them from repe@@ ating the big party next year .
Even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event , the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for S@@ em .
He said that one anno@@ ying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily .
Appar@@ ently not enough security gu@@ ards had been booked with the security company .
The consequence : Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds .
Feedback has been very good .
In a preliminary and cau@@ tious estim@@ ation , the Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el co-@@ organiz@@ er estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden .
There were problems with the sound engineering .
The hip h@@ op band from Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el , Blo@@ cks &apos; n &apos; Ro@@ x , abandoned their performance somewhat unn@@ er@@ ved by these problems .
The engineers could not get a half-@@ decent sound out of it .
A sh@@ ish@@ a lounge had been planned but could not be built because the t@@ ents could not be delivered to Sal@@ zw@@ ed@@ el due to a punc@@ ture .
The organiz@@ er insi@@ sted that &quot; they will , however , be there next year &quot; .
The premi@@ er of the Am@@ ul@@ a-@@ Op@@ en-@@ Air@@ s was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors .
And that was with bad weather .
Nevertheless , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes , which will be exc@@ used as it was their first time , but which have to be avoided next time round .
The event organiz@@ ers also had to accept criticism on the social networking site Facebook .
&quot; Sor@@ ry , but for twelve euros , I really expected more &quot; , Mel@@ an@@ ie Mei@@ er comm@@ ented on the event &apos;s page .
&quot; Unfortunately , you bit off more than you could che@@ w &quot; , according to E@@ le Zimmer@@ mann on the same page .
For others , the te@@ e@@ thing problems were not such a big issue .
I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rub@@ b@@ ish , but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running .
H@@ ats off ! &quot; , Steph@@ an@@ ie Jen@@ ß wrote about Am@@ ula .
Now the organiz@@ ers have a year &apos;s time to address these criticisms .
New ra@@ dar d@@ ome in Ber@@ k@@ um : W@@ acht@@ berg &apos;s land@@ mark d@@ wind@@ les
And not as one would expect .
In fact , the structural element , which is ready , is waiting to be installed onto the structure .
But this is just one of many things that need doing : Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation ra@@ dar T@@ IR@@ A , the case , known as the ra@@ dar d@@ ome , is to be completely re@@ built .
With a diameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters , the new ra@@ dar d@@ ome will be somewhat smaller than the old one .
That said , the size will still be a world record .
The final phase in completing the new case is to change the cap
The top quarter of the old case will be separated and li@@ fted by a c@@ ran@@ e .
After that , the last quarter of the new case will be put in place .
As long as the weather is on their side , this should take place at the start of this week .

Will the Burg@@ ver@@ eine ( castle clubs ) get back together again ?
Recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
The bo@@ ard@@ room is now contem@@ pl@@ ating the possibility of working together .
As an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , the dec@@ e@@ ased Richard Dim@@ bath , the former chair@@ men of Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Burg@@ fre@@ unde ( Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen castle friends ) , led the project in the French Gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
Up until a year ago , there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
Their points of view are now mark@@ edly different with regard to how the history of Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled .
Now the two are coming together : There should soon be talks about a joint venture .
Tor@@ sten S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( castle club ) and Her@@ bert Pi@@ ff@@ l ( castle friends ) , both members of the board , confirmed this in answer to our newspaper &apos;s query .
&quot; I have rung Mr Pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we get together &quot; , S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg reported .
In his opinion , all members of each club could come together again in the future .
This would enable qu@@ icker and more visible success to be achieved .
Wher@@ eas the castle friends , and the recently dec@@ e@@ ased Richard Dim@@ bath right up until the bitter end , had their eyes on re@@ construc@@ ting the castle in the mountain forest , the castle club , with S@@ j@@ ö@@ berg , want to &quot; develop and bring the premises to life &quot; in its original place .
Her@@ bert Pi@@ ff@@ l , the dep@@ uty chairman of castle friends , said himself that he was very pleased about the call .
He has been presi@@ ding over castle friends since the death of Dim@@ bath .
A new chair@@ person will be found mid September during a members &apos; meeting .
At the moment , the club has around 40 members according to the 74 year old .
&quot; After the death of my friend , Richard Dim@@ bath , we ad@@ jour@@ ned the club &apos;s activities initially out of respect &quot; . This &quot; period of thought &quot; has been necessary to &quot; think about how it can proceed &quot; .
According to Pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chair@@ person will then enter into discussions with the castle club .
Until then , the castle friends can get on with the current atmosp@@ her@@ ic picture within their group .
Pi@@ ff@@ l said that , at the moment , they still do not have a candidate for the chair .
&quot; However , I am confident that we will find someone &quot; . He himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad T@@ öl@@ z .
The new chair@@ person should be in Wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sh@@ au@@ sen .
The man from T@@ öl@@ z would , however , &quot; like to continue working with them &quot; on the project .
The different points of view on the subject of reconstruction will continue to exist for some time in Pi@@ ff@@ l &apos;s eyes .
He acknowled@@ ges Dim@@ bath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; , who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
Two similar projects , which are well under way in Austria and France , show that this idea is no easy task .
But with a high number of participants among the population , as well as some volunte@@ ers from all over the world , it will become a tourist magn@@ et .
Pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; Even I was skep@@ tical at first .
However , with time , I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project &quot; . It could create a &quot; unique characteristic &quot; for the city of ra@@ fts@@ men .
Otherwise , there is nothing here .
In addition , the project would be financed by EU grants , visitor tickets and potential spons@@ ors , Pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; The idea of reconstruction is , therefore , something that I personally do not want to simply abandon . He hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat .
Their aim to first of all document the history &quot; is important and good &quot; .
Then , we will see .
Smart ways to save on college text@@ books
With the cost of college text@@ books sur@@ passing $ 1,000 a year for many students , so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be s@@ op@@ hom@@ ore Mat@@ t Sch@@ ro@@ eder came up with a smart way to tri@@ m costs .
He worked out a system of bor@@ rowing books from up@@ per@@ class@@ men , offering nomin@@ al compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
&quot; My calcul@@ us book that usually costs $ 180 , I got for the sem@@ ester for $ 10 and a Chi@@ ck-@@ fil@@ -@@ A bis@@ cu@@ it , &quot; says Sch@@ ro@@ eder , 19 , who att@@ ends Co@@ ven@@ ant College in Georgia .
Re@@ quired texts for his last sem@@ ester would have cost $ 4@@ 30 , he says .
He spent $ 120 .
The College Board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,@@ 200 a year on text@@ books and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
Online out@@ lets and creative approaches like Sch@@ ro@@ eder &apos;s are increasingly the go@@ -@@ to choices for students .
R@@ enting text@@ books is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the sem@@ ester , often at a significant discount to buying .
Ne@@ eb@@ o Inc , which operates more than 250 camp@@ us book@@ stores , says text@@ book rentals have doub@@ led since 2011 .
Industry research shows that about one-@@ fourth of books at college book@@ stores in this past spring sem@@ ester were r@@ ented , says Ne@@ eb@@ o Vice President Tre@@ vor Me@@ yer .
Fe@@ wer than half of all texts are purchased at camp@@ us book@@ stores , according to the National Association of College Stor@@ es trade association .
Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal .
Bu@@ ying online
Some new book prices can be one-@@ third of what you might find at the camp@@ us book@@ store if you go online .
The nin@@ th edition of &quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; by R@@ on Lar@@ son , Bru@@ ce Ed@@ wards , and Robert Host@@ et@@ ler carries a list price of nearly $ 2@@ 90 but can be purchased new for $ 23@@ 9.@@ 99 at speci@@ alty text@@ book retail@@ er Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com.
Bu@@ ying used
If you do not mind other people &apos;s notes or wear and te@@ ar , used texts are a good option .
&quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; is selling for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 used on Ch@@ eg@@ g@@ .com.
Mat@@ t Cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , a senior at Bri@@ g@@ ham Young University , says he had paid 42 c@@ ents on Ama@@ zon@@ .com for a used copy of &quot; Strateg@@ ic Media Dec@@ isi@@ ons : Under@@ standing The Business End Of The Ad@@ verti@@ sing Business . &quot;
The book was selling for $ 48 new .
Aca@@ dem@@ ics like In@@ grid Bra@@ c@@ ey , director of the University of Mass@@ ach@@ us@@ etts at Am@@ her@@ st &apos;s College Without W@@ alls , suggest students check with their prof@@ essors to see if previous edi@@ tions are acceptable .
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the class@@ work .
If so , old edi@@ tions can often be found for a tiny fra@@ ction of the cost of the latest version .
Besides Ch@@ egg and Ama@@ zon , eBay Inc &apos;s Hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
R@@ enting
R@@ enting your text@@ books is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
For example , a student could rent &quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for the length of the sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
K@@ now the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes , highlighting , or wear and te@@ ar .
R@@ enter , bew@@ are : If you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
E-@@ books
Get@@ ting e-@@ books instead of traditional texts is another option .
Sometimes those books are essentially r@@ ented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Ama@@ zon@@ .com , Ch@@ egg and Bar@@ nes &amp; Nob@@ le Inc .
Ch@@ egg will rent &quot; Cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for six months for about $ 61 .
Bra@@ c@@ ey says students in literature classes can often find the best bar@@ gains since many classi@@ cs are now available to download for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
No matter what , shop around .
Jo@@ e G@@ ault , 29 , who is about to enter Pep@@ per@@ dine Law School , recommends using the IS@@ B@@ N number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
Before ordering online , G@@ ault says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
He learned that lesson the hard way .
A book he purchased was back@@ -@@ ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college book@@ store .
Why the Gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the Galax@@ y couldn &apos;t save the box office
Sy@@ lv@@ ester St@@ all@@ one &apos;s The Exp@@ end@@ ables 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the US , while S@@ in City : A Dame to K@@ ill For has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
The Cam@@ eron Di@@ az vehicle Sex Tap@@ e took only $ 14.@@ 6 million in its opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as How To Train Your Dra@@ gon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns .
An article from T@@ eleg@@ raph film cri@@ tic Rob@@ b@@ ie Col@@ lin indicates that , when it comes to children &apos;s movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
Col@@ lin called 2014 the &quot; the worst &quot; year yet for children &apos;s films , and described How To Train Your Dra@@ gon 2 as a merely &quot; functional &quot; fantas@@ y sequ@@ el .
But when it comes to film pit@@ ched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
In July , Entertainment Week@@ ly compared the average Cin@@ em@@ a@@ Sc@@ ore and Met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2@@ ,000 screens between May &apos;s Mem@@ orial Day holiday and July 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
The results , which take the opinion of both cinema audi@@ ences and film critics into account , suggest that this year &apos;s crop of films are of similar cali@@ bre last year &apos;s h@@ its .
Some comm@@ ent@@ ators have suggested that changing viewing hab@@ its and the increased popularity of web stre@@ aming services such as Net@@ fli@@ x may be to blame .
Director J@@ on F@@ av@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on Disney &apos;s forthcoming Jung@@ le Book film , told the website Hollywood Re@@ porter : &quot; I think times are changing . &quot;
We have to acknowledge that and not try to ch@@ ase what used to be .
In contrast to Hollywood &apos;s current box office sl@@ ump , Net@@ fli@@ x recently saw revenue from its stre@@ aming content service reach $ 1.@@ 2@@ b@@ n , almost dou@@ bling last year &apos;s figure of $ 8@@ 3@@ 7@@ m .
Last summer , director St@@ even Spiel@@ berg criticised studios for rel@@ ying too much on com@@ ic book fran@@ ch@@ ises , and predic@@ ted a Hollywood &quot; mel@@ t@@ down . &quot;
In light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators are argu@@ ing that his di@@ re proph@@ ec@@ y may have held some truth to it .
With summer 2015 set to us@@ her in a sl@@ ate of potential big box office h@@ its , including Aven@@ gers : Age of Ul@@ tr@@ on , Mini@@ ons and Jur@@ assi@@ c World , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic .
X-@@ Men producer Simon Kin@@ berg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply &quot; cy@@ c@@ lical , &quot; telling Hollywood Re@@ porter : &quot; Next summer will be the biggest bo@@ x-@@ office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . &quot;
A few years ago , when the second table tennis regional division was can@@ cel@@ ed in an attempt to stream@@ line the leag@@ ues , a step in the right directions was taken .
Now , the German table tennis association has introduced an additional , third leag@@ ue into the program .
The consequence : Any team that has not been promoted , has been dem@@ oted .
For example , Gö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s top class team , Tor@@ ped@@ o , avoided demo@@ tion in the premi@@ er leag@@ ue rel@@ eg@@ ation , but will now play in the fifth division as of next season .
The Tor@@ ped@@ o &apos;s women &apos;s team remain in the fourth division despite their superb cle@@ an-@@ swe@@ ep in the Region@@ alli@@ ga .
The Tor@@ ped@@ o boys and girls are starting in the L@@ ower Sax@@ ony lig@@ a , just like the l@@ ads from SC We@@ ende .
The S@@ G L@@ eng@@ lern and Tor@@ ped@@ o reserves are step@@ ping up into the new Verb@@ and@@ s@@ lig@@ a , but there are no longer any clubs from Gö@@ tt@@ ing@@ ern in the Landes@@ lig@@ a .
For the women , T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar does play in the Verb@@ and@@ s@@ lig@@ a , and the Tor@@ ped@@ o &apos;s second team plays in the Landes@@ lig@@ a .
From a structural point of view , this seems to be a better regional division , when in fact , it is just the new Southern Regional Premier League .
Step@@ ping up into this are : T@@ SV Se@@ ul@@ ingen , V@@ f@@ B Lö@@ ding@@ sen , Tor@@ ped@@ o III , Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Ein@@ beck , H@@ ammen@@ st@@ edt , Bo@@ ven@@ der SV , Lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , FC Wes@@ er and TT@@ C .
D@@ ran@@ s@@ feld and SC We@@ ende represent the area in the regional leag@@ ue , whereas TT@@ C II , Rot@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß , Bo@@ ven@@ der SV II and T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar II and III represent the area in the regional division . The Regional Premier League for women is at least k@@ icking off with a good start .
Gün@@ ter@@ sen , TT@@ C and T@@ TV Gei@@ sm@@ ar II are all here as part of the party .
In the regional leag@@ ue , Tor@@ ped@@ o III and S@@ atten@@ hausen / W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen are taking to the field .
With each of the nine teams
SC We@@ ende sends a girl into the small regional leag@@ ue .
Even the regional leag@@ ue &apos;s rel@@ ay team for SC@@ W boys , which is where Tor@@ ped@@ o II is also starting , is not complete .
As for the regional division , Gei@@ sm@@ ar , Tus@@ po We@@ ende and Bo@@ ven@@ der SV are heading into their season .
In the first season of the new@@ ly-@@ founded regional association , both district divisions from Gö@@ tt@@ ingen are starting out with each of the nine teams .
As for the West rel@@ ay team ; that is made up of Rot@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß II , Bo@@ ven@@ der SV III , Lau@@ bach II , Tor@@ ped@@ o IV and V , M@@ TV Gr@@ one , D@@ ran@@ s@@ felder SC II , M@@ iel@@ en@@ hausen and S@@ G L@@ eng@@ lern II .
S@@ atten@@ hausen / W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , Nikol@@ aus@@ berg and Land@@ ol@@ f@@ sh@@ au@@ sen are some of the teams making up the East rel@@ ay team .
The women &apos;s district division is made up of S@@ atten@@ hausen / W@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sh@@ au@@ sen II , Bil@@ sh@@ au@@ sen , Hem@@ eln , Se@@ ul@@ ingen II , Tus@@ po We@@ ende and S@@ G R@@ hum@@ e .
That is much better than the district of Oster@@ ode , where there are no longer any female teams at a district level .
It is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their potential . The innovative and bust@@ ling district committee are going to have to come up with something .
Nat@@ o summit : First protests in New@@ port and Cardiff
There have been protests over the weekend by those opposed to the Nat@@ o summit in New@@ port .
On Saturday , hundreds gathered in New@@ port city centre for an anti-@@ Nat@@ o mar@@ ch .
And on Sunday in Cardiff , around 150 people came together at Cardiff &apos;s county hall for what was described as a counter-@@ summit .
Stephen Fair@@ cl@@ ough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protes@@ ters who have trav@@ elled from Bri@@ d@@ gend to Belgium .

A search party involving local police and rescue squ@@ ad was sent out and the pair were found about 11@@ pm near Bri@@ dal V@@ eil Falls .
The girl had injured her kne@@ e and the man had fallen and hit his head .
Offic@@ ers remained with the pair overnight and they were win@@ ched out on Monday morning .
They were taken by am@@ bul@@ ance in a stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital .
Anti-@@ government protests escal@@ ate in Pakistan
Around 1000 protes@@ ters have been forced out of the P@@ TV buildings by soldiers , according to the Minister of Information , Per@@ v@@ ai@@ z Ras@@ hi@@ d .
After a good half an hour or so , the station began broadcasting again .
The director of P@@ TV , Ath@@ ar Far@@ oo@@ q , said that demonstr@@ ators armed with sti@@ cks had damaged equipment in the edi@@ torial offices .
There was no mentioned of the number of people killed or injured .
The demonstr@@ ators are demanding the resign@@ ation of the Head of Government , acc@@ using him of vote rig@@ ging .
The police announced that on Monday , around one kilom@@ eter away from the residence of the Prime Minister , Na@@ wa@@ z Sh@@ ari@@ f , approximately 3000 demonstr@@ ators c@@ las@@ hed with security forces .
According to statements released by the hospital , a police officer was injured .
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstr@@ ators attempted to gain access to Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
They are demanding the resign@@ ation of the Prime Minister .
Following a meeting in the army &apos;s headquarters on Sunday evening , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , stating there was &quot; no time to waste or a need to use violence &quot; .
The statement also announced that : &quot; The army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the State &quot; .
The escal@@ ating violence stir@@ red up concern that the military may have to intervene , a military that has already revol@@ ted on many occasions in the past .
The above protests , led by Im@@ ran Kh@@ an , an opposition politi@@ cian , and Ta@@ hi@@ ru@@ l Q@@ ad@@ ri , a pre@@ acher , have been ongoing since independence day on 14 August .
Sh@@ ari@@ f is ref@@ using to step down .
On Sunday Kh@@ an and Q@@ ad@@ ri called upon their supporters to per@@ severe .
&quot; We will not leave until we have forced Sh@@ ari@@ f to res@@ ign &quot; , Kh@@ an said .
Q@@ ad@@ ri made similar comments :
Kh@@ an acc@@ uses Sh@@ ari@@ f of having frau@@ dul@@ ently won the parliamentary vote last May .
Q@@ ad@@ ri is demanding the resign@@ ation of both the central and provin@@ cial governments .
A pro@@ visi@@ onal government should then reform the voting system , and call new elections .
More than 40@@ ,000 members of the security forces have been deployed to protect the government district .
At first , the demonstr@@ ators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament building . Then , at the weekend , Kh@@ an and Q@@ ad@@ ri called upon them to force entry into Sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
After its second win of the season , Hü@@ tt@@ el@@ dorf is in third place on the table .
A bitter week came to an end for Rap@@ id on Sunday with a 2 : 0 win over Grö@@ dig .
Co@@ ach Z@@ or@@ an Bar@@ is@@ ic , whose team reached an interim low at the end of the Europa League on Thursday , said that &quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating &quot; .
The cap@@ tain and go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper , St@@ eff@@ en Hof@@ mann , who clim@@ bed up to third place with Grün@@ -@@ Wei@@ ß , confirmed that &quot; the sense of achievement was extremely important &quot; .
Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el &apos;s dream goal has led Rap@@ id on to a road to victory . Two winning seasons show that Rap@@ id have re@@ acted in the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki , and they reach the end of the international season with hei@@ gh@@ tened mor@@ ale .
&quot; We wanted to show a positive reaction &quot; , the def@@ ender Thomas Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el said , whose magnificent and sk@@ ill@@ ful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course .
&quot; I thought I &apos;d build up all of the fru@@ stration from Thursday , and sm@@ ashed it into the top of the net &quot; , the 26@@ -@@ year old said sm@@ iling .
13th of November 2010 was , until now , the last time that Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el had sc@@ ored in a team from the Bundes@@ lig@@ a , and that was with Ri@@ ed .
His first champ@@ ion@@ ships goal at Rap@@ i@@ d-@@ D@@ ress will , therefore , always be a special memory for him .
&quot; That is something quite special for me , I am Rap@@ id off@@ spring &quot; , Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el said .
Due to Mario P@@ av@@ el@@ ic &apos;s recent pel@@ vis injury , Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el moved from playing left back to right back , where he also did a very good job .
He had enough experience to be able to play in the mir@@ r@@ ored position .
He deser@@ ved the goal , Bar@@ is@@ ic stated . He has already achieved some assi@@ sts this year .
The team shows character . Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el also cross@@ ed the ball over to Hof@@ mann after the first hour , which led to the decisive 2 : 0 victory .
But before that , even the fans could have kept the score .
&quot; Thank God we had some luck today &quot; , Sch@@ r@@ amm@@ el noted , all@@ u@@ ding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks : &quot; The results were not justified , but the games were always better when compared to last year &quot; .
Bar@@ is@@ ic even decided that the team had previously played &quot; better in other games than today &quot; , and against &quot; the strongest team to play in the stadium this season &quot; .
These are the first three points since 26@@ th July , and therefore prove that the structure of the team is int@@ act despite the set@@ backs : &quot; Today , my team has shown that they have character &quot; .
For him , what is just as pleas@@ ing is : &quot; The fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again &quot; .
A lot of work was done during the internal football break . The unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of Bri@@ an B@@ ehr@@ endt , Mario P@@ av@@ el@@ ic , Christop@@ her Di@@ bon , Den@@ i Al@@ ar and Michael Sch@@ imp@@ els@@ berger , as well as the fact that S@@ r@@ d@@ jan Gra@@ ho@@ vac , Stefan St@@ ang@@ l and Phili@@ pp Scho@@ bes@@ berger joined the first team , is what makes this success all the more valuable .
&quot; We must not forget that &quot; , Bar@@ is@@ ic said , who has lost players in the last three days , including B@@ ehr@@ endt and P@@ av@@ el@@ ic , &quot; who recently were very stable &quot; .
The international football break therefore has to be used &quot; to lick wo@@ unds and to improve physi@@ cally a bit &quot; , Bar@@ is@@ ic explained , who has five under 2@@ 1@@ s in his ranks .
For one of whom , cap@@ tain Hof@@ mann , the break came in particularly useful .
He b@@ ends over back@@ wards for the team , ign@@ oring any pain .
Especially during these difficult times , he showed that he is a very important player for us &quot; , Bar@@ is@@ ic stated .
Before being sub@@ stituted in the 68@@ th minute , Hof@@ mann not only gave structure to Rap@@ id &apos;s game , but also sc@@ ored the second goal .
For the 3@@ 3-@@ year old , who played his 3@@ 50@@ th game in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a , it was his first goal since November 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 against Admir@@ a ) .
Hof@@ mann : &quot; We must not think that all is now well &quot; . &quot; I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side , but , at some point , that luck had to come back to us .
It was high time &quot; , Hof@@ mann said .
Of course , he spoke about focused and continued work : &quot; You don &apos;t have to always see things black and white .
We haven &apos;t been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be .
However , we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t think that all is now well .
His importance to the team is something that he could not deny .
After all , it is a very young team , which , I am able to help at the moment .
They hold on to me in certain phases &quot; , Hof@@ mann said .
Grö@@ dig &apos;s coach , Michael Ba@@ ur and his team have little to blame themselves for .
He is sorry about the quick counter goal , descri@@ bing it as &quot; a kind of magic goal &quot; , as well as the normal goal sc@@ ored by N@@ utz in the 40@@ th minute , which was wron@@ g@@ fully denied by the refer@@ ee , Kolleg@@ ger .
The only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough up@@ field .
Because we had far to few goals .
Center back , Maxim@@ ili@@ an Kar@@ ner thought the same : &quot; It started off badly , but we then found our feet , and even sc@@ ored a goal .
All in all , we could have had more .
Sil@@ ence prev@@ ails ben@@ e@@ ath this tre@@ et@@ op
Last Friday , when giving out the pu@@ zzle on the summer series &quot; My piece of R@@ hö@@ n happiness &quot; , we showed a mi@@ ghty tree tr@@ unk .
There are still several of these giant trees in the region ; the example shown is the &quot; Gei@@ ss@@ ru@@ hei@@ che &quot; , an o@@ ak tree , which stands above the village of Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n .
A ro@@ cky foot@@ path leads up to the somewhat 600 year old o@@ ak tree .
You walk past en@@ clos@@ ures , bas@@ alt c@@ air@@ ns and a sea of stones .
The tree is located just below the Bau@@ ers@@ berg &apos;s stone quar@@ ry , one kilom@@ eter north of the street to Wei@@ s@@ bach .
The natural monument looks energe@@ tic ; it towers above the other trees in the area , and , being more than eight meters in size , it remin@@ ds you of an American giant Sequ@@ o@@ ia .
A small Budd@@ ha on top of a tree st@@ ub indicates that this is a spiritual or my@@ stic place .
Despite intensive research , there are only clu@@ es to the origins of the name .
Dr Wolfgang Schnei@@ der has , once again , consulted the Bisch@@ of@@ sh@@ eim Archi@@ ves , and asked elderly people from Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n in order to find out what it has to do with the Gei@@ ss@@ ru@@ hei@@ che .
The results of his investigation revealed a less color@@ ful explanation of the name .
According to his research , up to around 80 years ago , the go@@ at her@@ ders are said to have led their animals out of Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n along the ar@@ du@@ ous , clear@@ ed and st@@ on@@ eless mead@@ ows .
The her@@ d@@ s@@ men , exhau@@ sted after the as@@ cent , res@@ ted at the foot of the tree .
Since then , the area has won back its significance , because her@@ ds of go@@ ats , once again gra@@ zing the mead@@ ows .
In addition , Schnei@@ der also discovered that the region has been declared the core area in the bio@@ sphere reserve .
One should exercise caution when tre@@ ading over the mass of stone because the sun@@ -@@ war@@ med bas@@ alt is also a popular wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs for the European vi@@ per .
A hiking trail leads from Unter@@ weis@@ sen@@ brun@@ n up to the tree , but it is somewhat hidden .
Further trails are sign@@ posted , which lead up towards Hoch@@ r@@ hö@@ n and offer an extensive hi@@ ke .
Where is the mo@@ ated castle ?
A mo@@ ated castle , which we looked for as part of our next challenge , is , of course , rather hard to find way up high .
The reflection in the mo@@ at already provides a good impression of the structure , but we do have some historical buildings in the district , and the building portra@@ it may just be a good example of this .
Where is our &quot; piece of R@@ hö@@ n happiness &quot; ?

After weeks of verb@@ al w@@ ran@@ g@@ ling Italy &apos;s Premier - and sitting EU-@@ Chairman - Mat@@ te@@ o Ren@@ zi , has managed to push through his nom@@ ination of his foreign minister , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , as head of EU@@ - Foreign Policy , despite strong conservative opposition at the special EU summit . She will be the successor of the Britain , Ca@@ ther@@ ine Ashton .
Ren@@ zi ob@@ serves how the govern@@ ment-@@ friendly daily newspaper , La Repub@@ b@@ lica , describes the appointment of Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who was also seen as the favourite by the government , as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and of his own position in the EU .
He expects it to provide a boost for his &quot; Reform Package &quot; in Italy .
Ren@@ zi hopes , not least , to be able to thus qui@@ eten the left-@@ wing party basis which is always stir@@ ring against him , for Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini is considered to be one of their group - albeit one of the more moderate .
In opposition to the conservative representatives , Commission President Jean-@@ Claude Jun@@ cker and the P@@ ole Donald Tus@@ k , who was named as Council President , were voted in , so the prev@@ ailing opinion in Rome , in order to achieve a political balance .
For the Chief Diplom@@ at of the EU will also serve as the Dep@@ uty to Commission President Jun@@ cker .
The agreement of the EU-@@ Parliament is considered to be safely secured .
If this were not the case , then State President Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ polit@@ ano would hardly have called the nom@@ ination of the 41 year-old politi@@ cian from the ruling Democratic Party ( P@@ D ) &quot; an important recognition &quot; of the role of Italy in the EU .
La Repub@@ b@@ lica is optimistic that Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who has held high office over two decades in different governments , and who is known for her ambition , will be able to meet the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
The woman , who was born in Rome , is married and has two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
The qualified doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democ@@ rati@@ ci di S@@ ini@@ stra ( left wing democ@@ rats ) , which mer@@ ged with the ca@@ tho@@ lic centre party , Mar@@ gh@@ er@@ ita , in 2008 , to form today &apos;s social democratic party ( P@@ D ) .
In 1999 Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini became Vice President for three years of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth .
The election of 2001 saw her take high office with a place on the council of the Left W@@ ing Democrats , working in the foreign policy department and then becoming its head .
She was responsible for traditional cornerst@@ ones of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East ; became known for her preparatory work to the operation of NATO in Afghanistan , in which Italy has a participating cont@@ ingent ; and she promoted relations with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA .
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , in which she serves as an expert on Defence and European and International Affairs .
When Ren@@ zi became Premier in February 2014 , he appointed Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini as his Foreign Minister .
If the P@@ D today enjoys a better relationship with the strong freedom movement in the country , which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes for the Party in the EU elections , then it was Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini who played a leading role in that , as is strongly believed in P@@ D circles .
The claims in Brussels that the new EU-@@ Foreign Minister has too little diplomatic experience and therefore lacks cl@@ out , is re@@ but@@ ted by the P@@ D .
In Brussels , the realistic stance taken by Lo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini in the Ukrainian crisis have been attacked and den@@ i@@ gr@@ ated , particularly by the Polish members and those representing the Baltic States .
She is a suppor@@ ter of Pi@@ peline South Stream , run by the Russian firm Gas@@ pro@@ m , through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe , by-@@ passing Ukraine . This will also make Italy &apos;s own energy secure .
After Ren@@ zi had assumed his position as EU-@@ Chairman in July , Mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini embark@@ ed on her first state visit to Moscow .
Photos showing her sha@@ king hands with Putin were received in Brussels with indi@@ gn@@ ation , as was the fact that she invited the Krem@@ lin chief to an economic summit in Milan in October .
A total of nine people began their training course on Monday , at em@@ z-@@ Han@@ auer in N@@ ab@@ burg .
They include a train@@ ee , who had already completed another course in the same company .
The new train@@ ee employees will receive training for four future job areas : Electron@@ ics engineers ( three tra@@ ine@@ es ) ; me@@ chat@@ ron@@ ics engineers or techni@@ cians ( two ) ; tool mechan@@ ics ( two ) and process engineers ( two ) .
All the tra@@ ine@@ es come from the county of Sch@@ wand@@ or@@ f : To@@ bi@@ as Brau@@ n and Thomas Bü@@ cher@@ l from Schwarz@@ ach , Stefan Bri@@ ck@@ l and Flori@@ an Re@@ wi@@ tz@@ er from Sch@@ mid@@ g@@ aden , Johannes Be@@ er from Ne@@ un@@ burg vor@@ m Wald , Feli@@ x Dom@@ ai@@ er from Ober@@ vie@@ cht@@ ach , Daniel Sor@@ gen@@ frei and Sebastian Zah@@ ner from P@@ frei@@ m@@ d , as well as Fer@@ din@@ and Stre@@ b@@ l from Te@@ un@@ z .
The new tra@@ ine@@ es had previously attended middle and junior high schools .
From Wednesday until Friday , the tra@@ ine@@ es of all the various ages were going to a Team Building event in Ober@@ amm@@ erg@@ au , which included among other things an all-@@ day hi@@ ke and ra@@ fting on the Inn River .
The company has 4@@ 35 employees throughout Germany and 9@@ 50 worldwide .
The number of tra@@ ine@@ es across all age-@@ groups tot@@ als 27 .
France &apos;s Socialists should &apos; shut up and sort France out &apos; , Fran@@ co@@ is Holl@@ ande &apos;s key ally says
Mr V@@ alls called on the deeply divided Left to &quot; show its aff@@ ection &quot; for the emb@@ att@@ led Socialist president , whose res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French .
The president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ ality , he deserves our support .
&quot; It is our duty to remain at his sides , &quot; he said , to appl@@ ause .
As a plac@@ atory gest@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted his government would not call into question France &apos;s controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour working week , despite infl@@ amm@@ atory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Em@@ manu@@ el Mac@@ ron , the new economy minister .
On Saturday , Mr Holl@@ ande had impl@@ ored his fellow Socialists to remain &quot; united &quot; with the government .
But Christi@@ ane Tau@@ bir@@ a , the justice minister , put a sp@@ anner in the works by turning up to a meeting of re@@ bel Socialist MP@@ s and critic@@ ising the Socialist Party for letting the French &quot; lose faith in their future . &quot;
Marine Le P@@ en , the far-@@ Right National Front leader , he@@ ap@@ ed sc@@ orn on the Socialists &apos; constant in-@@ fighting by saying she did not see the new V@@ alls government lasting more than just a few months .
Fran@@ co@@ is Holl@@ ande the Emperor has no clothes , but neither has Prince Manuel V@@ alls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one didn &apos;t even survive the summer .
&quot; And the new one won &apos;t survive the fall or the winter either , &quot; Mis@@ s Le P@@ en told supporters .
She reiter@@ ated her party &apos;s call for a parliamentary dis@@ solution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to go@@ vern .
France &apos;s ruling party suffered a dru@@ b@@ bing in March municipal elections and the far-@@ right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May .
A pol@@ l in Sunday &apos;s Journal du Dim@@ anche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several ri@@ val fac@@ tions before the end of Mr Holl@@ ande &apos;s presidential term in 20@@ 17 .
Pas@@ cal Per@@ rin@@ eau , a political scienti@@ st at Sciences P@@ o university , warned the French would fast lose pati@@ ence unless the new Socialist government succ@@ eed@@ s in improving the economy and record unemployment .
&quot; It has a small window of opportunity , but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing , &quot; he warned .
Otherwise , the situation could further de@@ generate .
Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise ne@@ ars $ 3 billion Prestige Cru@@ ises deal
Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise Line Hol@@ dings Ltd N@@ CH@@ L@@ .@@ O , the world &apos;s third largest cru@@ ise operator , is in advanced talks to acquire pe@@ er Prestige Cru@@ ises International Inc for around $ 3 billion , according to people familiar with the matter .
A deal would give Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise , a company with a market value of $ 6.@@ 8 billion , access to Prestige Cru@@ ises &apos; luxury cru@@ ise ships and aff@@ lu@@ ent cli@@ ent@@ ele as it compet@@ es with bigger ri@@ vals Royal Caribbean Cru@@ ises Ltd ( R@@ CL@@ .@@ N ) and Car@@ ni@@ val Cor@@ p ( C@@ CL@@ .@@ N ) .
An agreement may be announced as early as this week , the sources said on Sunday , cau@@ tioning that the talks could still fall apart .
The owner of Prestige Cru@@ ises , private equity firm Ap@@ oll@@ o Global Management LL@@ C ( AP@@ O.@@ N ) , also owns a 20 percent stake in Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise .
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are not public .
Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise and Prestige Cru@@ ises representatives did not respond to requests for comment , while an Ap@@ oll@@ o spo@@ kes@@ man dec@@ lined to comment .
Mi@@ am@@ i-@@ based Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise operates 13 cru@@ ise ships in routes spann@@ ing North America , the Mediterranean , the Baltic , Central America and the Caribbean .
It had revenues of $ 2.@@ 57 billion in 2013 , up 13 percent from 2012 .
Prestige Cru@@ ises , also based in Mi@@ ami , operates under the Oc@@ e@@ ania and Reg@@ ent brands , which together have eight cru@@ ise ships traveling to Scandinavi@@ a , Russia , the Mediterranean , North America , Asia , Africa and South America .
It posted revenues of $ 1.2 billion in 2013 , up 6 percent from the year earlier .
The $ 29 billion cru@@ ise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India .
Companies are racing to position themselves as the cru@@ ise operators of choice for these new customers .
Prestige Cru@@ ises registered with U.S. regul@@ ators for an initial public offering in January 2014 .
Ap@@ oll@@ o has been the company &apos;s majority shar@@ eholder following an $ 8@@ 50 million deal in 2007 .
Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise was created in its current form in 2000 through a mer@@ ger with a cru@@ ise operator owned by G@@ enting B@@ h@@ d ( G@@ ENT@@ .@@ K@@ L ) , the leisure and casino con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate controlled by Malay@@ sian billi@@ on@@ aire L@@ im Ko@@ k Th@@ ay .
Ap@@ oll@@ o made a $ 1 billion investment in Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise in 2008 .
Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise went public in January 2013 .
G@@ enting had a 28 percent stake , Ap@@ oll@@ o had a 20 percent stake and private equity firm T@@ PG Capital L@@ P had an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June , according to a regulatory fil@@ ing .
Car@@ ni@@ val , Royal Caribbean Cru@@ ises and Norweg@@ ian Cru@@ ise together account for 82 percent of the North American cru@@ ise passenger ber@@ th capacity , according to Prestige Cru@@ ises &apos; initial public offering registration document .
Hong Kong pro-@@ democracy activists h@@ eck@@ le China official day after vote ruling
A group of Beijing loy@@ alists stood nearby w@@ aving China &apos;s flag .
The N@@ PC Stand@@ ing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong &apos;s 20@@ 17 leadership vote .
All candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nomin@@ ating committee likely to be st@@ ack@@ ed with Beijing loy@@ alists .
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democ@@ rats to get on the bal@@ lot promp@@ ted pro-@@ democracy activists to rene@@ w their v@@ ow to bring Hong Kong &apos;s financial hub to a halt with &quot; O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Central &quot; protests .
Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong , with China party leaders fear@@ ful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities .
Following the publication by Beijing of a white paper out@@ lining China &apos;s authority over Hong Kong in June , democracy activists held an un@@ official referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands mar@@ ched to the city &apos;s business district and st@@ aged a si@@ t-in .
L@@ i &apos;s brief@@ ing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and China &apos;s Li@@ aison Office in Hong Kong .
The vice chairman of the Stand@@ ing Committee &apos;s Legisl@@ ative Affairs Commission , Z@@ hang R@@ ong@@ sh@@ un , and the Dep@@ uty Director of the State Council &apos;s Hong Kong and Mac@@ au Affairs Office , F@@ eng W@@ ei , were also due to speak in a series of brief@@ ings throughout the day .
Stu@@ dent activists said they would gather outside of the Hong Kong chief executive &apos;s office in the afternoon .
Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule .
Putin demands K@@ iev open &apos; stat@@ eh@@ ood &apos; talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President V@@ ladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease batt@@ ling separ@@ ati@@ sts in the country &apos;s east and immediately begin negotiations on the break@@ away region &apos;s &quot; stat@@ eh@@ ood , &quot; according to Russian news accounts of his remarks .
His spo@@ kes@@ man , D@@ mit@@ ry Pes@@ ko@@ v , later clarified that Putin didn &apos;t mean to imp@@ ly that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separ@@ ati@@ st control would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russi@@ an-@@ speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
But Putin &apos;s call upon the K@@ iev government to negotiate with the pro-@@ Russia ins@@ urg@@ ents as equ@@ als correspon@@ ded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : Help the separ@@ ati@@ sts take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proc@@ laimed No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ya region virtual independence to al@@ ign with Russia instead of the West .
In an interview with state-@@ run Channel One television , Putin den@@ ounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held territory in the eastern Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k regions that were sei@@ zed in March and April , after Moscow ann@@ ex@@ ed Ukraine &apos;s Cri@@ mean peninsula on March 18 .
The Krem@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have lat@@ ely br@@ anded the sei@@ zed territory &quot; No@@ vor@@ o@@ ssi@@ ya , &quot; or &quot; New Russia , &quot; a term that h@@ ark@@ ens to pre-@@ revolutionary gl@@ ory days of the Russian empire .
Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the off@@ ing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oc@@ t@@ . 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are att@@ acking civilian communities in separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held regions is &quot; a pris@@ oner to illu@@ sions , &quot; It@@ ar@@ -T@@ ass reported .
&quot; We must immediately comm@@ ence substan@@ tive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the stat@@ eh@@ ood status of sou@@ theast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , &quot; he said .
Pes@@ ko@@ v said Putin &apos;s reference to stat@@ eh@@ ood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the K@@ iev leadership as it stru@@ gg@@ les to all@@ ay fears in the Russi@@ an-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Pes@@ ko@@ v said .
It &apos;s not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia , Pes@@ ko@@ v said , &quot; because it &apos;s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but an internal Ukrainian conflict . &quot;
The Krem@@ lin spo@@ kes@@ man &apos;s inter@@ c@@ ession to correct the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of Putin &apos;s remarks under@@ sc@@ ored the Russian leadership &apos;s approach to dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east differently from its ou@@ tri@@ ght sei@@ z@@ ure of Cri@@ me@@ a , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian .
Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to ann@@ ex even the Don@@ et@@ sk and Lu@@ h@@ ans@@ k regions of eastern Ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million residents are not Russian and pre-@@ conflict poll@@ s showed broad support for staying within Ukraine .
The autonomy that Russian diplom@@ ats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively hand@@ ing the Krem@@ lin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian main@@ land with Cri@@ me@@ a .
The Black Sea peninsula ann@@ ex@@ ed five months ago is home to Russia &apos;s main nav@@ al fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts .
The regions between Russia &apos;s Ro@@ sto@@ v area and Cri@@ me@@ a are also home to mines , factories and found@@ ries that produce vital components for the Russian military .
Ukrainian President Pet@@ ro Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko proposed during his inau@@ gur@@ ation speech on June 7 that Ukrainian law@@ makers - after new elections -- wei@@ gh constitutional amendments to give more control to the di@@ spar@@ ate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharp@@ ly from that of the Krem@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bels Moscow is accused of arming and ins@@ tig@@ ating .
Putin &apos;s latest call on K@@ iev to deal with the separ@@ ati@@ st leaders as equ@@ als followed new advances by the re@@ bels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of A@@ zo@@ v .
The Russi@@ an-@@ backed separ@@ ati@@ sts took control of the town of No@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to sei@@ ze the strategic coastal territory all the way to Cri@@ me@@ a .
That has sp@@ urred a massive civilian and military effort to forti@@ fy Mari@@ u@@ pol , a ste@@ el@@ making port of 500@@ ,000 that lies between No@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk and the narrow g@@ ateway into the Cri@@ mean peninsula .
Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggres@@ sion against Ukraine , a former Soviet re@@ public that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; We are close to the point of no return , &quot; Por@@ o@@ sh@@ enko warned .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine .
The EU summit took no definitive action ; the leaders called for drafting more pun@@ ishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an un@@ specified escal@@ ation of the Ukraine crisis .
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in I@@ lov@@ ay@@ sk after two columns of Russian arm@@ or and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Don@@ et@@ sk region to bol@@ ster the bel@@ e@@ agu@@ ered separ@@ ati@@ sts , Col@@ . An@@ dri@@ y Ly@@ sen@@ ko , spo@@ kes@@ man for the Ukrainian National Security and Def@@ ense Council , told re@@ por@@ ters in K@@ iev on Saturday .
The first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were tra@@ pped in I@@ lov@@ ay@@ sk by the Russian inc@@ ur@@ sion were sw@@ apped Sunday for 10 Russian par@@ atro@@ op@@ ers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago , Ly@@ sen@@ ko said Sunday .

Ge@@ off@@ rey Edel@@ sten has v@@ ented his dis@@ g@@ ust at h@@ ack@@ ers who may have st@@ olen nu@@ de images of fi@@ anc@@ ee Gab@@ i Gre@@ ck@@ o and a who &apos;s who of Hollywood A-@@ li@@ sters .
Tin@@ sel@@ town is re@@ eling after a series of explicit photos showing a nu@@ de J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence hit the internet in a major celebr@@ ity h@@ acking scandal .
The h@@ ack@@ er responsible is said to have 60 nu@@ de photos of Hunger Games star La@@ wr@@ ence and super@@ stars including models K@@ ate U@@ pt@@ on and Car@@ a Del@@ ev@@ ing@@ ne , sing@@ ers R@@ ih@@ anna , Ari@@ ana Grande and Le@@ a Mich@@ elle and actors Kir@@ sten Dun@@ st .

There are 101 celebr@@ ity names on the list .
Edel@@ sten , who proposed to Gre@@ ck@@ o last month , told Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al : &quot; It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting &quot; .
All private correspon@@ dence and images should remain private .
It &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ceful that personal information can be st@@ olen and disp@@ er@@ sed to others .
Gre@@ ck@@ o , who is in New York , report@@ edly told a news website the h@@ acking was &quot; sham@@ eful &quot; and those targeted would &quot; feel violated . &quot;
The h@@ ack@@ er is believed to have 30 images of Pal@@ mer with ex-@@ boy@@ friend Scott Spe@@ ed@@ man , including two frames where she is lo@@ ung@@ ing top@@ less in a pool .
Pal@@ mer &apos;s film credits include Love And Hon@@ or , opposite Li@@ am Hem@@ s@@ worth .
Pal@@ mer , Ch@@ u@@ ck star Stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and Su@@ cker P@@ unch act@@ ress Brow@@ ning yesterday had no comment on the h@@ ack@@ ed pictures .
A representative for La@@ wr@@ ence told T@@ M@@ Z : &quot; This is a flag@@ rant violation of privacy . &quot;
Ac@@ tor Se@@ th Ro@@ gen las@@ hed out at the h@@ ack@@ er , t@@ we@@ eting : &quot; Po@@ sting pic@@ s h@@ ack@@ ed from a cell phone is really no different than selling st@@ olen merchan@@ di@@ se . &quot;

Cy@@ cli@@ sts , j@@ og@@ gers and wal@@ kers took part yesterday in the 8th Cy@@ cling Event on the Gro@@ sser Feld@@ berg mountain , giving their support to &apos; Help for Children with Canc@@ er &apos; .
The Tour was a hard gr@@ ind for some , while others treated it as a light training session .
However , everyone agreed on one thing : It was a lot of fun .
Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski must have sle@@ pt well last night .
For the very first time in his life the head of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel Bre@@ wer@@ y took his bike up the Feld@@ berg .
And for a good cause .
He can put up with a little mus@@ cle sti@@ ff@@ ness , especially since his participation in the 8th Cy@@ cling Event on the Gro@@ sser Fel@@ berg was in aid of the &apos; Help for children with cancer &apos; association , and gave him a valuable personal insight .
A great thing .
&quot; I now know that I can do it - brilliant ! &quot;
You didn &apos;t happen to have a little break to milk the appl@@ ause ?
No , if I &apos;d stopped , I &apos;d never have been able to carry on ...
Like Thomas Stu@@ dan@@ ski , a member for the CD@@ U in the Ober@@ ur@@ sel town council , many of the 7@@ 18 participants stru@@ gg@@ led in the early mountain de@@ w , coming close to exhaus@@ tion , but arriving happ@@ ily on top of the summit plat@@ eau .
On the other hand , some others found it much easier to complete the full el@@ even kilomet@@ re route between Hoh@@ emark and Feld@@ berg .
Nor@@ man Di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
The Green Poli@@ ti@@ cian , wearing all red , from the municipal council - red clothes , red bike - looked to be taking it g@@ ently ( &quot; Qu@@ it some professionals here , so it &apos;s all about finishing ! &quot; ) - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without p@@ aus@@ ing for bre@@ ath .
He was another one who did it all in one go , as did N@@ ina Ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ person for the Ober@@ ur@@ sel Council , who did the route along side Frank Grün@@ ei@@ sen .
For both the tri@@ ath@@ letes the &quot; Feld@@ berg Cy@@ cling Event &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; This one is about char@@ ity , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re glad to be here - we &apos;d have gone out riding anyway today , &quot; Ku@@ hn said .
Along the route they met up with Paul W@@ enz@@ el from Ober@@ rei@@ fen@@ berg .
The boy ( 12 ) had driven down to Ober@@ us@@ el in the morning , only to immediately go back up again .
Flori@@ an Z@@ ier@@ z from Frankfurt got himself into the s@@ add@@ le at 9 am ; he &quot; did &quot; the Feld@@ berg twice , before then whe@@ eling back home .
Another one who enjoyed himself was &quot; Fr@@ itt@@ en-@@ T@@ oni &quot; .
For the manager of the Ober@@ ur@@ sel cul@@ t ki@@ os@@ k , taking part in cycling events which go over the Feld@@ berg is perfectly natural .
He took just 40 minutes to do the route with his 6.@@ 5-@@ k@@ il@@ o racing bike .
A mad event .
For this cause I &apos;m very glad to be here , &quot; comm@@ ented Andreas Bal@@ z@@ ke .
The well-@@ conditioned man from Main@@ z said he was an &quot; ambitious racing cy@@ cli@@ st . &quot;
And he must be , since he was riding a &quot; Fix@@ ie-@@ Bike &quot; which is a bike without ge@@ ars ...
But it wasn &apos;t only cy@@ cli@@ sts who ja@@ un@@ ted to the top - as was evi@@ den@@ ced not only by the 20 wal@@ kers , who clim@@ bed up via the White Wall and the Fu@@ ch@@ stanz , but also by a j@@ og@@ ger who pul@@ led behind him a ty@@ re with wei@@ ghts attached to him by a ro@@ pe .
Mountain Res@@ cu@@ e doctor , Professor Vol@@ ker L@@ isch@@ ke , who was there with his team to provide safety , and who was equipped with a four-@@ wheel Bul@@ ly and Qu@@ ad , said : &quot; I know him from Frankfurt - he trains for a specialist s@@ lei@@ gh trail - it &apos;s just that he pul@@ ls the s@@ lei@@ gh himself . &quot; The man is , therefore , in a sense his own s@@ lei@@ gh dog .
The 7@@ 18 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning .
The wal@@ kers started at 9.@@ 30 am .
Then it was the turn of the cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners , who began at 10 am .
Five minutes later the first Mountain@@ -@@ bi@@ kers set off .
B@@ ent Han@@ sen , Chairman of the Association &apos; Cy@@ cling on the Gro@@ sser Feld@@ berg &apos; gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjoyable trip .
Next year , he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the Feld@@ berg .
