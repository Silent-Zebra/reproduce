Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo , Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize , the fourth American president in history to do so .
He will receive a diplom@@ a , med@@ al and che@@ que for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation , amongst other things .
The head of the White House will be flying into the Norweg@@ ian city in the morning with his wife Mich@@ elle and will have a busy schedule .
First , he will visit the Nobel Institute , where he will have his first meeting with the five committee members who selected him from 17@@ 2 people and 33 organisations .
The presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with King Har@@ ald V and Queen Son@@ ja of Norway .
Then , in the afternoon , the visit will cul@@ min@@ ate in a grand ceremony , at which Obama will receive the prestigious award .
He will be the fourth American president to be awarded the prize , and only the third to have received it while actually in office .
The White House has stated that , when he accepts the prize , Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan .
The president does not want to sk@@ ir@@ t around this topic , as he realis@@ es that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries .
A few days ago he step@@ ped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan , something that his critics will be stres@@ sing .
At the ceremony , Obama will also be given a gold med@@ al , a diplom@@ a , and a che@@ que for ten million Swedish k@@ ron@@ a ( around 24 million Czech crow@@ ns ) .
He intends to don@@ ate this money to char@@ ity , but has@@ n &apos;t decided which yet .
Their busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a ban@@ quet , which will be attended by the Norweg@@ ian king and qu@@ een as well as the minist@@ erial chairman and another 250 invited guests .
Obama has always been re@@ tic@@ ent in regards to his prize .
He has said , for example , that he feels that he does not wholly deserve it .
He has repeatedly said that the prize isn &apos;t for him , but for everyone who uph@@ ol@@ ds the same values .
Right after hearing about it , he described it as a &quot; challenge to take action . &quot;
Nature protection officers accused of black@@ mail
The Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice police have accused the chairman of the Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice Nature Protection Society civil association of black@@ mail .
Several times during the last year he appe@@ aled against certain building permit proceedings , and has then claimed money from investors for re@@ trac@@ ting the appeal , said Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice police spo@@ kes@@ woman Al@@ ena Rom@@ ov@@ á .
The chairman of the Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice Nature Protection Society is L@@ ub@@ om@@ í@@ r Stu@@ d@@ ni@@ č@@ ka .
He is now under arrest and faces up to three years in prison .
Recy@@ cling containers don &apos;t smell so good in Br@@ no
In Prague , normal people can sort their be@@ verage bott@@ les , and , in South Mor@@ avi@@ an , villages are recycling containers on every corner .
And in Br@@ no ?
There , it will take you a good few minutes to find the right sort of bin .
I don &apos;t mean to imp@@ ly that gar@@ b@@ age isn &apos;t sor@@ ted in Br@@ no .
But it seems to me that considering we &apos;re the second largest city in the country , the authorities are not showing enough interest in this problem .
Br@@ no is falling way behind in its gar@@ b@@ age sor@@ ting , not only because people here can still only put paper , glass and plastic into these bin@@ s , but mostly because of the she@@ er lack of containers for this kind of waste .
Have you ever tried thro@@ wing a plastic bottle into a bin in the city centre ?
It &apos;s a real art form , and you need time and steady ner@@ ves .
The only place we &apos;ve managed to come across is on Mor@@ av@@ sk@@ é n@@ á@@ m@@ ě@@ st@@ í , opposite the Pot@@ ref@@ en@@ á Hus@@ a .
No off@@ ence to Mr. On@@ der@@ ka and his colleagues , but it &apos;s really not good enough .
Not to mention that it &apos;s no easy task sor@@ ting gar@@ b@@ age in other parts of the city .
Pl@@ enty of my friends don &apos;t bo@@ ther sor@@ ting their gar@@ b@@ age .
Out of la@@ zin@@ ess .
It &apos;s just too far to the bin , you see .
I don &apos;t blame them .
After a party , I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bott@@ les .
But , on Ko@@ unic@@ ova uli@@ ce , there were no coloured bin@@ s to be seen .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily , on the way to the tram , I found the right place .
But it was over@@ f@@ lowing with gar@@ b@@ age .
Come on , this is the centre of Br@@ no . Is@@ n &apos;t it supposed to look good ?
It should , but ec@@ ology and aes@@ the@@ tics don &apos;t seem to interest the Br@@ no soci@@ alists much .
They prefer to buy the city a new ho@@ ck@@ ey extra@@ -@@ leag@@ ue , which puts us to shame all over the country , instead of buying a few more containers and letting us sort other gar@@ b@@ age for a clean@@ er Br@@ no .
I &apos;m glad to see that , after brow@@ sing the net for a while , my assu@@ mp@@ tions are confirmed by official statistics .
Fig@@ ures published by EK@@ O-@@ KOM show that Br@@ no really is the worst off in the whole of South Mor@@ avi@@ a .
&quot; Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k &apos;s &quot; budget takes money for pensions and sick pay
The fact that the left gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions , sick pay , or building society savings .
And also not enough for interest on the national debt or to cover international judicial disputes .
This will bring problems for wh@@ o@@ ever is in office in the latter half of next year , said the Finance Minister E@@ du@@ ard Jan@@ ota .
When the social democ@@ rats and commun@@ ists raised interest rates for certain groups , they were rel@@ ying on the fact that the government would loan money for sus@@ cep@@ tible expenses , pensions , and sick pay . &quot; It &apos;s just a case of postp@@ oning the problem , laying a min@@ e@@ field , &quot; says Jan@@ ota .
High@@ er interest has to be paid on lo@@ an@@ ed money , and , at some point , it has to be paid back .
The state does not have much choice where to find it .
If it doesn &apos;t reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state , it will have to increase taxes .
For all those that the left just handed out money to : fire@@ figh@@ ters , teachers , farmers .
And later , their children , too .
People don &apos;t have to worry about pensions or sick pay , where 1.@@ 8 billion has disappeared from the accounts ; they &apos;ll get them .
Although , at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt – next year the treas@@ ury won &apos;t just be 16@@ 3 billion short , but even more .
Despite the efforts of Minister Jan@@ ota , debt will continue to increase at an ever faster rate , as will interest costs .
The state will need money to cover it , and it &apos;s no longer enough just to slightly b@@ ump up V@@ AT@@ s or reduce mat@@ ernity benefits , as the government has done in its anti-@@ deficit package .
As money has been diver@@ ted to several groups of voters , next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building high@@ ways and railways .
These are mostly sections that have been ten@@ dered out and are half-@@ finished and cannot be re@@ designed or made any cheaper .
At the most , con@@ serve what isn &apos;t free too .
This means that del@@ aying or hal@@ ting thirty major building projects and money from European funds is also at risk , war@@ ns transport mini@@ stry spo@@ kes@@ man Karel Han@@ zel@@ ka .
The Č@@ SS@@ D has suggested that the deficit be resolved Sol@@ om@@ on-@@ style – it should draw on Č@@ E@@ Z divi@@ den@@ ds , which are mostly state-@@ owned , and use those to top up the transport fund .
The problem is that the level of these divi@@ den@@ ds is never certain , and they are certainly not a bot@@ tom@@ less resource .
Last year , 18 billion of Č@@ E@@ Z money went into the budget .
Every year , these divi@@ den@@ ds are used to pay for cle@@ aring up ecological damage , t@@ opping up the pensions account , or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms .
Moreover , according to EU regulations , this tri@@ ck increases the actual budget deficit to 5.@@ 7 percent of GDP .
But this is not the end of these transfers .
The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of commun@@ ism and crime , to meet the cost of judicial disputes , and even to cover building society savings .
It is still not clear if the state can get by without this money .
It &apos;s a gam@@ ble .
If we were to lose an international dispute , we &apos;d still have to pay , claims Jan@@ ota .
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or , in the worst case scenario , reach into the government &apos;s budget reserve .
The two-@@ billi@@ on-@@ cro@@ wn State Treas@@ ury project , which is already under@@ way , is also lacking a hundred million , and what each office is spending can be followed on-line .
The first stage will start in January .
If the finance minister can &apos;t find the money elsewhere , the project will have to be abor@@ ted and sanctions will be imposed , war@@ ns Jan@@ ota .
Your next sm@@ art@@ phone will run two operating systems
The Americans are saying that , in the future , users will be able to switch between different operating systems on their mobile phones at the touch of a button .
The plans revealed so far look promising .
Just press one key and in just a few seconds you can switch from Windows Mobile to Andro@@ id .
This is the goal of the American company V@@ mware , which primarily develops computer virtu@@ alisation software .
This will let you have two user profiles at once on the same phone .
You can switch between them or have one for work and one for home .
Both of them will run at the same time , says S@@ rin@@ i@@ vas Kris@@ h@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti of V@@ M@@ ware in an interview with Computer World magazine .
It was presented last November and first demonstrated just a few days ago .
It will go on sale in 2012 .
The virtu@@ alisation of sm@@ art@@ phones is not science fiction .
V@@ M@@ ware has already given re@@ por@@ ters a demonstration of a sm@@ art@@ phone with two operating systems .
It was a modified N@@ 800 with 128 MB of RAM , running Windows Mobile and Andro@@ id at the same time .
The development of new mobile phone technology is in full s@@ wing .
V@@ M@@ ware is now working with European and American operators to test sm@@ art@@ phone virtu@@ alisation and the sets should reach customers some@@ time during 2012 .
L@@ ack of snow in mountains causes problems for hot@@ eli@@ ers
It &apos;s not only Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e ski@@ -@@ lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes .
The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses .
This means vac@@ ancies are still available in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e throughout the winter , including Christmas and New Year &apos;s E@@ ve .
We &apos;re getting plenty of visitors to our site .
People are brow@@ sing the offers , checking prices , but , so far , are worried about making a definite booking .
&quot; When they call , the first thing they ask is if we think they &apos;ll see snow or mu@@ d , &quot; says Martin J@@ and@@ ura , who runs the Sp@@ ind@@ l@@ .@@ Info information web site .
Anyone who wants to spend New Year &apos;s E@@ ve in Š@@ p@@ ind@@ ler@@ ů@@ v M@@ l@@ ý@@ n just how they want , had better start thinking about booking soon .
Those prefer@@ ring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days .
Hot@@ eli@@ ers in Š@@ p@@ ind@@ ler@@ ů@@ v M@@ l@@ ý@@ n are so far just offering week@@ -@@ long stays for New Year &apos;s E@@ ve .
I think they &apos;ll try to keep that up for a while , but even they will give in and offer shorter stays .
Then there &apos;ll be a sudden shortage of vac@@ ancies , &quot; estimates J@@ and@@ ura .
The V@@ r@@ ch@@ lab@@ í travel agency In@@ g@@ tours is still offering vac@@ ancies throughout the winter .
What we ’ re interested in is Christmas week , which has@@ n &apos;t sold out yet .
Hal@@ f of our capacity is still available .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve been preparing some cheaper la@@ st-@@ minute Christmas breaks , &quot; said In@@ g@@ tours director Pet@@ r Schi@@ ef@@ ert .
The V@@ r@@ ch@@ lab@@ í travel agency can still offer New Year &apos;s E@@ ve in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e , but there are fewer vac@@ ancies .
Another good time for bookings is the first fort@@ night in February , although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average .
This year , interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e .
People are waiting to see if any falls .
Nob@@ ody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there &apos;s no snow .
If snow falls on the slopes this week , Christmas will sell out too , &quot; says Schi@@ ef@@ ert .
On the other hand , the Horiz@@ ont Hotel in P@@ ec po@@ d Sn@@ ě@@ ž@@ k@@ ou has seen better bookings this year than last year .
We &apos;re up about 5 percent .
We have the last few vac@@ ancies for New Year &apos;s E@@ ve and Christmas .
There &apos;s a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too , &quot; explains the director of the best hotel in P@@ ec , Karel R@@ ada .
The Om@@ nia Hotel , by the central car park in Jan@@ sk@@ é L@@ á@@ zn@@ ě , is ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ percent booked up for New Year &apos;s E@@ ve .
Yet the newest hotel in Jan@@ sk@@ é L@@ á@@ zn@@ ě still has half its beds free for Christmas .
January this year has been a nice surprise , as we &apos;re already six@@ ty-@@ percent booked up .
So February isn &apos;t looking quite so good , but as soon as it s@@ no@@ ws , then interest in staying in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e will definitely rise , says the owner of the Om@@ nia Hotel , Eri@@ k Spor@@ y@@ sch .
For now , however , the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ š@@ e hot@@ eli@@ ers will have to wait for heavi@@ er falls of snow .
Col@@ der weather is forecast for Thursday , so if anything falls , it should be snow .
But it should get war@@ mer again after that , said Ji@@ ř@@ í Jak@@ ub@@ sk@@ ý of the Czech Hydro@@ met@@ e@@ or@@ ological Institute in H@@ ra@@ dec .
USA : Rep@@ e@@ ti@@ tion is the mother of wisdom
It &apos;s almost f@@ unny to see how Barack Obama , rep@@ ut@@ edly the wis@@ est president , is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor , having himself considered him to be the most foo@@ lish .
When he finally came out with his long-@@ awa@@ ited Afghan doctr@@ ine , it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush &apos;s Iraq scenario three years earlier .
It &apos;s not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words &quot; just like in Iraq &quot; , but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush &apos;s declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration : &quot; The new way forward &quot; .
While three years ago he himself criticised Bush &apos;s idea to send fresh troops to help in the bel@@ e@@ agu@@ ered civil war in Iraq as &quot; an irresponsible decision with catastro@@ phi@@ c consequences &quot; .
The following months , however , showed that Bush &apos;s strategy , which was recommended by his field comm@@ anders , was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq .
It didn &apos;t help Bush &apos;s reputation , but in objective terms , it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected .
Barack Obama hopes that , in Afghanistan , the mi@@ racle will repeat itself .
He was again asked to increase the military cont@@ ingent by his field comm@@ anders , particularly the su@@ preme comm@@ ander of the Afghan operation General Stan@@ ley Mc@@ Chr@@ yst@@ al , who even went against the custom of his sub@@ ordin@@ ates to har@@ sh@@ ly critic@@ ise the reluc@@ tant g@@ unn@@ ers in the White House .
He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around .
The president hes@@ it@@ ated for three months , but failed to come up with anything better , and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers .
He managed to squ@@ ee@@ ze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand , even though he himself was originally counting on 10 .
The tri@@ ck@@ i@@ est aspect of Obama &apos;s strategy seems to be his plan to start pul@@ ling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years . Obama &apos;s doctr@@ ine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers .
Many doubt that this half-@@ hear@@ ted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq .
Despite the intern@@ ec@@ ine war of recent years , Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been hon@@ our@@ ing the treaties .
The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be reli@@ ed upon and no treaties are being uph@@ eld .
In these conditions , it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare , being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves .
Political institutions , no matter how formally they might be set up , will be nothing more than a Pot@@ em@@ kin village in which patri@@ arch@@ al tri@@ bal relations will run wild .
Bal@@ ancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is un@@ usually difficult due to the tri@@ cky relations between them , a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran .
Even building an &quot; operational state &quot; , which is the most basic aim of the entire operation , does not seem particularly feasible .
The timing of Obama &apos;s strategy is fo@@ iled by his vol@@ un@@ tar@@ ism .
Over the last eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse , and is now on the ver@@ ge of explo@@ ding .
Only a truly romantic soul , totally un@@ affected by reality , could believe that the soldiers sent into the tur@@ mo@@ il of this war for an &quot; early return home &quot; will bring about any mi@@ rac@@ les here .
From a political view@@ po@@ in , t it is pure ir@@ responsibility setting a date for with@@ drawing the troops , as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowled@@ gement of an American defeat .
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is w@@ aning .
European politicians cannot and are un@@ willing to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foo@@ th@@ ills of the Hindu K@@ ush .
Another factor which could radic@@ ally sti@@ r things up is what is going on around Iran .
If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect , the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not .
This will need answer@@ ing when , according to Obama , America orders the vic@@ t@@ orious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan .
Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turn@@ around in the Afghan situation .
The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections , so there &apos;s still enough time for him to come up with another strateg@@ y@@ if this one turns out to be a total wh@@ it@@ ew@@ ash .
Man@@ agers at Gold@@ man Sach@@ s no longer to receive cash bon@@ uses
The top management of the American bank Gold@@ man Sach@@ s will not receive their bon@@ uses in cash this year .
The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their sal@@ ary policies .
Instead of money , the group of 30 top managers will receive shares , which cannot be sold for another five years .
The shares can also be conf@@ isc@@ ated if the managers take excessive risks .
According to R@@ eu@@ ters , Gold@@ man Sach@@ s is leading the effort to link Wall Street bon@@ uses with long-term performance .
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take , said former investment ban@@ ker for JP@@ Morgan , Dou@@ glas El@@ li@@ ott .
The problem lies in the details , he added .
Gold@@ man Sach@@ sh@@ as been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars ( almost 300 billion crow@@ ns ) for bon@@ uses in the first three quarters of this year .
R@@ eu@@ ters claims that the total bon@@ uses awarded by the business this year , despite today &apos;s announcement , exceed@@ s 20 billion dollars .
High bon@@ uses in the banking sector , what with the economic crisis , have become a political hot pot@@ ato .
On Wednesday , Britain announced that it had decided to charge a one-@@ off fif@@ ty percent tax rate on ban@@ kers &apos; bon@@ uses exceed@@ ing 25@@ ,000 po@@ unds ( around 7@@ 12@@ ,000 C@@ Z@@ K ) .
France is preparing similar measures .
This year , women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physi@@ cs
In Stockholm today , a record five women received Nobel Pri@@ zes from the Swedish king Carl X@@ VI Gu@@ sta@@ f in the professional categories and for literature .
In addition to four scientists , they also included the German writer Her@@ ta Müller , originally from Romania .
The Nobel Prize for medicine went to two American bi@@ ologists , Eli@@ zab@@ eth Black@@ burn and C@@ aro@@ l G@@ rei@@ der , together with their fellow country@@ man Jack S@@ zo@@ sta@@ k , for their research in ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es .
The prize for chem@@ istry was won by the Israeli A@@ da Jon@@ ath , together with the Americans V@@ enk@@ at@@ ram@@ an Ram@@ ak@@ ris@@ hn@@ an and Thomas Stei@@ tz , for their work to clarify the structure and function of ri@@ bo@@ som@@ es .
The last award was the Nobel Prize for Econom@@ ics , which went to the Americans E@@ lin@@ or Ost@@ rom and Oliver Willi@@ am@@ son for their analysis of economic management .
The only specialised category which nobody won this year was physi@@ cs .
Today , this prize was won by the scientists Charles Ka@@ o , for his research in optical fi@@ bres , and George Smith and Will@@ ard Bo@@ yle , for inv@@ enting the C@@ CD ship , which is the basis for all digital cameras , fa@@ xes , and astronom@@ ical tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
All the winners received a diplom@@ a , the Nobel Med@@ al , and a certificate for a monetary reward .
In each category , this award tot@@ als ten million Swedish k@@ ron@@ a ( approximately 25 million C@@ Z@@ K ) .
If there are multiple winners , they share the prize money between them .
Tradi@@ tionally , the most high@@ ly-@@ anticipated award , the Nobel Peace Prize , went to the American president Barack Obama in the Norweg@@ ian city of Oslo this afternoon .
In his speech , he acknowledged that the award was controversial , as he is just starting out in office and , moreover , heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan .
In defence of his policy he added , however , that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace , despite the high cost .
Minister Jan@@ ota considers resign@@ ation . Klaus invites him to the Castle
On Friday morning , President V@@ á@@ cla@@ v Klaus will meet with the finance minister E@@ du@@ ard Jan@@ ota , who is considering resign@@ ing as he does not agree with the government &apos;s budget for next year as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
It is assumed that the budget and also Jan@@ ota &apos;s possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday &apos;s meeting .
The budget has also been criticised by Klaus .
He claims the deficit is too high , which is wor@@ sen@@ ing the public funding crisis .
The meeting was announced by the president &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man Radi@@ m O@@ ch@@ v@@ at .
Jan@@ ota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister , Jan Fischer .
According to the Budget Act , which Klaus is due to sign , the Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 16@@ 3 billion crow@@ ns .
However , on Wednesday , the House approved the left &apos;s proposals to transfer funds , gave state employees a pay rise , and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers .
The government criticised the social democ@@ rats &apos; proposals , saying that they will sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously increase the budget deficit .
A bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand , and the government , Klaus , and the right on the other , leading to questions about the future of Fischer &apos;s interim government , which was agreed on in spring by the O@@ DS , Č@@ SS@@ D and Green Party .
Cri@@ tics claim that the budget , as approved by the House , essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by Fischer &apos;s government in autumn and which it believes should stop the state falling deeper into debt .
At a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today , Klaus , who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it , declared that politicians have long been negl@@ ecting a &quot; serious problem , &quot; which is the &quot; un@@ sustainable deficit level &quot; of public finances .
Now , he claims , there is no good solution to this .
The only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties , the president says .
O@@ DS chairman Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should re@@ think continuing in office .
The vic@@ e-@@ chairman of the O@@ DS , Pet@@ r Ne@@ č@@ as , told Č@@ T@@ K that the concept of an interim government supported by the Č@@ SS@@ D , O@@ DS , and the Green Party is evi@@ dently no longer working .
In response to this , Premier Fischer described this statement as &quot; strong words . &quot;
The head of the Č@@ SS@@ D , Ji@@ ř@@ í Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k , re@@ acted to Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget prepared by the former Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k government for this year , which exceed@@ s 200 billion crow@@ ns .
On Wednesday the Č@@ SS@@ D declared the approval of next year &apos;s budget to be a success .
The People &apos;s Party was also satisfied .
Mand@@ ela played by Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an in Clin@@ t E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s new film
South Afri@@ cans claim that the new Hollywood film In@@ vic@@ tus will tell the world a lot about their country , its struggle and its vic@@ tories , despite some people critic@@ ising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors .
It is a story about sport , race relations , and N@@ elson Mand@@ ela .
The life of the ti@@ rel@@ ess figh@@ ter against the rac@@ ist system of apar@@ thei@@ d in South Africa and its first black president , N@@ elson Mand@@ ela , is played by the Os@@ car@@ -@@ winning American actor Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an .
Fre@@ em@@ an said that he had asked nin@@ et@@ y-@@ one-@@ year-old Mand@@ ela if he could play him in E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s film .
Another leading role in the film is played by Mat@@ t Dam@@ on .
I told him : &apos; If I &apos;m going to play you , I &apos;ll need access to you &quot; .
The s@@ event@@ y-@@ two-@@ year-old actor , who won an O@@ scar for his role in E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s box@@ ing drama Million Dollar Baby , has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-@@ sla@@ very movement who eventually himself became a slave , a fic@@ ti@@ tious president of the USA , and even a go@@ d in E@@ van Al@@ mi@@ ghty , but has only rarely portra@@ yed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mand@@ ela .
The former South African stat@@ es@@ man spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apar@@ thei@@ d in South Africa .
He was released in 1990 and was then the country &apos;s president for four years .
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
In@@ vic@@ tus is Latin for &apos; un@@ con@@ qu@@ ered &apos; and is the name of a po@@ em by the English writer William Ern@@ est Hen@@ ley , published in 18@@ 75 .
The challenge was to speak like he does .
The film tells the true story of how N@@ elson Mand@@ ela joined forces with the cap@@ tain of the South African rug@@ by team , Fran@@ co@@ is Pi@@ en@@ aar , to help uni@@ fy the country . The new@@ ly-@@ elected President Mand@@ ela knows that , after apar@@ thei@@ d , his nation will still be ra@@ cially and economically divided .
He believes that he can unite people through sport , so he decides to unite the rug@@ by players who , to the world , are out@@ si@@ ders .
The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995 .
Fre@@ em@@ an worked for several years to get Mand@@ ela &apos;s story onto the big screen .
My only aim was to play this role as realis@@ tically as possible , said Fre@@ em@@ an .
Naturally , the greatest challenge was to speak like Mand@@ ela .
The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park , he would try to meet Mand@@ ela , go for dinner with him , and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches .
The most important thing was that he wanted to sha@@ ke Mand@@ ela &apos;s hand .
I found out that when I take your hand , I draw on your energy , it flows into me , and I feel that I know how you are feeling , he said .
For me it &apos;s important to try and become a different person .
In the film , Mat@@ t Dam@@ on portra@@ ys Franç@@ ois Pi@@ en@@ aar , the cap@@ tain of the national rug@@ by team , which was dominated by white players .
The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of rug@@ by to prepare for the role .
It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pi@@ en@@ aar at his home .
I remember ring@@ ing his door@@ bel@@ l , he opened it , and the very first thing I said to Franç@@ ois Pi@@ en@@ aar was : &apos; I look much bigger on the screen . &apos;
Despite the evident differences in the stat@@ ure of the actors compared to their real-@@ life counter@@ parts , under E@@ ast@@ wood &apos;s direction , In@@ vic@@ tus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an O@@ scar nom@@ ination .
The Da@@ ily Vari@@ ety film cri@@ tic To@@ d@@ d McCar@@ thy summ@@ ed up the film by saying : &quot; It was a great story , a very well-@@ made film . &quot;
In the film reviews on ro@@ tt@@ ent@@ om@@ ato@@ es@@ .com , In@@ vic@@ tus has a 76 percent positive rating .
Sec@@ ret of the gl@@ are over Norway solved : the Russians were testing a ro@@ cket
St@@ range lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway .
Yesterday the Russian defence mini@@ stry finally admitted that it had tested an inter@@ continental bal@@ li@@ stic missi@@ le not far from the Norweg@@ ian border .
However , it was another un@@ successful launch and the missi@@ le , which is known as &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; and should have been the pride and gl@@ ory of the Russian army , has gradually turned into a night@@ mare for the Russian gener@@ als and Prime Minister , V@@ ladimir Putin .
His repeated presence at tests on the ro@@ cket has not affected the success rate of the test flights .
The Bul@@ ava has generally not li@@ fted off or has been damaged in the air .
The Russian newspapers are descri@@ bing the &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; as &quot; the fli@@ ght@@ less ro@@ cket . &quot;
The ro@@ cket that doesn &apos;t fly but lights up
This , the 13th test , started off according to plan .
But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missi@@ le .
Appar@@ ently the engine ble@@ w up in the ro@@ cket &apos;s third phase .
This time , the &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; was launched from the atom@@ ic sub@@ marine D@@ mit@@ ri@@ j Don@@ ski@@ j , which was cru@@ ising under the surface of the White Sea .
This type of ro@@ cket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even sub@@ mer@@ ged .
This makes it likely that the mysteri@@ ous light over Norway , caused by an uni@@ denti@@ fied flying object , was actually the mal@@ functioning &quot; Bul@@ ava . &quot;
Any@@ way , the Norweg@@ i@@ ans never had any doubts that it was a Russian ro@@ cket .
The gener@@ als are defending themselves this time though , claiming that it can &apos;t be described as a total failure .
The first two phases of the ro@@ cket went well , and the accident happened during the third stage .
Pre@@ viously , the engines have always mal@@ func@@ tioned during the first phase .
Even though not one test launch has been completely err@@ or-@@ free , the defence mini@@ stry consider only six out of the thir@@ teen tests to have been failures .
The gener@@ als are optimistic about this almost fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ percent success rate and keep insi@@ sting that the &quot; Bul@@ ava &quot; will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hy@@ person@@ ic nuclear blocks weigh@@ ing a total of 1.@@ 15 tons .
The legendary Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v signs a year &apos;s contract with CS@@ K@@ A Moscow aged 51
The legendary def@@ ender V@@ ja@@ č@@ es@@ la@@ v Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v will again play a professional ic@@ e-@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey match at the age of 51 .
The former world champion , Olympic winner and Stan@@ ley Cup holder will help out his team , CS@@ K@@ A Moscow , when they need him , and will evi@@ dently be playing in the fifth K@@ H@@ L du@@ el against Saint Petersburg .
Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v , who reti@@ red at for@@ ty in 1998 , is currently the president of CS@@ K@@ A .
Since Den@@ is K@@ ul@@ ja@@ š was injured , we urgently need another def@@ ender .
Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v is training regularly and has agreed to help the team .
We just need to sort out a few form@@ alities , the AP agency quoted the Moscow club coach Ser@@ ge@@ j N@@ ě@@ m@@ č@@ in@@ ov as saying .
It &apos;s not year clear whether or not the famous ho@@ ck@@ ey player &apos;s com@@ eb@@ ack will be for just one match .
I think Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v is someone who can boost the mor@@ ale of the other players , said N@@ ě@@ m@@ č@@ in@@ ov .
According to AP , if Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v returns to the ice , he will be the oldest Russian professional ho@@ ck@@ ey player .
In the N@@ H@@ L , the legendary attack@@ er Gor@@ die Ho@@ we played for Hart@@ ford for a whole season at the age of fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ one and sc@@ ored 15 goals and 26 assi@@ sts .
The oldest of the famous qu@@ int@@ et of Fe@@ ti@@ so@@ v , Kas@@ at@@ on@@ ov , Mak@@ aro@@ v , L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov , and Kr@@ ut@@ ov is one of the best and most successful ho@@ ck@@ ey players of all time .
In the Soviet Union uniform , he received two Olympic gold med@@ als , seven world champ@@ ionship tiles , and tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship .
In the second half of his career , he also enjoyed success in the N@@ H@@ L , when wearing the Det@@ ro@@ it uniform , he twice raised the Stan@@ ley Cup over his head .
Since 2001 , he has been a member of the Ho@@ ck@@ ey Hall of F@@ ame .
Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i obli@@ ges unions . All over@@ time is cut
The management of the Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i car plant in No@@ š@@ o@@ vice has agreed with the unions to cut all over@@ time .
It is because of all this forced over@@ time that the unions have declared a strike on Monday .
This was confirmed by the Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i spo@@ kes@@ man , Pet@@ r Van@@ ě@@ k .
The management , however , wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year .
We can &apos;t give up on our production plan , it &apos;s essential , so we have proposed voluntary over@@ time on Saturday December 19th , involving two shi@@ fts , said Van@@ ě@@ k .
The website S@@ ed@@ mi@@ č@@ ka@@ .@@ cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 C@@ Z@@ K .
This bonus will also be paid retro@@ sp@@ ectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28@@ th .
According to Van@@ ě@@ k , the firm has decided to change how it motiv@@ ates its employees to take the proposed over@@ time .
Ei@@ ther they &apos;ll claim the additional wage for the over@@ time or they can take time off in li@@ eu on December 28@@ th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day , said Van@@ ě@@ k .
Additionally , all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for .
Consi@@ dering that over@@ time was the most pressing and thor@@ ny question for the unions , as well as for the prot@@ esting employees who brought production to such a gr@@ in@@ ding halt last week , the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all over@@ time for December , said Van@@ ě@@ k .
Until last week , virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours &apos; over@@ time on top of their normal eigh@@ t-@@ hour shi@@ fts .
After signing the agreement , the trade unions will call off the strike
Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning .
On Wednesday , the head of the unions , Pet@@ r Ku@@ cha@@ ř , said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document , they are willing to call off the strike .
The situation at the plant deterior@@ ated sharp@@ ly last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spont@@ aneous strike to protest against the inc@@ ess@@ ant over@@ time .
They were also prot@@ esting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution .
The management responded by saying that employees had to work over@@ time to meet the demand for cars .
In Monday &apos;s announcement of the strike , the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who hal@@ ted production last Wednesday .
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep over@@ time to a minimum .
Moreover , this year they are requesting that a 5000 cro@@ wn bonus be paid for this work .
The Hy@@ un@@ da@@ i car plant in No@@ š@@ o@@ vice now emplo@@ ys 2000 people .
The firm began series production last November .
By this September , it had made around 80@@ ,000 cars , and its current capacity is 200@@ ,000 vehicles a year .
Czech discovery : a substance which works on &apos; tough &apos; forms of the HIV virus
A team of Czech and German scientists has been testing a new compo@@ und which can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body .
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medic@@ ation .
In some cases , this out@@ weigh@@ s the fact that the compo@@ und used for the normal form of the virus does not have such a strong effect as some drugs that are already available .
No cure has yet been found for AIDS .
Pati@@ ents &apos; lives can be greatly pro@@ long@@ ed by a mixture of drugs which prevent the HIV virus from multi@@ pl@@ ying in the body .
However , they have a number of si@@ de-@@ effects .
Moreover , if the propag@@ ation of the virus is not completely sup@@ pressed , it can lead to the development of resistant viruses , against which drugs are no longer effective .
The work being done by experts from three institutions , the Czech Academy of Sciences , V@@ Š@@ CH@@ T Prague , and the University of Heidelberg , is opening up the way to deal with the r@@ the virus &apos; resistance .
They have shown that substances known as met@@ all@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus .
Metall@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es are a compo@@ und of bor@@ on , hydro@@ gen , carbon , and co@@ b@@ alt .
These compo@@ unds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today , and so they may get over the resistance problem .
In their work , the scientists are coming up with new ‘ improved ’ compo@@ unds , prepared using knowledge of the molec@@ ular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein .
Metall@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es have a unique three-@@ dimensional structure : two multi-@@ w@@ alled c@@ ages consisting of bor@@ on , hydro@@ gen and carbon at@@ oms are connected to a metal atom , in this case co@@ b@@ alt .
A tre@@ ach@@ erous and har@@ dy virus
The HIV prot@@ ease is the protein of the HIV virus , which is essential to the life-@@ cycle of the virus .
The mature inf@@ ec@@ tious vir@@ al cor@@ pus@@ cles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by the HIV prot@@ ease .
If we can stop the HIV prot@@ ease , we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient &apos;s body , the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organ@@ ic Chem@@ istry and Bio@@ chem@@ istry of the Czech Academy of Sciences .
In a paper published in the Journal of Medi@@ cinal Chem@@ istry , the scientists describe a series of compo@@ unds in which there are two p@@ airs of c@@ ages ( see the di@@ ag@@ ram ) connected by a short organic chain , which is then systematically modified .
Some@@ what weaker , but more reliable
The effectiveness of this series of substances against the HIV prot@@ ease has been tested in a test@@ -@@ tube , as well as its effectiveness against the more immune ( resistant ) stra@@ in as acquired from patients infected with the HIV virus .
The effect of met@@ all@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es on the normal stra@@ in of the enz@@ y@@ me is not as strong as that of drugs used in clinical practice , although their effect is not dimin@@ ished against the resistant stra@@ ins , whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective .
The unique mechanism of the effect and also of its other properties , such as its biological and chemical stability , low tox@@ ic@@ ity , and the possibility of making other chemical modifications , make met@@ all@@ ac@@ ar@@ bor@@ an@@ es an interesting compo@@ und for future research aimed at suggest@@ ing new effective drugs to combat HIV , says P@@ av@@ l@@ í@@ na Ř@@ ez@@ á@@ č@@ ov@@ á , head of the Structural Bi@@ ology laboratory at the Institute of Organ@@ ic Chem@@ istry and Bio@@ chem@@ istry and the Institute of Mol@@ ec@@ ular Gen@@ e@@ tics of the Academy of Sciences .
F@@ all-@@ out over the budget . O@@ DS attacks Fischer , who def@@ ends himself
The head of the O@@ DS , Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k , described the next year &apos;s approved budget as &quot; terrible &quot; and said that Premier Jan Fischer &apos;s government should seriously re@@ think its position in office .
The government chairman described the O@@ DS statement as strong words .
Appar@@ ently he will take some time to think about it .
The vic@@ e-@@ chairman of the O@@ DS , Pet@@ r Ne@@ č@@ as , said that the concept of an interim government supported by the Č@@ SS@@ D , O@@ DS , and Green Party , was evi@@ dently no longer working .
According to Ne@@ č@@ as , the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit , or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left .
The approaches taken by the O@@ DS and social democ@@ rats on the issue of public deficits are diam@@ etri@@ cally opposed , re@@ marked Ne@@ č@@ as .
On Wednesday , the House accepted the budget for 2010 , naturally with the left &apos;s proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crow@@ ns .
The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees , for social services , and for direct payments to farmers .
he government criticised the social democ@@ rats &apos; proposals , saying that they will sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously increase the budget deficit .
The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 16@@ 3 billion crow@@ ns .
Before the vote , the O@@ DS left the room , compl@@ ying with the government &apos;s wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the pro@@ visi@@ onal budget .
Dis@@ appointment and fu@@ tili@@ ty
The finance minister , E@@ du@@ ard Jan@@ ota , has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and fu@@ tili@@ ty , while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation .
Ne@@ č@@ as is convinced that if Jan@@ ota were to really threaten to res@@ ign should the proposed amendments be accepted , the situation would look completely different .
According to Czech Tel@@ evision , Jan@@ ota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session .
At the same time , he indicated that he was re@@ thinking his position in office .
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks .
If Fischer comm@@ its himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit , Ne@@ č@@ as believes that the Č@@ SS@@ D appoint@@ ees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government .
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resign@@ ation if the House appro@@ ves other laws that will increase the deficit , those relating to sick pay , pensions , or the amendment to the Civil Ser@@ v@@ ants Act for example .
Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k : Ministers appointed to the O@@ DS have committed no off@@ ence
This is a matter for the minist@@ erial chairman Fischer and the government as a whole .
Ministers appointed to the O@@ DS have done nothing wrong , stressed Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k in a text report from the USA .
He pointed out that several minist@@ ries employ people in under-@@ secret@@ ary positions who support TO@@ P 09 , which voted against the budget .
Ne@@ č@@ as emphasised that , if Fischer were to decide to res@@ ign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit , &quot; it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House . &quot;
But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democ@@ rats .
I haven &apos;t thought about it , and I &apos;ll concentrate on that when the time comes , defence minister Martin Bar@@ t@@ á@@ k told re@@ por@@ ters in the House , having been elected by the civil democ@@ rats .
This afternoon , Prime Minister Fischer fle@@ w to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting .
O@@ DS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister
Ne@@ č@@ as also stressed that , on Wednesday in the House , the O@@ DS would evi@@ dently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democ@@ rats to allow the budget to be approved .
We don &apos;t look like orph@@ ans , we &apos;re not little children , was how he re@@ acted to the question of whether the O@@ DS was not ham@@ pered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget .
I didn &apos;t notice that my vote was missing .
Back when I ren@@ ounced my mandate , I knew that the following months would see the Bol@@ sh@@ ev@@ isation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive , Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k himself responded .
The new Czech Rail@@ ways timetable shows that fewer trains will be running for almost the same far@@ es
From December 13th , Czech Rail@@ ways will be canc@@ elling or restric@@ ting some less frequ@@ ented express and local trains , but will be adding more services to other lines .
As of the day the new timetable comes into force , there will be two percent fewer services in comparison with now .
Most far@@ es , including basic and special tickets , will stay the same .
More links to the capital will be available , for example , to the people in the O@@ stra@@ va region , as the railways are adding one P@@ end@@ ol@@ ino to that line .
However , the express will stop running to B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va .
There will be fewer express trains on the Prague - P@@ í@@ se@@ k - Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice route , and the direct service from Prague - Let@@ oh@@ rad will be cut dramatically .
The region planning the greatest transport cuts is the Region of H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ á@@ lov@@ é , with a total cut of eight percent , although Prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a rise .
Two night trains on the Prague - T@@ á@@ bor - Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice line are also being cut , and several express services on the Prague - P@@ í@@ se@@ k - Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice route will be reduced to just a few days a week .
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of the new direct line from Milo@@ vice to Prague , since people now travelling from Milo@@ vice have to change in L@@ ys@@ á n@@ ad Lab@@ em .
This is the fif@@ teenth line in the E@@ sko sub@@ urban system , which can now be opened since the track from L@@ ys@@ á n@@ ad Lab@@ em to Milo@@ vice has been fully electri@@ fied .
Long@@ -@@ distance services to the capital will end at the Prague H@@ lav@@ n@@ í n@@ á@@ dra@@ ž@@ í station .
Czech Rail@@ ways is introducing more P@@ end@@ ol@@ ino routes between Prague and O@@ stra@@ va and trains to Š@@ um@@ per@@ k / Jes@@ en@@ í@@ k will run on two-@@ hour inter@@ vals .
From December 13th , passengers will no longer be able to take P@@ end@@ ol@@ ino to B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va .
This year &apos;s cost of regional railways : 200 million more
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport , and next year it will give the railways four billion crow@@ ns to cover demonstr@@ able losses , the same amount as this year . Local trains are ordered by the regional authorities , who , next year , will pay out a total of eight billion crow@@ ns for them , while almost three billion will be contributed by the state .
This year , regional trains are co@@ sting 200 million more .
Czech Rail@@ ways have concluded a new ten-@@ year contract for local and express trains , whereas , previously , the contract was always for one year .
The railways have pra@@ ised the system , despite the fact that the great majority of far@@ es have not been increased .
The only changes are to Č@@ D Net one-@@ day network tickets and e@@ Li@@ š@@ ka cheap internet tickets .
Trav@@ ellers without a customer card will find that the Č@@ D Net price has increased from 450 crow@@ ns to 600 crow@@ ns .
The e@@ Li@@ š@@ ka price will now depend on the distance trav@@ elled , whereas , previously , it was a flat rate of 160 crow@@ ns to travel between any regional cities .
Fili@@ p@@ ino g@@ un@@ men still holding more than 50 people , Children have been released
Today , g@@ un@@ men in the south of the Philipp@@ ines kid@@ n@@ apped 75 people , including several primary school students and their teachers .
This from the AF@@ P agency , which originally announced only 65 ab@@ duc@@ te@@ es .
All 17 of the captured children , together with their teacher , were released after eight hours .
The kid@@ n@@ apping happened in the province of Ag@@ us@@ an del S@@ ur .
Around 19 g@@ un@@ men are apparently using the host@@ ages as a human shi@@ eld in their escape from the police .
Local negoti@@ ators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining host@@ ages .
According to AF@@ P , the g@@ un@@ men are part of the New People &apos;s Army ( N@@ PA ) , which is the armed fac@@ tion of the Communist Party of the Philipp@@ ines ( CP@@ P ) .
According to AP , the police had originally been ch@@ asing the kid@@ n@@ app@@ ers following violence that occurred as accounts were settled between two local family c@@ lan@@ s .
In the province of Mag@@ u@@ in@@ dan@@ ao , in the south of the Philipp@@ ines , mar@@ ti@@ al law has been declared due to the recent mass@@ ac@@ re which left 57 people dead .
The victims of the mass@@ ac@@ re on November 23@@ rd , which was related to the elections for govern@@ or , included 30 re@@ por@@ ters .
The govern@@ or of this southern Fili@@ p@@ ino province has been arrested on sus@@ pic@@ ion of involvement in the mass@@ ac@@ re , together with his father And@@ al Amp@@ at@@ uan , the patri@@ arch of the influential Amp@@ at@@ uan family .
Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts are also active on Min@@ dan@@ ao .
But on Tuesday , these separ@@ ati@@ sts renewed peace talks with the Fili@@ p@@ ino government .
The story of South Africa affects everyone , says Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an ali@@ as Mand@@ ela
In the next few days , the new Hollywood film In@@ vic@@ tus by Clin@@ t E@@ ast@@ wood will hit American cin@@ em@@ as , depic@@ ting part of the life of the former South African president N@@ elson Mand@@ ela .
The role of the world-@@ famous oppon@@ ent of apar@@ thei@@ d is taken on by Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an , who was apparently chosen years ago by Mand@@ ela himself for his talent .
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rug@@ by champion Fran@@ co@@ is Pi@@ en@@ aar is played by Mat@@ t Dam@@ on .
With the film in cin@@ em@@ as critics and the public
N@@ elson Mand@@ ela
N@@ elson Ro@@ li@@ h@@ l@@ ah@@ la Mand@@ ela was born on July 18th , 19@@ 18 in M@@ vez , in South Africa .
In 1988 he was awarded the Sak@@ har@@ ov Prize for Freedom of Th@@ ought , and in 1993 received the Nobel Peace Prize with de K@@ ler@@ k .
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 .
There were great expectations , as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa busy preparing for the football world champ@@ ionship , but the media was also ri@@ fe with worrying news about increasing ra@@ cial hat@@ red and discrimination by the black majority .
According to the AP news agency , the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in South Africa , despite the number of objections to &quot; br@@ at-@@ pack &quot; Hollywood stars being cast in the main roles .
However , despite what he says , Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an is proud of the new film .
I had dre@@ amt about this role for many years and prepared for it well .
I met N@@ elson Mand@@ ela many times to , as they say , draw on his energy , he said in an interview after the film &apos;s grand premi@@ ere in Los Angeles .
I think it &apos;s good that we can commem@@ or@@ ate Mand@@ ela and his mission in a film .
It is a story about South Africa , but it affects everybody , he added .
In the national rug@@ by team uniform
The film , based on the book by the British writer John Car@@ lin , entitled Pla@@ ying the En@@ em@@ y : N@@ elson Mand@@ ela and the Game that Made a Nation , portra@@ ys the South African human rights activ@@ ist during his first presidential election campaign .
In the film , Morgan Fre@@ em@@ an tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so long been seg@@ reg@@ ated and , like N@@ elson Mand@@ ela did in 1995 , appears in the film in the South African national rug@@ by uniform at the world cup match , which was won by South Africa .
For appearing in the kit , which is an almost sac@@ red symbol in South Africa , four@@ teen years ago , Mand@@ ela received a standing ov@@ ation from the predomin@@ antly white spec@@ t@@ ators and gained the est@@ e@@ em of the white people .
Perhaps a football champ@@ ionship can actually bring people together as one nation , said rug@@ by player Ch@@ ester Willi@@ ams , who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team .
Whether the ten@@ se situation in South Africa will improve is only now becoming apparent .
White South Afri@@ cans , however , are scep@@ tical , as rug@@ by fan Christop@@ her Da@@ w@@ son , who fl@@ ed the country to go to Britain , admitted in a recent interview for L@@ N .
The champ@@ ionship begins on June 11th , 2010 .
Trans@@ former worth tens of millions of crow@@ ns bur@@ ns in Loun@@ y region
In the morning , a fire broke out in a trans@@ former owned by Č@@ eps at the switching station in the village of V@@ ý@@ š@@ ko@@ v , near Loun@@ y .
Six fire engines came out to fight the fire , said the spo@@ kes@@ man for the Ú@@ st@@ í regional fire@@ figh@@ ters , Lu@@ k@@ á@@ š Mar@@ van .
Origin@@ ally , the fire@@ figh@@ ters wanted to let the trans@@ former burn , but later changed their minds and are putting the fire out using a mix of water , fo@@ am , and special fi@@ re-@@ sup@@ pression agents .
The fire was caused by a technical fault , a short circuit inside the trans@@ former .
Nob@@ ody was h@@ urt , and according to company spo@@ kes@@ person P@@ av@@ la Mand@@ á@@ to@@ v@@ á , the incident will not hin@@ der the safe operation of the distribution station .
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crow@@ ns , although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
Mand@@ á@@ to@@ v@@ á says that the ru@@ ined trans@@ former will have to be replaced with a new one .
She added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that Č@@ eps has been operating , and this kind of fault was a one-@@ off .
According to Č@@ E@@ Z spo@@ kes@@ woman for northern Boh@@ em@@ ia , Son@@ ia Hol@@ inger@@ ov@@ á H@@ end@@ ry@@ cho@@ v@@ á , there were no power cuts and households , offices and companies were not affected by the trans@@ former fire .
In the Czech Republic , the joint stock company Č@@ eps is the exclusive operator of transmission systems and 400 k@@ V and 220 k@@ V power lines .
It maintains , restor@@ es and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transform@@ ers conver@@ ting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system , as well as 4@@ 3@@ 39 kilometres of power lines .
Jan@@ č@@ ura files a s@@ lander suit against three Č@@ SS@@ D commission@@ ers
The owner of Stu@@ dent Agency , Radi@@ m Jan@@ č@@ ura , will today file a s@@ lander suit against three social democ@@ rat commission@@ ers .
These are Mich@@ al Ha@@ š@@ ek , commission@@ er for South Mor@@ avi@@ a , Rad@@ ko Mart@@ í@@ ne@@ k , commission@@ er for Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce , and Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c commission@@ er Martin T@@ es@@ a@@ ř@@ í@@ k .
Jan@@ č@@ ura announced this in the Tw@@ enty Minutes programme on Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l .
The suit relates to the company &apos;s attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions .
However , all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Rail@@ ways .
So now all three commission@@ ers are att@@ acking us and saying that we &apos;re getting the best out of it , while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted .
They claim that we &apos;re more expensive than Czech Rail@@ ways , which is not true , as we know the Czech Rail@@ ways prices that were concluded last week .
So all we can do is defend ourselves .
It &apos;s for s@@ lander against Stu@@ dent Agency , Jan@@ č@@ ura told Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l .
He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law .
He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission .
Ha@@ š@@ ek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jan@@ č@@ ura &apos;s great media show , which works as a free adverti@@ sement for himself and his company .
It &apos;s understandable that I &apos;m prepared to defend my good name and that of my region , and I call upon the other commission@@ ers to do the same .
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jan@@ č@@ ura who is manipul@@ ating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments , said Ha@@ š@@ ek .
Last week , Jan@@ č@@ ura said that he is investing several million crow@@ ns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities .
He told Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l that he was hal@@ ting the campaign for Christmas and would rest@@ art it in the New Year .
He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such .
Jan@@ č@@ ura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Rail@@ ways and had not announced ten@@ ders for the order , worth around 150 billion crow@@ ns .
According to Jan@@ č@@ ura this is illegal and in contra@@ vention of the principles of the European Court of Justice .
Jan@@ č@@ ura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the Č@@ SS@@ D .
The only threat was that if we don &apos;t stop this , we could lose our bus licence .
He introduced himself as a member of the Č@@ SS@@ D , I know who it was but I &apos;m not going to say his name , Jan@@ č@@ ura told Radio@@ ž@@ ur@@ n@@ á@@ l today .
V@@ acc@@ inations against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us will be free and voluntary .
Starting January , vacc@@ inations against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us will radic@@ ally change ing@@ ra@@ ined hab@@ its .
These should be the first free yet voluntary vacc@@ inations for families .
But some are saying that compulsory vacc@@ inations would be more effective .
Pre@@ par@@ ations for the introduction of free anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations are reaching a peak .
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vacc@@ ines to be paid for by health insurance companies .
Exper@@ ts are now clear on how to proceed with the vacc@@ inations .
New vacc@@ inations
V@@ acc@@ ines free of charge for children born in August
Starting January , there could be free anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations for children born on or after August 2nd .
The condition is that they have not received any prior vacc@@ inations .
Anyone who began to be vacc@@ inated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-@@ vacc@@ inations .
The first bat@@ ch of vacc@@ inations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old .
Last year , one in four families had their children volunt@@ arily vacc@@ inated against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us .
Par@@ ents paid 16@@ 00 crow@@ ns or more per vacc@@ ination .
The yo@@ ung@@ est children require four vacc@@ inations .
Overall , experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crow@@ ns a year on vacc@@ inations .
But they save on the treatment that un@@ vacc@@ inated children would otherwise need .
So far , the state has been paying around 500 thousand crow@@ ns a year on all general vacc@@ inations for children .
Subsi@@ dis@@ ed vacc@@ inations were introduced as part of the Jan@@ ota package .
P@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us causes inf@@ ections of the middle ear , but also serious inf@@ ections of the cer@@ eb@@ ral mem@@ bran@@ es and blood po@@ is@@ oning .
P@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ al inf@@ ections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year , according to hospital figures .
Besides the Czech Republic , around 40 countries have introduced general anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations for children .
Will vacc@@ inations be compulsory ?
Some believe that in the future these vacc@@ inations could be compulsory .
As of January , they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory .
The head of the N@@ ahl@@ as civil association , Ru@@ dol@@ f K@@ alo@@ v@@ sk@@ ý , says that compulsory vacc@@ inations would be better .
His association has long been promoting p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ ines .
The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vacc@@ inations .
It &apos;s not completely ideal .
On the other hand , we &apos;re happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vacc@@ inations in place .
I think this is the route we have to take , said K@@ alo@@ v@@ sk@@ ý .
The Ministry of Health , however , does not want to change the p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ ination system .
We &apos;re not considering it at this time , said mini@@ stry spo@@ kes@@ man V@@ las@@ tim@@ il S@@ r@@ š@@ e@@ ň .
Vol@@ unt@@ ary vacc@@ inations have their draw@@ backs , say doctors
The chair@@ woman of the Professional Society of Pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians , H@@ ana Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á , acknowled@@ ges that voluntary vacc@@ inations have their draw@@ backs .
If all children were vacc@@ inated , the number of re@@ vacc@@ inations could then be cut . &quot; With vacc@@ ines co@@ sting so much , we can understand the political decision that vacc@@ inations should be offered on a voluntary basis , &quot; says Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á .
Exper@@ ts assume that , starting next year , more than 80 percent of new parents will have their bab@@ ies vacc@@ inated against p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us .
The anti-@@ p@@ neu@@ mo@@ co@@ cc@@ us vacc@@ inations are a mil@@ estone in that they are the first general vacc@@ inations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies , not the state .
In@@ surance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment , explains Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á .
Doc@@ tors will have to buy vacc@@ ines themselves
However , practi@@ sing pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians are concerned when it comes to buying the vacc@@ ines .
According to the original plan , the vacc@@ ines would be purchased by the insurance companies , and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vacc@@ inations .
Some ministers , however , are worried that the insurance companies could &quot; run wild with health insurance funds &quot; .
So doctors will have to buy the vacc@@ ines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money .
It is estimated that practi@@ sing pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vacc@@ ines , which is a lot of money .
It certainly won &apos;t be easy , says Cab@@ r@@ no@@ cho@@ v@@ á .
US artist &apos;s son &apos; in museum th@@ ef@@ t@@ &apos;
The son of renowned American fantas@@ y artist Frank Fra@@ z@@ etta , has been charged with trying to ste@@ al paintings worth $ 20@@ m ( £ 12@@ m ) from his father &apos;s museum .
Police in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania say Al@@ fon@@ so Frank Fra@@ z@@ etta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and tra@@ iler .
They say Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta and another man used an excav@@ ator to break into the museum in the Po@@ con@@ o Mountains region .
Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta Sn@@ r , aged 81 , is fam@@ ed for his depic@@ tion of characters such as Con@@ an the Bar@@ b@@ arian and Tar@@ z@@ an .
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident , the Associ@@ ated Press news agency reported .
AP quoted an un@@ named police official as saying the younger Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta may have been motivated by a family feu@@ d .
A police aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it said Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta J@@ n@@ r , 52 , claimed he had been instruc@@ ted by his father to &quot; enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a storage facility &quot; , the agency reported .
Mr Fra@@ z@@ etta Sn@@ r denied granting any such permission , the agency said .
Labour def@@ ends budget tax rises
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre-@@ Budget report against criticism from the opposition , business and unions .
The T@@ ories said Ali@@ sta@@ ir Dar@@ ling &quot; ble@@ w &quot; an opportunity to show he was serious about cutting the deficit by del@@ aying decisions until after the election .
The chan@@ cell@@ or also came under fire for h@@ itting low and middle income workers .
Among his head@@ line proposals are a 0.5 % rise in National In@@ surance and a 1 % cap on public pay settlements from 2011 .
National In@@ surance anger
Uni@@ ons have prot@@ ested that low-@@ paid workers are being pen@@ alised for a recession not of their making and warned of &quot; problems &quot; ahead .
The National In@@ surance increase - which will raise about £ 3@@ b@@ n a year - has anger@@ ed the business community , which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery .
The increase , limited to those earning more than £ 20@@ ,000 a year , will hit about 10 million workers .
KE@@ Y PO@@ IN@@ TS OF P@@ B@@ R
National In@@ surance up by a further 0.5 % from April 2011
Economy to shr@@ ink by worse than expected 4.@@ 75 % this year
New 50 % tax on ban@@ ker bon@@ uses
1@@ p rise in cor@@ poration tax for small firms scra@@ pped
Ta@@ x reb@@ ates for electric cars and wind tur@@ bin@@ es
State pension to rise by 2.5 %
According to Treas@@ ury estimates , someone earning £ 30@@ ,000 will be £ 90 a year worse off and someone on £ 40@@ ,000 will be £ 190 worse off , while someone earning £ 10,000 a year will be £ 110 better off .
Ministers said their target of hal@@ ving the deficit by 2013 meant &quot; difficult decisions &quot; but insi@@ sted that 60 % of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5 % of ear@@ ners .
Treas@@ ury minister Stephen Tim@@ ms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a &quot; drop in the ocean &quot; compared to what was needed .
&quot; These are large numbers . They will deliver for us this hal@@ ving of the deficit which is absolutely essential over the next four years , &quot; he told the BBC .
Mr Tim@@ ms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the turn of the year .
However , Labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to bor@@ row and how quickly he deficit is cut - have been ques@@ tioned after the chan@@ cell@@ or was forced to re@@ vise earlier figures .
In his statement , he said the economy was likely to contract 4.@@ 75 % this year - far worse than the 3.5 % decline predic@@ ted in April - while bor@@ rowing would be £ 3@@ b@@ n higher than earlier estimated .
&apos;@@ B@@ lown opport@@ un@@ ity@@ &apos;
The Conserv@@ atives , who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour &apos;s &quot; debt crisis &quot; , said proj@@ ected bor@@ rowing of £ 7@@ 8@@ 9@@ b@@ n over the next six years was un@@ sustainable .
M@@ ni@@ sters had failed to lay out a credible plan for how they would pay this back , they added , &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cally &quot; du@@ cking tough choices until after the election - which must be held by June 2010 .
&quot; They have not included anything of significance they are going to do , &quot; said shadow Treas@@ ury minister Phili@@ p H@@ amm@@ ond . &quot; They had an opportunity to do it and they have b@@ lown it . &quot;
&quot; The all important announc@@ ements will come after the election , wh@@ o@@ ever wins it &quot;
Rog@@ er Boot@@ le , Del@@ o@@ itte
Labour insist that schools , hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts unlike under T@@ ory proposals which would see the deficit cut faster and further .
But the Li@@ b D@@ ems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit , argu@@ ing the plans were &quot; built on sand &quot; .
The BBC &apos;s political editor N@@ ick Rob@@ inson said some of the timing of the announc@@ ements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chan@@ cell@@ or open to accus@@ ations of elec@@ tion@@ e@@ ering as the money may simply be cla@@ w@@ ed back the year after .
However , Labour insist the extra help is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010 .
&apos;@@ Ph@@ on@@ ey bud@@ get@@ &apos;
Although ministers did not publish spending details for beyond 2011 , economists said it was clear the squ@@ ee@@ ze on public spending would only begin to b@@ ite in the medium term .
The respected Institute for Fis@@ cal Studies said the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s figures imp@@ lied substantial cuts in many areas , potentially including transport , higher education , science and defence , in the future .
&quot; It really is holding off the pain until later , &quot; said its director Robert Cho@@ te .
&quot; The all important announc@@ ements will come after the election , wh@@ o@@ ever wins it , &quot; added Rog@@ er Boot@@ le , economic advis@@ er to accoun@@ t@@ ants Del@@ o@@ itte .
&quot; This has been the ph@@ on@@ ey pre-@@ Budget report . The markets realise this . &quot;
F@@ B@@ I prob@@ es &apos; US Pakistan arres@@ ts@@ &apos;
The F@@ B@@ I is investig@@ ating the arrest in Pakistan of five reported US men on sus@@ pic@@ ion of extrem@@ ist links .
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sar@@ gh@@ o@@ da in eastern Pun@@ j@@ ab province , Pakistan &apos;s US emb@@ ass@@ y told the BBC .
The F@@ B@@ I has said it is investig@@ ating whether they are the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the US state of Vir@@ g@@ inia last month .
The US State Department said it was also seeking information on the men .
Three of them are reported to be of Pakist@@ ani des@@ cent , one of Egyptian heritage and the other of a Y@@ emen@@ i background .
&quot; If they are American citizens , we of course are going to be very interested in the charges that they &apos;ve been det@@ ained on and in what sort of circumstances they &apos;re being held , &quot; said spo@@ kes@@ man I@@ an Kel@@ ly .
F@@ B@@ I spo@@ kes@@ woman Ka@@ ther@@ ine Sch@@ weit said the agency was aware of the arres@@ ts and was in contact with the families of the missing students .
&quot; We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identi@@ ties and the nature of their business there , if indeed these are the students who had gone missing , &quot; she said .
The Pakist@@ ani emb@@ ass@@ y in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an unc@@ le of one of them .
He said the house was already of interest to local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men .
Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton dec@@ lined to comment on the arres@@ ts , reported the R@@ eu@@ ters news agency , but said the US had to &quot; work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recru@@ it and train people &quot; .
The five students were reported missing from their homes in northern Vir@@ g@@ inia by their families in late November .
Am@@ nesty condem@@ ns Iranian &apos; ab@@ us@@ es@@ &apos;
Human rights in Iran are as poor as at any time over the past 20 years , according to a report from campaign group Am@@ nesty International .
The report details &quot; patterns of abuse &quot; by the regime before and after disp@@ uted presidential elections in June .
One man quoted in the report said he had been be@@ aten and bur@@ ned with cigar@@ ettes . Another said he was threatened with rap@@ e .
Iran has dis@@ missed previous criticism of its human rights record .
Offici@@ als have said such criticism is politically motivated .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of people were arrested and doz@@ ens killed in Iran after the disp@@ uted election of President Mah@@ m@@ oud Ah@@ ma@@ d@@ ine@@ j@@ ad led to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Do@@ z@@ ens have been given j@@ ail terms , and prosec@@ ut@@ ors say at least five people have been sent@@ enced to death .
BBC T@@ ehr@@ an correspon@@ dent , J@@ on Le@@ y@@ ne , who is now in London , says that early in the protests , the su@@ preme leader , Ay@@ at@@ ollah Ali K@@ ham@@ en@@ ei , accepted some of the alleg@@ ations of abuse , ordering the closure of the K@@ ah@@ ri@@ z@@ ak detention centre .
But since then , there has been almost no tolerance of criticism by the authorities , our correspon@@ dent says .
&apos;@@ Fal@@ se con@@ fession@@ &apos;
Am@@ nesty International c@@ ited the account of 26@@ -@@ year-old comp@@ uting student E@@ bra@@ him M@@ eh@@ tar@@ i , who said he was accused of &quot; working with Facebook networks &quot; and prot@@ esting against the election result .
&quot; They frequently beat me on the face , &quot; he was quoted as saying .
&quot; I was bur@@ ned with cigar@@ ettes under my eyes , on the neck , head ... They threatened to execute me and they hum@@ ili@@ ated me . &quot;
After five days he signed a false con@@ fes@@ sion and was taken out and left in the street , still ble@@ eding and semi-@@ conscious , Am@@ nesty said .
In August , defe@@ ated presidential candidate M@@ eh@@ di Kar@@ rou@@ bi said some protes@@ ters det@@ ained after the election had been tor@@ tured to death in prison and others had been rap@@ ed .
Iranian officials denied the rap@@ e claims , but admitted that abuses had taken place .
Am@@ nesty also c@@ ited the case of a former det@@ ain@@ ee who said he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre at K@@ ah@@ ri@@ z@@ ak .
Am@@ nesty accepted that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-@@ election un@@ rest and the government &apos;s response , but it said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the parliamentary committee &apos;s findings had not been made public .
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to forest@@ all further demonstrations .
Ski slope is created in city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol land@@ mark into a p@@ iste for a competition .
The P@@ iste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-@@ professional ski@@ ers and snow borders competing for cash prizes .
At the top of the slope in Brand@@ on Hill park there was a short jump r@@ amp before a 100@@ m-@@ long slope .
Four@@ th-@@ year medical student John H@@ ick@@ man said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope but it was pretty da@@ unting .
It &apos;s a beautiful view with all the city lights below all tw@@ in@@ kl@@ ing .
There &apos;s some of the best ski@@ ers and snow borders in the county here - some real talent , &quot; he added .
Pri@@ zes were awarded for the best tri@@ cks - or manoeu@@ v@@ res performed on the slope .
After Thursday evening &apos;s event the snow will be left to m@@ elt away .

Can Islam Be French ?
Pl@@ ur@@ alism and Pra@@ gm@@ atis@@ m in a Sec@@ ular@@ ist State .
AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of min@@ ar@@ ets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islam@@ isation of Europe , John Bow@@ en , an American academic , has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate — and are integrating — into one of the continent ’ s most av@@ ow@@ edly secular societies .
Some readers will come to this new book as admir@@ ers of the author ’ s last work , &quot; Why the French Don ’ t Like Head@@ scar@@ ves &quot; ( 2006 ) , an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and pre@@ occupied the country for a decade and a half , and whose effects are still felt today .
Mr Bow@@ en ’ s latest book has a broader and more ambitious can@@ vas .
As a good an@@ throp@@ ologist , he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France , but what is actually happening on the ground .
He has spent months in the mos@@ ques , schools and institutes which now provide France ’ s 5@@ m-@@ 6@@ m Muslims with what Mr Bow@@ en calls &quot; Islamic spaces &quot; .
He is a good listen@@ er , re@@ producing debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most .
Should a Muslim get married in a mos@@ que or a town hall ( or both ) ?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and g@@ ay rights ?
Can a Muslim woman mar@@ ry a non-@@ Muslim man ?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest@@ -based banking system to get a mort@@ gage ?
It is these seem@@ ingly m@@ und@@ ane issues , he argu@@ es , that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dram@@ as that pre@@ occup@@ y the media .
The author identi@@ fies a new generation of im@@ ams , teachers and intellec@@ tu@@ als , none of them household names , with the possible exception of Tari@@ q Ram@@ ad@@ an , a Swis@@ s-@@ born Arab Muslim schol@@ ar and academic .
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society .
They are not having the argument all their way .
Conserv@@ atives are susp@@ icious of the very idea of a French or European Islam .
The thin@@ kers and activists whom Mr Bow@@ en interviews tend to be at odds with their Sal@@ af@@ i counter@@ parts — advocates of the pur@@ ist Sun@@ ni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia — who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe ’ s Muslims .
Mr Bow@@ en thinks that Muslim values and French sec@@ ular@@ ism could be compatible .
But accommodation requires gi@@ ve-@@ and-@@ take on both sides .
He questions how far French policymakers ( and the intellectual elite that so f@@ ier@@ c@@ ely gu@@ ards la@@ ï@@ cit@@ é ) are really committed to plur@@ alism .
He suggests that Muslims are probably getting a ra@@ wer deal than the Catho@@ lic@@ s , Protest@@ ants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular re@@ public@@ anism .
Rather than a growing pragm@@ atis@@ m , he det@@ ects a &quot; tigh@@ tening of the valu@@ e-@@ scre@@ ws &quot; .
Can Islam be French ? After reading this book , one is inc@@ lined to say , &quot; Yes , but not yet . &quot;
The ble@@ ak@@ est outlook in the world
THE Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environment on the planet .
The ice that defines it is mel@@ ting with alarming speed , taking with it life that can survive no@@ where else .
Oil , gas , shipping and fishing interests have been heading into the newly open water , with diplom@@ ats , lawyers , and now authors , in their wake .
In &quot; On Th@@ in I@@ ce &quot; Richard El@@ lis , a writer and illustr@@ ator , pain@@ ts a natural history of the icon of the north , the pol@@ ar bear .
Well@@ -@@ vers@@ ed in the complicated history and politics of wh@@ aling , he describes the long tradition of Arctic expl@@ or@@ ers who proved themselves by taking on the white bear .
Admir@@ al N@@ elson ’ s encounter as a plu@@ cky 14-@@ year-old mid@@ ship@@ man fighting only with the but@@ t of his mus@@ ket is surely a my@@ th , but others are true .
Young bears , captured as they sw@@ am after the bodies of their newly killed mothers , were caught and sent to z@@ oos and cir@@ c@@ uses .
One early 20@@ th-@@ century big@@ -@@ top act featured 75 pol@@ ar bears at once .
Even today , zo@@ o en@@ clos@@ ures are still typically a milli@@ on@@ th of the area of a wild adult ’ s range . The climate is rarely suitable : the resident pol@@ ar bear in Singapore has turned green from al@@ ga@@ e growing within the hol@@ low ha@@ irs of its coat .

Mr El@@ lis draws on the accounts of other writers and hist@@ ori@@ ans , and often returns to the threat that h@@ unter@@ s pose to the survival of the species .
Although banned in Norway , America and Russia , the killing continues in Gre@@ enland and Canada , where h@@ unter@@ s in helicop@@ ters and sk@@ id@@ oo-@@ riding In@@ u@@ it Indi@@ ans both use high-@@ powered ass@@ ault rif@@ les to bring down their quar@@ ry .
Iron@@ ically it is in the waters towards the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longest .
In his new book , &quot; After the I@@ ce &quot; , A@@ lu@@ n Ander@@ son , a former editor of New Scienti@@ st , offers a clear and ch@@ illing account of the science of the Arctic and a gri@@ pping gli@@ mp@@ se of how the future may turn out there .
Not that scientists have all the answers .
Neither atmosp@@ her@@ ic scientists nor oc@@ e@@ an@@ ograph@@ ers can adequately account for the speed of the changes .

Satelli@@ te surve@@ ys and large ar@@ rays of ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g-@@ mounted prob@@ es are a useful addition , but much is still done by har@@ dy individuals camp@@ ed out in the cold .
Mr Ander@@ son looks in on the extraordinary , tiny world of the tri@@ but@@ ary system within the Arctic ice , formed by tri@@ ck@@ les of br@@ iny water which gets squ@@ ee@@ zed as it free@@ zes .

U.S. government contrac@@ tor arrested by Cuban officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contrac@@ tor who was distribut@@ ing cell@@ phones and laptop computers in the country , State Department officials said Saturday .
The contrac@@ tor , who has not yet been identified , works for Development Altern@@ atives Inc . , based in Be@@ thes@@ da .
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank .
Cons@@ ular officers with the U.S. Inter@@ est Section in Hav@@ ana are seeking access to the det@@ ain@@ ee , who was arrested Dec@@ . 5 .
The specific charges have not been made public , though under Cuban law , a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of &quot; danger@@ ousness . &quot;
All so-called counter-@@ revolutionary activities , which include mild protests and critical writ@@ ings , carry the risk of arrest .
Anti-@@ government gra@@ ff@@ iti and speech are considered serious crimes .
Cuba has a fle@@ dging blo@@ gging community , led by the popular comm@@ ent@@ ator Yo@@ ani S@@ án@@ che@@ z , who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and har@@ ass@@ ed by government agents .
S@@ án@@ che@@ z has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards but has been denied permission .
The detention of an American contrac@@ tor may likely raise tensions between the Castro brothers Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration , which has been pursuing a &quot; go@@ -@@ slow &quot; approach to improving relations with the island .
News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times Friday night .
The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps , such as fre@@ eing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition , the United States will reciproc@@ ate .
C@@ ell@@ phones and lap@@ tops are legal in Cuba , though they are new and co@@ v@@ eted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $ 15 a month .
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cell@@ phones just this year ; they are used mostly for tex@@ ting , as a 15-@@ minute telephone conversation would eat up a day &apos;s wages .
Internet use is extremely limited on the island .
It is available in expensive hotels and to foreign visitors there , and at some government out@@ lets , such as universities .
Cub@@ ans who want to log on often have to give their names to the government .
Access to many Web sites is restricted .
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare .
Most of the hand@@ ful of U.S. citizens in j@@ ail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smu@@ ggling , said Gl@@ oria Ber@@ ben@@ a , the press officer at the U.S. Inter@@ ests Section in Hav@@ ana .
Ber@@ ben@@ a said she could not provide more information on the arrest .
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong .
An activity that in any other open society would be legal -- giving away free cell@@ phones -- is in Cuba a crime , said J@@ ose Miguel Vi@@ v@@ anc@@ o , director of the Americ@@ as program of the group Human Rights Watch , which recently issued a tough report on freedoms in Cuba called &quot; New Castro , S@@ ame Cuba , &quot; a reference to the installation of Rau@@ l Castro as the leader of the country to replace his ailing older brother Fi@@ del .
Vi@@ v@@ anc@@ o said that the accused are often arrested , tried and impris@@ oned in a day .
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often prov@@ ok@@ es a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries begin to move toward more dialogue .
Pakist@@ ani officials un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakist@@ ani authorities on Saturday zer@@ o@@ ed in on the alleged master@@ mind of a plot to send five Northern Vir@@ g@@ inia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops , saying they hope the case could help un@@ ra@@ vel an extensive network of terrorist recru@@ it@@ ers who s@@ co@@ ur the Internet for radic@@ alized young men .
Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ators said they were hunting for a shad@@ ow@@ y ins@@ urgent figure known as Sa@@ i@@ ful@@ l@@ ah , who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments appro@@ ving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube .
Sa@@ i@@ ful@@ l@@ ah guided the men once they were in Pakistan , attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan &apos;s tri@@ bal belt that is home to al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda and its terrorist training camps .
But a Pakist@@ ani intelligence official who had been brief@@ ed on the case said Saturday that Sa@@ i@@ ful@@ l@@ ah was un@@ successful in convincing al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda comm@@ anders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate the terrorist network .
As a result , they were mar@@ o@@ oned for days in the eastern city of Sar@@ go@@ d@@ ha , far from the forbi@@ d@@ ding mountains of the nor@@ thwest that have become a terrorist haven .
They were regarded as a sting operation .
That &apos;s why they were rejected , said the official , who spoke on the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity because of the sensitivity of the case .
The official said the men were und@@ eter@@ red and were still trying to acquire the right endor@@ sements to gain access to the al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda camps when they were arrested by Pakist@@ ani law enforcement .
The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being ques@@ tioned by the F@@ B@@ I -- under@@ scores the critical role of recru@@ it@@ ers in identifying potential terrorists and , perhaps more importantly , determining who can be tru@@ sted .
Since the S@@ ept . 11 , 2001 , attacks , U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda .
The organization &apos;s recru@@ it@@ ers act as g@@ at@@ eke@@ ep@@ ers , keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to hol@@ y war , and those who could be sp@@ ies .
W@@ oul@@ d-@@ be American recru@@ its are treated by al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda with special scrutiny , an@@ alyst@@ s said .
But they are also considered enorm@@ ously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value .
But E@@ van Koh@@ l@@ mann , senior analy@@ st with the U.@@ S.@@ -based NE@@ F@@ A Foundation , said terror groups have also become much more cau@@ tious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recru@@ iting methods .
If you &apos;re trying to s@@ ink someone into these groups , what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed ? Koh@@ l@@ mann said .
The model is one that has become far more Web@@ -based .
T@@ ens of thousands protest in Copenhagen , demand climate &apos; ac@@ tion@@ &apos;
T@@ ens of thousands of protes@@ ters mar@@ ched on the streets here Saturday , demanding b@@ older action on climate from the negoti@@ ators working inside the city &apos;s B@@ ella Convention Center .
Prot@@ es@@ ters said as many 100@@ ,000 people joined in the event , but police estimated the count was closer to 25@@ ,000 .
The event was relatively peaceful , though a hand@@ ful of m@@ asked activists set off small explo@@ si@@ ves near a group of government buildings downtown .
On a day when little happened in the U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ sponsor@@ ed climate talks , thousands of activists wal@@ ked across the city holding bann@@ ers in English saying &quot; There is No Planet B &quot; and one in Spanish declar@@ ing , &quot; The Earth is S@@ aying , &apos; En@@ ough . &apos;
Several celeb@@ ri@@ ties joined the protest , including Danish model and photographer Hel@@ ena Chri@@ sten@@ sen , who said that traveling to her mother &apos;s native country of Peru made me aware of the hear@@ t@@ breaking issues the country is dealing with due to the imp@@ acts of climate changes that are already occurring . &quot;
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big mar@@ ch -- to pass on the word and to appeal to the world &apos;s leaders to deliver a fair , ambitious and binding deal , she said .
It is not an easy task , but it needs to be done , there is no way around it anymore .
The police kept the protes@@ ters from getting too close to the B@@ ella center , and said they had arrested 19 people , primarily on the grounds that they had either worn mas@@ ks or carried po@@ cket kni@@ ves .
Those activities are banned during demonstrations under Danish law .
According to one b@@ yst@@ ander , who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks , activists sporting mas@@ ks and black out@@ fits set off several explo@@ si@@ ves near Copenhagen &apos;s main can@@ al , which is nearby several minist@@ ries .
They were lob@@ bing them by the buildings , he said , adding they began as f@@ lar@@ es but were followed by &quot; a couple big explo@@ sions . &quot;
In@@ side the convention center , people gathered around television screens to watch the mar@@ ch throughout the afternoon .
But the protest did not seem to pen@@ et@@ rate the consciousness of key officials such as Su W@@ ei , China &apos;s chief climate negoti@@ ator .
When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on the international deliber@@ ations , he rep@@ lied in English , &quot; Ac@@ tually , that is something that I was not aware of . &quot;
He then continued in Mand@@ arin , saying , &quot; Because the venue is large , I cannot hear what is happening outside . &quot;
He observed that whether the mar@@ ch was hur@@ ting or helping dep@@ ended on one &apos;s perspective .
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change , he said .
On the other hand , &quot; You can also say that they dis@@ rupt the negotiations , or the freedom of other people .
Test data reveal st@@ ub@@ born ra@@ cial gaps
Last week &apos;s federal report card on math achievement was a welcome piece of good news for D.@@ C. public schools .
Although the District still lags far behind the country &apos;s top-@@ performing systems , the report card showed four@@ th@@ - and eigh@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders making stri@@ des at a faster pace over the past two years than cities including Atlan@@ ta , Chicago and New York .
But what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the National Ass@@ ess@@ ment of Educ@@ ational Pro@@ gress is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white students both locally and nation@@ ally .
The average scores of white D.@@ C. four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders over the past two years grew from 26@@ 2 to 2@@ 70 ( on a scale of 500 ) , but their African American pe@@ ers &apos; rose just three points , from 20@@ 9 to 2@@ 12 .
The achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009 , from 53 to 58 points .
African American progress in the eigh@@ th grade remained essentially flat , di@@ pping a statis@@ tically in@@ significant one point , from 2@@ 45 to 24@@ 4 .
A@@ verage white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size wasn &apos;t large enough .
The picture across a six-@@ year stretch isn &apos;t more encouraging .
The gap separ@@ ating white and black four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders in 2003 , when the first NA@@ EP in the District was given , was 60 scale points ( 26@@ 2 to 20@@ 2 ) .
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period , the difference has barely nar@@ row@@ ed to 58 .
Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Mich@@ elle A. R@@ he@@ e and Mayor Adri@@ an M. F@@ enty ( D ) were prop@@ elled largely by white students who are already high ach@@ ie@@ vers .
It would suggest that we &apos;ve raised the aggreg@@ ate by treating those at the higher end of the scale , which is problematic and troub@@ les@@ ome , said J@@ ef@@ f Smith , executive director of D.@@ C. Vo@@ ice , a non@@ profit group that advocates for educational equality in the District .
I &apos;m not j@@ umping up and down about a tw@@ o@@ - or three-@@ point spread , said D.@@ C. Council member K@@ w@@ ame R. Brown ( D-@@ At Large ) , who has a daughter in the fourth grade at E@@ aton Elem@@ entary .
A frequent cri@@ tic of R@@ he@@ e &apos;s management style , Brown said the message of the test scores is that the city &apos;s middle schools are in desper@@ ate need of attention .
Clearly , you always want to see the plus signs , and I respect that .
But what &apos;s sc@@ ary is we &apos;re not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools .
R@@ he@@ e said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-@@ achieving students .
This fall , for example , some teachers are being trained to use a new reading cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the Wil@@ son Re@@ ading System , targeted to students in the upper el@@ ementary and middle school grades who didn &apos;t master the basi@@ cs of reading early in their school care@@ ers and are significantly behind their pe@@ ers .
Every@@ day Ma@@ themati@@ cs , a K-@@ throu@@ gh@@ -@@ six@@ th-@@ grade math cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um empha@@ si@@ zing games and real-@@ life experiences that was brought to the District under former super@@ int@@ endent Cli@@ f@@ ford Jan@@ ey , is credited with some of the NA@@ EP progress reported last week .
I just think we have to keep working at bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level , R@@ he@@ e said .
Others say that the NA@@ EP &apos;s results highlight the question of whether R@@ he@@ e can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-@@ performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap .
There is a sort of rou@@ gh@@ -@@ ed@@ ged di@@ lem@@ ma here for Mich@@ elle R@@ he@@ e , said Bru@@ ce Ful@@ ler , an education professor at the University of California at Ber@@ kel@@ ey who studies urban test scores .
The conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest sections of D.@@ C.
So the target@@ ing may yield political repercussions that go against that important agenda .
But the ru@@ b , of course , is like other urban super@@ int@@ end@@ ents , she &apos;s trying to hold on to the white and black middle class .
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools .
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families , regardless of where they live , are confident that their children can get an excellent public education .
Jan@@ ey , now super@@ int@@ endent of schools in Ne@@ war@@ k , said in an interview this week that one essential element to closing the achievement gap is to leng@@ then the traditional public school year , currently 180 days in the District , to compete with charter schools .
You have to get up near 200 days to have the force of change , said Jan@@ ey , who came to agreement with his teachers &apos; union last year on a 18@@ 5-@@ day year , which he regards as &quot; a mark@@ er &quot; for seeking a bigger increase in the next contract .
Making higher education a part of more fut@@ ures
The tour bus pul@@ led into G@@ ett@@ ys@@ burg College with a loud whe@@ e@@ ze .
Gra@@ ci@@ ela Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , 12 , step@@ ped off and b@@ linked for a moment at the white columns , bri@@ ck fac@@ ades and emer@@ ald law@@ ns .
Gra@@ ci@@ ela &apos;s parents had barely gradu@@ ated from high school in El Salvador .
Until recently , Gra@@ ci@@ ela herself , who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Ri@@ verd@@ ale , had never set foot on a college camp@@ us .
Yet as she and the other eigh@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders in the group expl@@ ored G@@ ett@@ ys@@ burg , where the tu@@ ition runs $ 3@@ 8,@@ 6@@ 90 a year , their attitude was less that of a@@ west@@ ru@@ ck visitors than of enthusiastic prosp@@ ective students .
Yes ! This is where I &apos;ll be ! exc@@ laimed Gra@@ ci@@ ela , who would like to study medicine , when the guide announced that they &apos;d entered the science building .
W@@ ow , really ? she said thou@@ ght@@ fully , when told of the school &apos;s low prof@@ ess@@ or-@@ to-@@ student ratio .
The P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania college was the s@@ eventh the kids had visited on their three-@@ day tour , and by now they had completely absor@@ bed its intended message : The question is not whether you &apos;re going to college .
The question is where .
Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.@@ S.@@ -@@ born children of His@@ pan@@ ic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregn@@ ant as teen@@ agers , there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educ@@ ations they need to enter the middle class .
In fact , one in five of these &quot; second-@@ generation &quot; His@@ pan@@ ics gradu@@ ates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their im@@ migrant parents , mostly Mex@@ ic@@ ans and Central Americans , entered the United States without finishing high school .
Their success stories are important , researchers say , because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an out@@ size role in the country &apos;s workforce .
Those who study high ach@@ ie@@ vers say they often have a natural aff@@ inity for school and an inn@@ ate drive to succeed .
Many also have parents who set lo@@ f@@ ty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their un@@ famili@@ arity with American schools .
But ment@@ oring programs also can play an enormous role in helping Gra@@ ci@@ ela and millions of children like her make it to college -- particularly if those efforts are sustained over time .
When you &apos;re looking at low-@@ income kids whose parents don &apos;t have the experience and the skills to help them navig@@ ate through the system , any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it , said Patri@@ cia G@@ án@@ dar@@ a , a resear@@ cher at the University of California , Dav@@ is , who has studied Lat@@ ino students .
We need to think about providing a suppor@@ tive network for these kids from pres@@ ch@@ ool all the way on through high school .
The federal program that funded Gra@@ ci@@ ela &apos;s college tour is a useful example .
Know@@ n as G@@ E@@ AR UP , it provides more than $ 300 million a year to local school systems to run college pre@@ p programs that begin when low-@@ income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school .
Since 1999 , the program has served more than 10 million students , with more than 60 percent going on to college , according to the U.S. Department of Education .
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability , the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to re@@ build its ailing infrastructure during two auc@@ tions that concluded Saturday .
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China , Russia and European oil firms are po@@ ised to play a major role in refur@@ bish@@ ing Iraq &apos;s oil industry , cri@@ p@@ pled by decades of war and sanctions .
American companies wal@@ ked away with st@@ akes in just two of the 10 auc@@ tioned fields .
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction , which began Friday .
The only one that submitted a bid lost .
Two American companies reached deals for fields auc@@ tioned in June .
The me@@ ager representation of American oil gi@@ ants in Iraq &apos;s opening oil industry surprised an@@ alyst@@ s .
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war , and instead of U.S. companies , you have Asi@@ ans and Europeans leading the way , said Rub@@ a Hus@@ ari , the editor of Iraq Oil Forum , an online news out@@ let .
It will be a long time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq .
Conc@@ ern@@ s over security , under@@ sc@@ ored by massive coordinated bom@@ b@@ ings Tuesday , and political instability as the U.S. military with@@ draws , likely kept American oil companies from vent@@ uring more for@@ c@@ efully in Iraq , which has the world &apos;s third-@@ largest proven cru@@ de reserves , an@@ alyst@@ s said .
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because ri@@ vals , particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms , have mark@@ edly lower labor costs and are more pr@@ one to take risks because they don &apos;t respond to shareholders .
Ex@@ x@@ on-@@ Mo@@ bil and Oc@@ ci@@ dental Pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the mini@@ stry .
Major U.S. firms such as Ch@@ ev@@ ron and Con@@ o@@ co@@ Phil@@ li@@ ps , which have cultiv@@ ated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years , wal@@ ked away emp@@ ty-@@ handed .
Russian companies Lu@@ ko@@ il and Gaz@@ pro@@ m were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend .
Stat@@ e-@@ owned Chinese National Pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um Cor@@ p@@ . bid on more contracts than any other company and wal@@ ked away with large st@@ akes in contracts for two major fields .
We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power , Oil Ministry spo@@ kes@@ man Ass@@ am Ji@@ had said .
We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq .
Companies pre-@@ selected to submit bi@@ ds made offers that were then compared to the per bar@@ rel fee the mini@@ stry was willing to pay for boo@@ sting output above current levels at each field .
Top al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda plann@@ er apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missi@@ le strike along Pakistan &apos;s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda operations plann@@ er this week , U.S. counter@@ terrorism officials said Friday .
If confirmed , this would be the second de@@ adly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall .
Sal@@ eh al@@ -S@@ om@@ ali was one of two Arab men thought to have been killed when a pair of missi@@ les t@@ ore into their car Tuesday near the town of Mir@@ an Sha@@ h in North W@@ azi@@ rist@@ an province , according to U.S. sources and Pakist@@ ani officials in the region .
Local authorities said the missi@@ les were fi@@ red by an un@@ mann@@ ed aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan &apos;s law@@ less tri@@ bal belt .
They were driving in a white car , heading toward the Afghan border , when the car was hit , said an official with Pakistan &apos;s civilian intelligence agency , speaking by phone from Mir@@ an Sha@@ h .
The official said susp@@ ected local milit@@ ants rus@@ hed to the spot and quickly conf@@ isc@@ ated what remained of the &quot; totally demo@@ lished bodies . &quot;
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims &apos; identi@@ ties , but two U.S. counter@@ terrorism officials c@@ ited un@@ specified evidence that Som@@ ali was among the dead .
Som@@ ali was described as a senior al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda military plann@@ er who ran the terrorist group &apos;s operations outside the Afghan@@ ist@@ an-@@ Pakistan region .
He was engaged in pl@@ ot@@ ting throughout the world , said one senior official , who spoke on the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity , c@@ iting the sensitive nature of U.S. air@@ strikes inside Pakist@@ ani territory .
Given his central role , this probably included pl@@ ot@@ ting attacks against the United States and Europe .
He took strategic guidance from al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda &apos;s top leadership and translated it into operational blu@@ ep@@ rin@@ ts for prosp@@ ective terrorist attacks .
The second U.S. official said Som@@ ali had risen quickly through al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda &apos;s ranks and was well-@@ connected with other extrem@@ ist groups in the region .
He may not be a household name to some Americans , but that in no way dimin@@ ishes the threat he posed to us and our allies , the second official said .
If his death is confirmed , Som@@ ali would be the second senior al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda or Taliban leader killed since September , when a similar strike killed Na@@ j@@ mu@@ d@@ din J@@ al@@ olo@@ v , the leader of a milit@@ ant fac@@ tion in the tri@@ bal belt , and three other top oper@@ atives .
The temp@@ o of strikes by CI@@ A-@@ run d@@ ron@@ es has dec@@ lined since the summer , from an average of about six operations per month to two , according to a t@@ ally by the Long War Journal , a Web site managed by a non@@ profit group .
The decline may be due to improved tac@@ tics by terrorist groups , which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ru@@ th@@ lessly killing susp@@ ected inform@@ ants , the site said .
Top U.@@ N@@ . en@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul to step down
The United Nations &apos; top en@@ vo@@ y in Afghanistan , K@@ ai Ei@@ de , said Friday that he would step down from his post in March , ending a tum@@ ul@@ tu@@ ous ten@@ ure that was mar@@ red by alleg@@ ations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan &apos;s U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ backed presidential election .
Ei@@ de &apos;s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30@@ ,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
The U.@@ N@@ . en@@ vo@@ y said that he supports the sur@@ ge but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a military draw@@ down beginning in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces .
We need to accelerate the buil@@ du@@ p of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afgh@@ ans that they can trust the international community , Ei@@ de said in a telephone interview from Kab@@ ul .
The commitment has to be long-term .
The Norweg@@ ian diplom@@ at also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants ai@@ ding Afghanistan &apos;s political transition .
The sur@@ ge on the military side has to be copied on the civilian side , he said .
Ei@@ de said he was not resign@@ ing but simply fulfilling a commitment he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kab@@ ul .
He said he wanted to serve notice to U.@@ N@@ .
Secretary General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon now so that he would have time to find a replacement .
What I &apos;ve said is that you better start looking for a successor , Ei@@ de said .
When I came here , there was a two-@@ month vacuum between a departure of my predecessor and my arrival .
B@@ an has begun searching for a replacement , according to U.@@ N@@ . officials .
The officials say he has been considering St@@ aff@@ an di M@@ ist@@ ura , a Swe@@ dish@@ -@@ Italian national who recently headed the U.@@ N@@ . mission in Ba@@ gh@@ dad , and Jean-@@ Marie Gu@@ é@@ hen@@ no , a Fren@@ ch@@ man who previously led U.@@ N@@ . peac@@ eke@@ eping operations .
Ei@@ de &apos;s standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former dep@@ uty , Peter W. Gal@@ bra@@ i@@ th , accused him in September of favor@@ ing President Ham@@ id Kar@@ z@@ ai in the country &apos;s presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud .
Ei@@ de denied the alleg@@ ations , but he said the accus@@ ations by Gal@@ bra@@ i@@ th -- who was fi@@ red -- &quot; certainly damaged the mission , because there was already a great degree of skep@@ ticism with regard to international interference &quot; in the election .
Ei@@ de said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.@@ S.@@ -@@ led forces in Afghanistan .
He also urged the U.@@ N@@ . leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that don@@ ate to the Afghan mission , saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly spent .
Ei@@ de expressed fru@@ stration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan , saying that cum@@ ber@@ some U.@@ N@@ . hi@@ ring regulations under@@ cut his ability to bring in talent .
The U.@@ N@@ . rules are such that I have only been able to recru@@ it a single person since May , he said .
That is catastro@@ phi@@ c and can &apos;t continue .
Gates : Iran to face additional sanctions
Def@@ ense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose &quot; significant additional sanctions &quot; on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions .
Gates , speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week@@ -@@ long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic re@@ public .
There are no good options in Iran , he said , in response to a query from a soldi@@ er about the lik@@ el@@ ihood of such a development . ¨
One of the things that weigh@@ s on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years , &#91; it &#93; is the inherent un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability of war .
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran &apos;s military and political elite , but Gates sign@@ aled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iran@@ i@@ ans .
He said that &quot; a package of incentives and dis@@ incentives &quot; would be needed &quot; to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons &quot; because &quot; their people will suffer enorm@@ ously &quot; from sanctions .
In a statement Friday by White House spo@@ kes@@ man Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs , the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &quot; credible &quot; consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.@@ N@@ . Security Council and its nuclear wat@@ ch@@ dog , the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency .
Iran insi@@ sts that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes .
In talks in Geneva on Oc@@ t@@ . 1 , it indicated that it would return to talks on res@@ training its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial portion of its stock@@ pi@@ le of enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium in exchange for desper@@ ately needed fuel for a medical research re@@ actor .
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations .
But since then , Iran appears to have wal@@ ked away from the t@@ entative deals -- in part , experts say , because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States .
Frank@@ ly , Iran &apos;s sti@@ ff@@ ing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October , I think , has brought the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iran@@ i@@ ans , Gates said .
President Obama has set a Dec@@ . 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he turns to re@@ viewing other options , including pursuing what Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Ro@@ d@@ ham Clinton once called &quot; cri@@ p@@ pling sanctions . &quot;
In a statement issued in New York , Iran &apos;s mission to the United Nations den@@ ounced what it called &quot; bas@@ eless and un@@ founded alleg@@ ations &quot; Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran &apos;s nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers &quot; in order to achieve an appropriate , long-term solution . &quot;
Gates , who was to return to Washington late Friday , met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki before flying to Iraq &apos;s o@@ il-@@ rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kir@@ ku@@ k and Kurdish officials in Ir@@ bil .
Ten@@ sions remain high between the Kur@@ ds and Iraq &apos;s Arab majority , particularly over boundaries , property rights and re@@ ven@@ u@@ e-@@ sharing .
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in U.S. plans to cut the number of American troops from 1@@ 15@@ ,000 to 50@@ ,000 by the end of August .
Gates also sought to all@@ ay Kurdish anx@@ i@@ ety about the pending draw@@ down . U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Mass@@ oud Bar@@ z@@ ani , president of the Kur@@ dist@@ an Regional Government : &quot; We will preserve your security , prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq .
We will not abandon you . &quot;
In aging China , a change of course
W@@ ang Wei@@ j@@ ia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda post@@ ers lec@@ turing them that &quot; M@@ other Earth is too tired to sustain more children &quot; and &quot; One more baby means one more tom@@ b . &quot;
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials , al@@ armed by their city &apos;s low birth@@ rate and aging population , ab@@ rup@@ tly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child , their reaction was instant and firm : No way .
We have already given all our time and energy for just one child .
We have none left for a second , said W@@ ang , 31 , a human resources administrator with an 8-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old son .
More than 30 years after China &apos;s one-@@ child policy was introduced , creating two generations of not@@ ori@@ ously ch@@ ub@@ by , spo@@ iled only children aff@@ ection@@ ately nick@@ named &quot; little em@@ per@@ ors , &quot; a population crisis is lo@@ oming in the country .
The average birth@@ rate has pl@@ um@@ met@@ ed to 1.@@ 8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect , according to the U.@@ N@@ .
Pop@@ ulation Division , while the number of residents 60 and older is predic@@ ted to explo@@ de from 16.@@ 7 percent of the population in 2020 to 3@@ 1.1 percent by 2050 . That is far above the global average of about 20 percent .
The im@@ balance is worse in weal@@ thy coastal cities with highly educated populations , such as Shanghai .
Last year , people 60 and older accoun@@ ted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai &apos;s registered residents , while the birth@@ rate was less than one child per couple .
X@@ ie L@@ ing@@ li , director of the Shanghai Mun@@ icip@@ al Pop@@ ulation and Family Pl@@ anning Commission , has said that fer@@ tile couples need to have bab@@ ies to &quot; help reduce the proportion of the aging population and allevi@@ ate a workforce shortage in the future . &quot;
Shanghai is about to be &quot; as old -- not as rich , though -- as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden , &quot; she said .
A gradual easing
Written into the country &apos;s constitution in 1978 , China &apos;s one-@@ child policy is argu@@ ably the most controversial mandate introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date .
Cou@@ ples who viol@@ ate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual sal@@ ary in some areas -- and discrimination at work .
Chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical stra@@ in on its natural resources , while human rights advocates have den@@ ounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy .
In rural areas , some officials have forced women pregn@@ ant with a second child to under@@ go abor@@ tions .
In addition , many couples have had sex@@ -@@ sel@@ ective abor@@ tions , leading to an un@@ naturally high mal@@ e-@@ to-@@ female ratio .
In recent years , population officials have gradually sof@@ tened their stance on the one-@@ child policy .
In 2004 , they allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007 , they t@@ oned down many of their hard-@@ line slo@@ gan@@ s .
Q@@ i@@ ao Xi@@ a@@ och@@ un , a professor at the Institute of Pop@@ ulation Research at Peking University , said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes , such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child .
In July , Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more bir@@ ths .
Almost overnight , post@@ ers direc@@ ting families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detail@@ ing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit .
The city government dispat@@ ched family planning officials and volunte@@ ers to meet with couples in their homes and sli@@ p le@@ af@@ lets under doors .
It has also ple@@ dged to provide emotional and financial coun@@ sel@@ ing to those elec@@ ting to have more than one child .
The response has been under@@ whel@@ ming , family planning officials say .
Dis@@ appointing response
Although officials in one rural town on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Shanghai say they saw an up@@ tick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched , the more urban districts report no change .
Hu@@ in@@ an t@@ own@@ ship , with a population of 1@@ 15@@ ,000 , for instance , is still receiving just four to five applications a month .
Dis@@ appointed Shanghai officials say that , despite the campaign , the number of bir@@ ths in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 16@@ 5,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008 .
F@@ eng Ju@@ ying , head of the family planning committee in Shanghai &apos;s Ca@@ ol@@ u t@@ own@@ ship , said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don &apos;t want more children .
They want to give the best to their first , she said .
Y@@ ang Ji@@ a@@ wei , 27 , and his wife , Li@@ u Ju@@ an@@ ju@@ an , 26 , said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so .
But like many Chinese , they have only the sc@@ ant medical and life insurance provided by the government .
Without a social safety net , they say , the choice would be irresponsible .
People in the West wron@@ g@@ ly see the one-@@ child policy as a rights issue , said Y@@ ang , a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregn@@ ant with the couple &apos;s first child .
Yes , we are being rob@@ bed of the chance to have more than one child .
But the problem is not just some policy .
It is money .
Other couples c@@ ite psychological reasons for hes@@ it@@ ating .
W@@ ang , the human resources administrator , said she wants an only child because she was one herself : &quot; We were at the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us .
We are not used to taking care of and don &apos;t really want to take care of others . &quot;
Ch@@ en Zi@@ j@@ ian , a 4@@ 2-@@ year-old who owns a translation company , put it more bl@@ un@@ tly .
For the du@@ al-@@ career , mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class parents who are bringing the birth@@ rate down , he said , it &apos;s about being successful enough to be sel@@ fish .
Today &apos;s 20@@ - and 30-@@ some@@ things grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China &apos;s experiment with capitalism and don &apos;t want that kind of life for themselves , he said .
Even one child makes huge demands on parents &apos; time , he said .
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life .
Then there are the space issues -- &quot; You have to re@@ model your apartment &quot; -- and the strateg@@ izing -- &quot; You have to have a ré@@ sum@@ é ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best pres@@ cho@@ ols . &quot;
Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once , Ch@@ en said , but not twice .
O@@ urs is the first generation with higher living standards , he said .
We do not want to make too many sacrific@@ es .
U.@@ N@@ . group dra@@ fts plan to reduce emissions
The U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ sponsor@@ ed climate conference -- characterized so far by un@@ ru@@ ly post@@ uring and mutual rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document out@@ lining ambitious gre@@ enh@@ ou@@ se-@@ gas reductions over the next 40 years , with industri@@ alized nations shoul@@ dering most of the burden in the near term .
The text , which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases , highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illumin@@ ated a path forward .
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time , with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week .
For@@ ged by a U.@@ N@@ . ad-@@ hoc working group , the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term .
And it provides a range of options for the key questions , including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output , and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to toler@@ ate .
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process , said John Co@@ equ@@ y@@ t , senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club .
Michael Z@@ am@@ mit C@@ ut@@ aj@@ ar , who drafted the six-@@ page document , bo@@ iled down a 18@@ 0-@@ page negotiation text to focus on what the U.@@ N@@ . &apos; s top climate official , Y@@ vo de Bo@@ er , described as &quot; the big picture . &quot;
It shows the out@@ lines for a possible deal , in which industrial nations would coll@@ ectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels , while major developing countries would reduce thei@@ rs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent .
Together , the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050 .
The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by ple@@ dging to provide $ 3.@@ 6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from cop@@ ing with flood and d@@ rought to avoiding de@@ forest@@ ation .
Still , Friday featured the same sort of verb@@ al fire@@ works that have dominated the talks for the past week .
U.S. special climate en@@ vo@@ y To@@ d@@ d Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of gre@@ enh@@ ou@@ se-@@ gas emissions for industri@@ alized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world .
The move sign@@ aled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago .
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries step@@ ping up and taking action , said Stern , who also compl@@ ained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers .
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Y@@ af@@ ei said America &apos;s top climate negoti@@ ator was either lacking &quot; common sense &quot; or being &quot; extremely irresponsible &quot; for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming .
With the future economic tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory of the world &apos;s major powers at stake , fault lines have erup@@ ted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies .
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet , with China and the United States feu@@ ding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world &apos;s two do@@ zen most influential countries are ign@@ oring the scientific imperative to take b@@ older action .
Ric@@ ardo U@@ late , a Costa Ric@@ an deleg@@ ate , said it &apos;s not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for cur@@ bing greenhouse gases , even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big em@@ it@@ ters accountable for their actions .
This is clearly a game where a new economic he@@ gem@@ ony is being developed , said U@@ late , who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change advis@@ er for Conserv@@ ation International .
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen , although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best .
The Alliance of Small Island States , which has 43 members , produced a 24-@@ page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning .
Art@@ ur Run@@ ge-@@ M@@ etz@@ ger , who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission , said the push by small island nations has &quot; put political pressure on the entire political process , &quot; in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India .
The talks took on new urgency as deleg@@ ates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal .
High-@@ level officials such as Indian environment minister J@@ ai@@ ram Ram@@ esh and the Chinese vice minister step@@ ped off planes and ra@@ ced through the B@@ ella Center &apos;s halls to clos@@ ed-@@ door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitr@@ ated over the next week .
The she@@ er spra@@ w@@ l of the gathering -- where 13@@ ,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , gu@@ itar@@ -@@ playing activists put on ni@@ gh@@ tly shows mo@@ cking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand@@ -to-@@ hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .
The intensity is only building : nearly all of the key ministers are now here , and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen .
We &apos;re getting into the big leag@@ ues , said Carlos Manuel Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , vice president for global policy at Conserv@@ ation International .
The heav@@ y@@ wei@@ ghts are coming .
Britain ’ s first 14@@ 0@@ mp@@ h train to re@@ define that Monday feeling
At 5.@@ 13 on Monday morning a whi@@ st@@ le will p@@ ier@@ ce the dark@@ ness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain .
The first high-speed comm@@ uter train in the country will reach 14@@ 0@@ mp@@ h as it stre@@ aks from Ash@@ ford , K@@ ent , to London St P@@ anc@@ ras , covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes .
Lord Ad@@ on@@ is , the Transport Secretary , will then be joined by Dame Kel@@ ly Hol@@ mes aboard the first Jav@@ el@@ in comm@@ uter service out of London .
He hopes that the new service will eventually plug Britain into an international network of fast , reliable trains and connect the great con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations of the Mid@@ lands , the North and Scotland to London .
Neg@@ l@@ ected back@@ waters would become thri@@ ving comm@@ uter towns , business travel times would be s@@ las@@ hed and the shift from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions as well as easing con@@ ges@@ tion on the roads .
In theory , the three main political parties buy into this vision .
But the tens of billions of po@@ unds needed to build a new national rail network , the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental harm may yet put the bra@@ kes on Britain ’ s high-speed lines .
High Speed Two ( H@@ S@@ 2 ) , a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasi@@ bility study , will hand its report to Lord Ad@@ on@@ is on December 30 , The Times has learnt .
It will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network .
The new line linking London to the West Mid@@ lands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the environmental impact may be con@@ ten@@ tious .
In open country , the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route .
H@@ S@@ 2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network running north .
Lord Ad@@ on@@ is will respond in the spring .
The favoured option being put forward is a Y@@ -@@ shaped configuration in which a single high-speed line would run up to the West Mid@@ lands .
The line would split at or near Birmingham , with one branch running west of the P@@ enn@@ ines to Manchester and Scotland and another running nor@@ theast to Sh@@ eff@@ ield , Le@@ eds and New@@ castle upon Ty@@ ne .
A single line would run into Scotland .
&quot; It looks like it is going to be the best-@@ performing option , &quot; a railway insi@@ der said .
Once complete , journey times between London and Edinburgh would be cut to 2 hours 40 minutes .
The first leg , which would not open before 20@@ 25 , would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes , compared with just over an hour at present .
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 25@@ 0@@ mp@@ h , making the British network the fastest in Europe .
The initial track is being designed to take trains 400@@ m in length capable of carrying 1,@@ 100 people .
As many as 18 could operate each hour on a Lond@@ on-@@ Birmingham line .
That means that a London terminal capable of handling 20@@ ,000 passengers an hour would be needed .
Given space constraints in the capital , it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network .
Rail industry experts say that only St P@@ anc@@ ras International or Eu@@ ston offer that potential .
Lord Ad@@ on@@ is will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should proceed , but lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a general election .
Even if he does put the wheels in motion , the network would have to be built in sections .
Tra@@ ins would at first be forced to run off high-speed lines on to the existing ra@@ ils north of Birmingham , keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours .
That is seen as the crucial ti@@ pping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains , a bench@@ mark for the rail revolution .
Tax@@ pay@@ ers meet mort@@ gage on T@@ ory &apos;s £ 7@@ 5,000 or@@ anger@@ y
Alan Dun@@ can , the fron@@ t@@ ben@@ ch T@@ ory M@@ P , charged the taxpay@@ er thousands of po@@ unds a year towards the cost of an or@@ anger@@ y he built at his constituency home .
The party ’ s pris@@ ons spo@@ kes@@ man , who was dem@@ oted by David Cam@@ eron for compl@@ aining that MP@@ s were living &quot; on r@@ ations &quot; , increased his mort@@ gage by £ 7@@ 5,000 to build an o@@ ak@@ -@@ fr@@ amed extension to his second home in R@@ ut@@ land .
He was allowed to charge the extra interest , tot@@ alling hundreds of po@@ unds a month , to the taxpay@@ er .
The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been qu@@ eri@@ ed by Sir Thomas Leg@@ g , who is conducting a review of members ’ expenses . Last night Mr Dun@@ can said the claims &quot; couldn ’ t be clean@@ er or simpler &quot; .
Mr Dun@@ can , one of the rich@@ est Members of Parliament , owns a two-@@ stor@@ ey house in a village in his R@@ ut@@ land and Mel@@ ton constituency .
H@@ ouses near by have sold for almost a million po@@ unds .
The ground floor comprises a kitchen , living room and dining room , but the fees office agreed that Mr Dun@@ can needed more space .
Last year he added a conserv@@ atory to the house , described in plans as an &quot; or@@ anger@@ y &quot; .
Neigh@@ bo@@ urs described it as a &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse for enter@@ taining &quot; .
Mr Dun@@ can was not required to make any reference to the increased bor@@ rowing during a recent investigation by the Commons ’ Standards and Privi@@ leg@@ es Committee into his previous mort@@ gage ar@@ angem@@ ents .
The committee clear@@ ed him last month of bre@@ aching the rules after an investigation into his expenses .
In 2004 Mr Dun@@ can changed the legal security for a £ 27@@ 1,@@ 4@@ 06 mort@@ gage from his London property to his constituency home , which he had bought in 1991 , the year before he became an M@@ P .
Docum@@ ents released this week show that Mr Dun@@ can was claiming about £ 1,@@ 400 a month in mort@@ gage interest until March last year .
In April , his claims increased to more than £ 1,@@ 800 a month .
The interest rate on Mr Dun@@ can ’ s R@@ BS mort@@ gage did not change in that time , suggest@@ ing that all the increase was to fund the £ 7@@ 5,000 bor@@ rowing .
The R@@ BS standard variable mort@@ gage rate went down from 7.@@ 94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year , where it remains .
The latest document release by the Commons authorities show that Mr Dun@@ can was continuing to claim £ 1,@@ 250 a month this May .
Mr Dun@@ can lost his job as Sha@@ dow Le@@ ader of the House in September after an under@@ cover re@@ porter fil@@ med him saying that MP@@ s had to survive &quot; on r@@ ations &quot; after the expenses scandal .
&quot; Basi@@ cally , it ’ s being nation@@ alised , you have to live on r@@ ations and are treated like s * * t . &quot;
He said : &quot; I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fra@@ ction based on what is proper .
And I could claim the whole bloo@@ dy lot , but I don ’ t . &quot;
The M@@ P , a milli@@ on@@ aire from his former career as an oil tra@@ der , was first challeng@@ ed over his expenses in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of po@@ unds for his garden , before agre@@ eing with the fees office that this &quot; could be considered excessive &quot; .
An activ@@ ist du@@ g a hole in the shape of a po@@ und sign in Mr Dun@@ can ’ s law@@ n in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £ 4@@ ,000 over three years .
A@@ sk@@ ed about the increased mort@@ gage last night , Mr Dun@@ can said : &quot; It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by Leg@@ g . &quot;
He added : &quot; There is no issue of du@@ cking and we@@ aving or pushing the rules or anything .
It is absolutely straight down the line , within the rules , authorised and everything .
It just couldn ’ t in many ways be clean@@ er or simpler . &quot;
Come all ye fai@@ thful to see Bri@@ gh@@ ton ’ s beach h@@ ut Ad@@ vent calendar
Beach hu@@ ts in Bri@@ gh@@ ton have found a new le@@ ase of life for the winter months as an interactive Ad@@ vent calendar .
Beyond , an alternative church group that encourages spiritual expl@@ oration through creativity , invited 24 owners to decor@@ ate their hu@@ ts for each day in December , using Christmas car@@ ols as their theme .
The event started on December 1 , with visitors allowed to view the latest h@@ ut from 5.@@ 30@@ pm to 6.@@ 30@@ pm each day , with min@@ ce p@@ ies and mul@@ led wine laid on for free .
Car@@ ols chosen so far include I Sa@@ w Three Shi@@ ps , O Come , O Come , Em@@ manu@@ el and The First No@@ ë@@ l , where the h@@ ut features the work of Jan@@ ette To@@ zer , a local artist .
Martin Po@@ ole , 50 , a TV marketing assi@@ stant from Ho@@ ve , is a non-@@ sti@@ pen@@ di@@ ary cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man within the Chi@@ chester di@@ oc@@ ese and the leader of Beyond .
He said : &quot; We want to make religion more relevant to people in a post-@@ Christ@@ end@@ om society .
&quot; Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building ? It ’ s my feeling the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways .
&quot; The idea of the beach h@@ ut Ad@@ vent calendar began just as a conversation with some friends over dinner .
Bri@@ gh@@ ton is such a fantas@@ tically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent that through spiritu@@ ality . &quot;
Large climate change gather@@ ings in Copenhagen and around the world
T@@ ens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive agreement in the fight against global warming around the world and in Copenhagen , where police made several hundred arres@@ ts .
At least thirty thousand people , according to police , and a hundred thousand , according to the organis@@ ers , mar@@ ched in the cold in the Danish capital outside the United Nations climate conference , which is t@@ asked with reaching an agreement by Friday that will enter into effect on the 1st of January , 2013 .
For Con@@ nie He@@ de@@ ga@@ ard , the Danish climate conference president , the increasing number of climate r@@ allies around the world , illustr@@ ated by these protests , has contributed to making the &apos; political cost &apos; of a failure in Copenhagen very high .
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the main proc@@ ession , when a group of 300 protes@@ ters , clo@@ th@@ ed entirely in black , broke shop windows with p@@ aving and h@@ amm@@ ers , observed a re@@ porter from the AF@@ P .
Ri@@ ot police provided an immediate and un@@ hes@@ it@@ ant response .
Police announced a total of 600 to 700 hundred arres@@ ts , with most , they report , being members of the &apos; Black Blo@@ cks &apos; ; small ultra-@@ violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg , in the East of France , in April .
The Climate Justice Action ( C@@ J@@ A ) coalition , one of the protest organis@@ ers , reported conditions whereby hundreds of protes@@ ters were arrested &quot; without discrimination , &quot; highlighting that a hundred of them &quot; were still det@@ ained in the street on Saturday night &quot; hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold &quot; .
Having left the Parliament , the proc@@ ession headed in an or@@ derly fashion towards the B@@ ella Center , where negotiations were to take place .
The protes@@ ters stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter .
A stage had been raised to receive the expected speakers before a cand@@ l@@ el@@ it vi@@ gi@@ l , in which the former South African Arch@@ bish@@ op from Cape Town , Des@@ mond Tut@@ u would be taking part .
The majority of protes@@ ters had arrived by coach and train from the major European cities , but many Asian protes@@ ters , including some Chinese and Korean , were also present , as well as those from Africa .
Around 3000 people , mainly cla@@ d in sky blue rain@@ co@@ ats , had formed an initial r@@ ally in Copenhagen during the morning , called by Friends of the Earth , who were planning &quot; blue waves &quot; for &quot; climate justice &quot; .
We are mar@@ ching on the streets today to demand repar@@ ations of the ecological debt for the South , explained Li@@ dy N@@ ac@@ p@@ il , a Fili@@ p@@ ino activ@@ ist in the Ju@@ bi@@ lee South Co@@ alition in Copenhagen .
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left , ass@@ esses the singer from Ben@@ in , Angel@@ i@@ que K@@ id@@ jo .
There are rivers dr@@ ying out in Africa ; water courses , where it is possible to walk and never was before .
For the first time in the history of Climate Diplom@@ acy , born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention , the anti-@@ globalisation movement has brought itself closer to environmental organisations .
The French Euro@@ dep@@ uty , José Bo@@ v@@ é , a face of anti-@@ globalisation , explained that he has come to Copenhagen to &quot; connect climate justice with social justice &quot; : &quot; Today there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the anti-@@ globalisation fight . &quot;
The Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific region , which is home to numerous islands , which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming , had k@@ ic@@ ked off the protests .
According to organis@@ ers , some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia .
In Man@@ ila , several hundred people , mostly students , par@@ aded in red , bran@@ dish@@ ing bann@@ ers about the benefits of solar energy .
In Hong Kong , D@@ j@@ ak@@ arta , and in Canada , r@@ allies of several hundred demonstr@@ ators were also formed to demand more for@@ ceful action against climate change .
In France , the protests organised by the &quot; 350 &quot; network brought together several hundred people , notably in Paris , Mar@@ sei@@ ll@@ es ( in the South ) , L@@ ille ( in the North ) , Bor@@ deaux ( in the West ) , and Lyon ( in the East ) .
In Geneva , doz@@ ens of people gathered .
Se@@ par@@ ati@@ st Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia has elected its president ; Georgia calls it a &quot; far@@ ce &quot;
Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia elected its president on Saturday , a little over a year after Moscow &apos;s recognition of the pro-@@ Russian region of Georgia , while T@@ bili@@ si calls it a &quot; far@@ ce &quot; .
Some 13@@ 1 000 people were called on to take part in this first vote following the Georgi@@ a-@@ Russia war in August 2008 for the control of South Os@@ se@@ tia , another sec@@ es@@ sion@@ ist Georgi@@ an territory recognised by Russia .
The poll@@ ing stations closed at 17 : 00 GM@@ T .
Att@@ end@@ ance was at 58 % a few hours before closure , according to Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an electoral Commission officials .
The first pro@@ visi@@ onal results were to be announced during the night between Saturday and Sunday .
The five candidates in the running , among whom the existing president , S@@ erg@@ ei Bag@@ ap@@ sh , all categ@@ or@@ ically reject the idea of a re@@ unification with Georgia , which has condemned the holding of the vote .
These elections are a far@@ ce .
For his part , the Georgi@@ an president , Mi@@ k@@ hei@@ l Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vi@@ li , &quot; reg@@ rets that Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia has fallen under total Russian occupation , &quot; declared his spo@@ kes@@ woman , Man@@ ana Man@@ j@@ gal@@ ad@@ ze .
Other than Russia , only Nic@@ ar@@ agua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the territory &apos;s 2@@ 16 000 inhabitants , while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops .
After separ@@ ating itself from Georgia in the 199@@ 2-@@ 1993 conflict , which saw the loss of several thousand lives , Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia is trying to show , by means of this election , that it is ready to join the international community .
This process is a stage in our new life , our new era as an independent state , declared Sv@@ et@@ lan@@ a K@@ v@@ arch@@ ia , a 5@@ 4-@@ year-old hist@@ orian , who confirms having voted for M@@ ister Bag@@ ap@@ sh .
She was among the voters who came to the poll@@ ing station in an attractive white school building with several pal@@ m trees at the front in the capital , Sou@@ k@@ hou@@ mi .
The question of the Russian dom@@ ination is at the heart of the presidential debate , in this region gi@@ fted with a lush landscape on the Black Sea .
V@@ ast b@@ ill@@ boards showing M@@ ister Bag@@ ap@@ sh beside the Russian President and Prime Minister , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev and V@@ ladimir Putin , are dot@@ ted around this small territory of 2@@ 16 000 inhabitants .
In Gal@@ i , in the West of the country , the Chief of District , Bes@@ lan Arch@@ ba , reserved a very warm welcome for the Russian officials who came to over@@ see the voting .
We , the Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an people , are th@@ ank@@ ful , he said during a small ceremony , all@@ u@@ ding to the support from Moscow , and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations , rep@@ lied Alex@@ ei Ost@@ rov@@ sky , a member of the Russian Parliament , while raising his glass of vod@@ ka .
For their part , the opposition represented in the vote by the former vic@@ e-@@ president Ra@@ oul K@@ ha@@ d@@ j@@ im@@ ba and two business@@ men , Z@@ a@@ ous Ar@@ d@@ zin@@ ba and Bes@@ lan B@@ out@@ ba , critic@@ ises the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year , such as the one giving Russia control of the Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an rail network for the next 10 years .
The fifth candidate , Vit@@ ali B@@ gan@@ ba , asser@@ ts not being in support of the current Government or the opposition .
50 % plus one vote is the majority required to win the vote .
If no candidate at@@ tains this threshold , a second vote must be organised within two weeks .
Climate : demonstrations around the world , incidents in Copenhagen .
T@@ ens of thousands of people the world over mar@@ ched on Saturday to demand an ambitious and restrictive agreement at the Climate Conference in Copenhagen , where police were on alert and arrested almost 700 people on the fr@@ ing@@ es of an imposing r@@ ally .
Thir@@ ty thousand people , according to police , a hundred thousand , according to organis@@ ers , par@@ aded in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital , which is receiving deleg@@ ates from 19@@ 3 countries until the 18th of December , who will be seeking to conclude an agreement to come into effect by the 1st of January , 2013 .
Having left the Parliament , the proc@@ ession headed in a generally or@@ derly fashion for the B@@ ella Center , where negotiations were to take place .
The demonstr@@ ators stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter .
A stage had been er@@ ected to accommodate the speakers , before a cand@@ l@@ el@@ it vi@@ gi@@ l , with the participation of former South African Cape Town arch@@ bish@@ op , Des@@ mond Tut@@ u .
A few moments after the departure of the proc@@ ession , a group of several hundred demonstr@@ ators , cla@@ d entirely in black and holding bri@@ cks and h@@ amm@@ ers , broke shop windows , re@@ marked an AF@@ P re@@ porter .
Ri@@ ot police immediately surrounded them and interven@@ ed in no uncertain terms , thro@@ wing several of them to the ground .
Police announced the arres@@ ts of 600 to 700 hundred people , adding that they were mainly members of the &apos; Black Blo@@ cks &apos; ; small ultra-@@ violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg , in the East of France , in April .
T@@ ow@@ ards the end of the afternoon a polic@@ em@@ an was injured on the ja@@ w by a piece of p@@ aving and four cars were set ali@@ ght near a squ@@ at during a series of incidents , which led to the arres@@ ts of some twenty people , according to police .
We have our eye on the small extrem@@ ist groups , police spo@@ kes@@ man Hen@@ rik Jak@@ ob@@ sen warned , as the force &apos;s helicop@@ ters cir@@ c@@ led in the sky above .
The majority of demonstr@@ ators were of European origin , arriving in co@@ aches and trains from the main German cities , from London , from Amsterdam , and also from Milan .
Large numbers of Asi@@ ans , including a few Chinese and Kor@@ e@@ ans , were also present , as were some Afri@@ cans .
Around 3000 people , mainly cla@@ d in sky blue rain@@ co@@ ats , had formed an initial r@@ ally in Copenhagen during the morning called by Friends of the Earth , who were planning &quot; blue waves &quot; for &quot; climate justice &quot; .

Histor@@ y-@@ Ge@@ ography are strengthened by the secondary schools reform , according to Chat@@ el
French Education Minister , Lu@@ c Chat@@ el , declared in an interview to be published in the French Paper On Sunday ( J@@ D@@ D ) that History and Ge@@ ography were &quot; reinforced &quot; by the secondary schools reform , despite them no longer being obligatory subjects for the French technical Six@@ th Form .
From now on , first year pupils will have four hours per week , and the same programme for a common shared culture , states Mr. Chat@@ el .
According to the minister , &quot; We need to get out of this hypo@@ cris@@ y &quot; because , he says , &quot; the &apos; S &apos; course of study is no longer the science course &quot; , but &quot; more generally , it is a magn@@ et for the stronger pupils &quot; .
The &apos; ES &apos; and &apos; L &apos; courses cannot remain inf@@ erior choices behind the &apos; S &apos; course , he continues , highlighting that &quot; I have not heard many hist@@ ori@@ ans or academ@@ ics expressing indi@@ gn@@ ance at the absence of Histor@@ y-@@ Ge@@ ography in the technical Six@@ th For@@ ms either . &quot;
On Saturday , an IF@@ O@@ P ( French Public Op@@ inion Institute ) pol@@ l appearing in L &apos;@@ Human@@ ité revealed that nearly seven out of ten ( 69 % ) French people dis@@ approved of the Government project to termin@@ ate compulsory teaching of Histor@@ y-@@ Ge@@ ography in technical Six@@ th For@@ ms . Many academ@@ ics and teachers also criticised this sup@@ pression , as have the left and some right-@@ wing representatives .
On the other hand , the minister added that there was &quot; no question &quot; of eliminating the &apos; S &apos; course philosophy .
Lu@@ c Chat@@ el also defended the teachers &apos; education reforms , just as 16 organisations ( students and associations ) called for a day of protest on Tuesday to demonstrate against the project , which , in their opinion , sacrific@@ es the educational training of future teachers .
For 2nd year Master &apos;s ( M@@ 2 ) , an entry ex@@ am focusing on the candidate &apos;s discipline will be required at the start of the year , and an acceptance ex@@ am testing their capacity to teach will be held at the end of the year , the minister explained .
Furthermore , they will cover in-@@ class plac@@ ements throughout the M@@ 2 year , and will then be in front of pupils for a year as student teachers .
If you add up all the placement work proposed before the ex@@ am you already end up with more presence in front of students , which equ@@ ates to over 300 hours , he continued .
Finally , the minister indicates that he will be putting forward &quot; the individual &apos;s right to education ; something that does not exist in national Education &quot; .
He also reaffir@@ ms the plan to abo@@ lish the school map &quot; by 2012 &quot; .
At Nor@@ male Sup@@ é@@ rie@@ ure ( one of France &apos;s top schools ) , experts have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate
Fif@@ teen minutes to talk about what is at stake at the Copenhagen summit : that was the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean J@@ ou@@ zel , vic@@ e-@@ president of the intergovernmental group of Climate Evolution experts ( G@@ I@@ EC ) invited by the E@@ col@@ e Nor@@ male Sup@@ é@@ rie@@ ure in rue d &apos;@@ Ul@@ m ( Paris ) .
Jean J@@ ou@@ zel , Nobel Peace Prize winner , inau@@ gur@@ ated the first of the conferences entitled &quot; Ern@@ est &quot; , a day composed of a series of 15-@@ minute lec@@ tures from experts , fil@@ med and open to the public , noted an AF@@ P re@@ porter .
We wanted to do something to catch people &apos;s attention and make them want to find out more , explained one of the day &apos;s organis@@ ers , 2@@ 2-@@ year-old E@@ dou@@ ard Han@@ ne@@ zo , outside the conference ; this having been named after the name given to the fish in the school &apos;s p@@ ond .
We choose around twenty lec@@ tur@@ ers among the experts in their field and the more char@@ is@@ m@@ atic ones are selected , he added .
On the subject of global warming , &quot; we could go on for hours , but we can also cover the key objectives in a few minutes &quot; , Jean J@@ ou@@ zel told the AF@@ P , who made his presentation without notes , but with graphical ai@@ ds , to an audience of around fif@@ ty .
This is part of our scienti@@ st &apos;s role , he emphasised , hoping that listen@@ ers will remember that &quot; the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely solid scientific case &quot; .
The video foot@@ age from the conferences will be available online on the school &apos;s website starting the 15th of December .
The next &quot; Ern@@ est &quot; day is planned for February , followed by others on a b@@ im@@ on@@ thly basis .
L@@ ate payments : anger from prison gu@@ ards , action planned
P@@ ris@@ on guard unions called for a &quot; general r@@ ally &quot; on Friday to demand payment of their bon@@ uses and over@@ time before the end of the year holidays , having seen it pushed into January for budgetary reasons .
F@@ O-@@ p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire ( 2nd prison guard union ) has requested that staff , who are not on duty , demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to &quot; block &quot; them , in order to &quot; ex@@ pose the th@@ eft of their earnings &quot; .
The C@@ G@@ T-@@ p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire ( 3rd union in the profession ) calls for them to &quot; unite in general , r@@ all@@ ying at the various pris@@ ons , to show a strong tur@@ n-@@ out &quot; , condemn the non-@@ payment of &quot; over@@ time , ni@@ ght-@@ shift bon@@ uses , Sunday and holiday pay &quot; in December for their work in October as &quot; sham@@ eful and unacceptable &quot; .
And the first prison guard union , Union f@@ é@@ dé@@ rale aut@@ on@@ ome p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire ( U@@ F@@ AP / UN@@ SA ) , &quot; calls for general r@@ all@@ ying ( … ) to re-@@ aw@@ aken the dis@@ content and anger &quot; .
The pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary administration &apos;s Management and the Justice Ministry explain that over@@ time has increased considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget , but ass@@ ures that the outstanding balances will be settled in January .
The Chan@@ cer@@ y stated near the end of the day that Mich@@ è@@ le Alli@@ ot-@@ Marie had sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month .
I am not ign@@ oring the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system , writes the Minister of Justice in this communication .
I have asked the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary administration Management to put in place , without delay , a set of measures to ensure that this situation , caused by a poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours , does not repeat itself in the future , adds Mr@@ s. Alli@@ ot-@@ Marie .
The December pay pack@@ et will therefore be sli@@ m , except for management staff , who benefit from the so-called target and position@@ -@@ related bon@@ uses , critics the U@@ F@@ AP / UN@@ SA , saying &quot; budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse &quot; .
It is an absolute scandal , compl@@ ains the inter-@@ regional union from Mar@@ sei@@ ll@@ es , announc@@ ing its decision to boy@@ cot@@ t &quot; all meetings and conv@@ oc@@ ations &quot; until further notice .
Staff will not be putting in Sunday or holiday hours if the October ones are not settled in December , and the same goes for over@@ time , threatens the Rh@@ ô@@ ne-@@ Alp@@ es-@@ Au@@ ver@@ g@@ ne trade union .
At a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded , but our staff numbers are not , it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff &apos;s salaries , judges the C@@ G@@ T-@@ p@@ é@@ nit@@ enti@@ aire de Bor@@ deaux .
According to the unions , the situation is not the same in all regions , with some being worse off than others .
But in any case , the balance is not there , ob@@ serves Jean-@@ Franç@@ ois For@@ get , general secret@@ ary of U@@ F@@ AP .
For Christmas , Obama says he gives &quot; nic@@ er stuff &quot; than he receives
The American President , Barack Obama , who is preparing for his first family Christmas at the White House , intim@@ ates to TV icon O@@ pra@@ h Win@@ fre@@ y that he has one simple rule when it comes to presents : &quot; I give nic@@ er stuff than I get &quot; .
In a special programme to be broadcast on the AB@@ C channel on Sunday evening , the president and his wife , Mich@@ elle , offer an insight into the way they plan to celebrate the end of year fes@@ tivities in their prestigious new home .
Even B@@ o , the family &apos;s little four-@@ leg@@ ged friend , will be joining in .
Santa Cl@@ aus lo@@ ves B@@ o too , maintains Mich@@ elle Obama , adding that the dog would &quot; naturally &quot; have a present , according to the programme &apos;s advertising tra@@ iler .
And Mich@@ elle Obama f@@ eign@@ ed indi@@ gn@@ ance , counter@@ ing her husband &apos;s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives : &quot; No way ; I gave you good gifts last year &quot; , she te@@ ased the President .
Absol@@ utely , he had to conc@@ ede before j@@ ok@@ ingly re@@ tor@@ ting : &quot; Who gave you this ? &quot; , pointing at the First Lady &apos;s pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ kl@@ ace .
During this ho@@ ur@@ -@@ long ligh@@ t-@@ hear@@ ted programme with the famous present@@ er , who was a fer@@ vent Barack Obama suppor@@ ter during the presidential campaign , the president and his wife also rec@@ alled their favourite childhood presents .
Barack Obama remembered a ten-@@ speed bicycle , but also a bas@@ ketball that his Ken@@ yan father , whom he had rarely seen , had given him for Christmas .
I remember a time when I met my father , who had come to visit us for Christmas , and he gave me a bas@@ ketball , said the president .
It was only much later in my life that I realised that he had given me the ball .
The First Lady , for her part , rec@@ alled her d@@ oll@@ house .
I had no idea how to organise a house , so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall , rather than arran@@ ging them around the fireplace , but I ad@@ ored that little d@@ oll@@ house , said Mich@@ elle Obama .
John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day re-@@ operated on , RT@@ L claims he is in artificial com@@ a
John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day was re-@@ operated on in Los Angeles due to significant &quot; les@@ ions &quot; after an operation in France , but the situation is &quot; under control &quot; according to his ent@@ our@@ age , while RT@@ L claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial com@@ a to avoid pain and complic@@ ations .
The 6@@ 6-@@ year-old ro@@ cker was re-@@ operated on in the night between Wednesday and Thursday at the C@@ ed@@ ar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted &quot; les@@ ions resulting from the operation &quot; for the sli@@ pped disc under@@ gone in Paris on November 26@@ th , his press office announced in Paris , adding that the les@@ ions had &quot; warran@@ ted a repair operation &quot; .
The singer &apos;s press office , however , wanted to be re@@ ass@@ uring , stating that the situation was &quot; under control &quot; , while announc@@ ing that a new medical bul@@ le@@ tin would be communic@@ ated within 48 hours .
According to RT@@ L , partner for the singer &apos;s first tour , however , John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day may have been put into an artificial com@@ a to avoid &quot; pain and complic@@ ations &quot; .
It will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient , once he has at least one eye open , added RT@@ L .
When ques@@ tioned by the AF@@ P , the press office neither confirmed , nor comm@@ ented on the information .
RT@@ L also claims that &quot; according to certain sources &quot; , no dra@@ in was fitted after the first operation in Paris .
The ro@@ cker had been operated on for a sli@@ pped disc at the international clin@@ ic at Parc Mon@@ ce@@ au .
The operation , scheduled several days in advance , had been carried out by the neur@@ o-@@ sur@@ ge@@ on St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x , a well-known doctor in artist circles .
He was not available to comment on RT@@ L &apos;s information on Thursday evening .
Following the operation that he carried out on John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day , the singer was taken on Monday to the C@@ ed@@ ar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital for an infection st@@ em@@ ming from the operation .
The singer , Ed@@ dy Mitch@@ ell , a close friend of John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day , said on RT@@ L on Thursday that his friend was going through &quot; a bad patch &quot; , but assured everyone that he had &quot; no wor@@ ries &quot; about the ro@@ cker , who is a &quot; figh@@ ter &quot; .
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles , and I told him that it was cra@@ zy , because taking a 12-@@ hour flight after that kind of operation is not realistic , said Ed@@ dy Mitch@@ ell .
Wednesday evening , the singer &apos;s producer , Jean-@@ Claude Cam@@ us , had wanted to be re@@ ass@@ uring , stating that John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day &quot; was re@@ acting satisfac@@ t@@ ori@@ ly to the antibio@@ tics &quot; and that the infection was being &quot; contained &quot; .
Mr. Cam@@ us had also said to have spoken with La@@ e@@ ti@@ cia , the singer &apos;s wife , and not to have noticed any signs of worry .
But health problems for the singer have only multip@@ lied since he was hospit@@ alised for nine days in July after a fall on his yacht .
Two months later , to the surprise of all , John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day had revealed having had a &quot; minor col@@ onic cancer &quot; operation , then a slight infection .
At the end of September , the singer resumed as planned his long &quot; Tour 66 &quot; , b@@ illed as his final good@@ by@@ e tour .
However , since then , every health problem is heavily comm@@ ented on . Fans and re@@ por@@ ters have noticed the singer &apos;s trouble in moving around on stage .
In mid-@@ November , his ent@@ our@@ age even had to deny further hospit@@ alisation .
Euro-@@ 2009 / short course : B@@ ous@@ quet &apos;s first in his lucky distance
The Fren@@ ch@@ man , Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ri@@ ck B@@ ous@@ quet , triple med@@ al-@@ holder in the long course 2009 World Championship , pul@@ led off an international title for a distance he particularly fav@@ ours , the 50@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle , at the Euro-@@ 2009 short course event in Istanbul on Thursday .
The first day of this competition , where full-@@ length swi@@ m@@ suits are permitted for the last time , has seen only three world records be@@ aten , whereas a wave of them was expected .
One record was improved on by the Hungarian , E@@ vel@@ yn Ver@@ ras@@ z@@ to , 200@@ m m@@ edly , and the two others by Russia in the 4@@ x@@ 50@@ m m@@ edly rel@@ ay .
A regret for B@@ ous@@ quet , who had his sight set on the 50@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle world record , for which he holds the long course title ( 20.@@ 94 ) .
In one of the two high-@@ profile swimming events , the 50@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle , it was the 28@@ -@@ year-old Fren@@ ch@@ man who made his mark with a time of 20.@@ 53 in a final , where ten swi@@ mm@@ ers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level .
B@@ ous@@ quet best@@ ed the Cro@@ at , Du@@ je Dra@@ gan@@ ja ( 20.@@ 70 ) and the Russian , Ser@@ ge@@ y Fes@@ i@@ ko@@ v ( 20.@@ 84 ) , but he did not manage to reduce the world record time ( 20.@@ 30 ) as he had envisaged .
One can always dream of better , and I had actually stated that , if the world record was in my reach , I would certainly attempt it .
Like B@@ ous@@ quet , the vast majority of swi@@ mm@@ ers were in poly@@ ur@@ eth@@ ane swi@@ m@@ suits , which will not be permitted starting the 1st of January .
Having un@@ le@@ ashed 23@@ 8 world records since February 2008 , these swi@@ m@@ suits will end their ep@@ ic story in Istanbul , which had also seen the first ones in 1999 , during the same competition .
The use of these swi@@ m@@ suits did not assist the German , Rome &apos;s long course two-@@ time world champion this summer , Paul B@@ ieder@@ mann , on this occasion , where world records were at stake .
The young swi@@ mmer did not succeed in reducing the record he currently holds in the 400@@ m fre@@ est@@ yle ( 3 : 3@@ 2.@@ 77 ) , but did , nevertheless , make an impression by achieving his second personal best time ( 3 : 3@@ 4.@@ 55 ) , ahead of the Russian , Ni@@ kit@@ a Lob@@ in@@ ts@@ ev ( 3 : 3@@ 5.@@ 75 ) and the Dan@@ e , Mad@@ s G@@ la@@ es@@ ner ( 3 : 3@@ 6.@@ 82 ) .
I did not give it my all in this race .
I knew that I could not achieve a world record , but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission .
Lob@@ in@@ ts@@ ev will be a strong ri@@ val in the future , explained B@@ ieder@@ mann .
USA : a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g@@ us panel belonging to Z@@ ola f@@ et@@ ches 1.5 million USD
A Roman sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g@@ us panel , which had notably belong@@ ed to the French writer , E@@ mile Z@@ ola , f@@ et@@ ched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday , a significantly higher figure than was estimated , announced art auction house So@@ th@@ eby &apos;s .
This front panel , measuring two metres in length and 6@@ 3@@ cm in height , dating back to the 3rd century AD , was valued at 150@@ ,000 to 25@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars .
The marble &quot; depic@@ ting four Di@@ ony@@ sian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor , surrounded by sat@@ yr@@ s and bac@@ ch@@ antes , is a rare piece ; there are only five of them in the world &quot; , Flor@@ ent Hein@@ tz , vic@@ e-@@ president of art auc@@ tions for Roman and Egyptian anti@@ qui@@ ties , had explained to the AF@@ P on Tuesday .
It was sold among around a hundred other lots .
The auction is still going on , but this lot is certainly the one , which has got bu@@ yers bi@@ d@@ ding most so far , comm@@ ented So@@ th@@ eby &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man to the AF@@ P , D@@ an Aber@@ ne@@ thy .
The discovery of E@@ mile Z@@ ola &apos;s acquisition of this marble piece dates back some time .
The panel remained in the famous collection of the Bor@@ gh@@ ese family in Rome for nearly 300 years , then it succ@@ essively appeared with the French act@@ ress , C@@ é@@ ci@@ le Sor@@ el , who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris man@@ sion , then Paul Re@@ yn@@ aud , a minister in France &apos;s 3rd Republic and briefly the Council &apos;s chairman before Mar@@ sh@@ al Pé@@ tain &apos;s accession to power .
That left a grey area of about fif@@ ty years .
By searching the Louvre Museum &apos;s database , Flor@@ ent Hein@@ tz discovered that the panel was part of an &quot; E@@ mile Z@@ ola inher@@ it@@ ance &quot; opened in 19@@ 03 , a year after the death of the author of &quot; Th@@ ér@@ è@@ se Ra@@ qu@@ in &quot; and the series of &quot; Rou@@ g@@ on-@@ Mac@@ qu@@ art &quot; no@@ vels .
Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s departure attempt from Hon@@ dur@@ as to Mexico abor@@ ted
Mexico judged on Thursday that conditions were no longer suitable for the transfer into its territory of the de@@ posed Hon@@ dur@@ an president , Manuel Z@@ el@@ aya , who had been refused safe passage by the cou@@ p-@@ installed Government .
At the moment , after a telephone conversation in the night with president Z@@ el@@ aya , everything seems to indicate that the potential options for carrying out this transfer are not suitable , declared the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Patri@@ cia Esp@@ ino@@ sa .
Having arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya , the Mexican Government plane returned to its original location , according to a source from the General Direc@@ torate of Migr@@ ations .
The Cou@@ p Government had wanted to force Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya to &quot; res@@ ign &quot; and had requested a foreign asylum to allow him safe passage to .
But the president refused , because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the inc@@ umb@@ ent Head of State and an invited guest .
The Cou@@ p Government &quot; has again met with failure by wanting me to give up my duties ( ... ) ; they wanted me to res@@ ign &quot; , Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya told radio Glob@@ o on Thursday , through which he often makes himself heard , since the beginning of the political crisis , which has so far la@@ sted five months in this country of Central America .
I could stay here ten years , I have my guitar here , added the de@@ posed president while playing a few ch@@ ords , having taken refuge at the Brazilian Em@@ bass@@ y in T@@ egu@@ ci@@ g@@ alp@@ a for the last two and a half months .
The Mexican Em@@ bass@@ y presented us with a request for safe passage , but , unfortunately , we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request , the Cou@@ p Government Inter@@ ior Minister , O@@ scar Rau@@ l Mat@@ ute , had declared on Wednesday on Hon@@ dur@@ an HR@@ N radio .
I am not requesting asylum from any country , Manuel Z@@ el@@ aya had answered in an interview on the Tel@@ es@@ ur channel , based in Car@@ ac@@ as .
Any departure from Hon@@ dur@@ as would have to be as the president of the Hon@@ dur@@ an people , he had emphasised .
The ru@@ mo@@ urs of Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s departure had , on Wednesday , mobili@@ sed the parti@@ s@@ ans of the de@@ posed president , who gathered around the Brazilian Em@@ bass@@ y , where military forces reinforced their position .
The Brazilian Foreign Minister , Cel@@ so Am@@ or@@ im , criticised the Cou@@ p Government &apos;s position .
This demonstrates the margin@@ al character of this Government in relation with international standards , he asser@@ ted .
Z@@ el@@ aya , who had become closer with the socialist Venezu@@ el@@ an president , Hu@@ go Cha@@ vez , had been over@@ turned on June 28@@ th , the day he had organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-@@ election , going against the views of the Supreme Court , the Army and Congress .
Ex@@ iled to Costa Rica , he had made a surprise return on September 21st and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Em@@ bass@@ y .
If he comes out , he will be arrested to answer to charges of &quot; high treas@@ on &quot; , which the Law acc@@ uses him of , according to the Cou@@ p Government .
The Cou@@ p President , Rober@@ to Michel@@ etti , has managed to organise a presidential election on the 29@@ th of November to replace Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya .
Por@@ fi@@ ri@@ o Lob@@ o was elected in the controversial vote , which was recognised by the United States , but was cont@@ ested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela , Argentina , and Brazil .
Three days later , Congress voted by a land@@ slide against Mr. Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s return to power for the remain@@ der of his term up to January 27@@ th .
Wall Street rises , the commercial balance of the US feeds optim@@ ism
The New York Stock Exchange finished higher on Thursday , as American commercial equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um figures indicate a return of activity in the United States and with its partners : the D@@ ow gained 0.@@ 67 % , and the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q 0.@@ 33 % .
According to the final closing figures , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rose by 6@@ 8.@@ 78 points to 10 40@@ 5.@@ 83 points , and the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q , with a technology domin@@ ance , rose by 7.@@ 13 points to 2 19@@ 0.@@ 06 points .
The broader Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s 500 index had a result of 0.@@ 58 % ( 6.@@ 40 points ) taking it to 1 10@@ 2.@@ 35 points .
We have good news coming from various sides of the Economy , assessed Lin@@ d@@ sey Pi@@ eg@@ za from FT@@ N Financial .
However , this remains an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al evidence , she cau@@ tioned , suggest@@ ing the market was focusing on &quot; the glass being half full &quot; .
Peter Cardi@@ ll@@ o of A@@ val@@ on Partners thinks that investors have concentrated particularly on America &apos;s commercial balance figures , &quot; which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter &quot; .
The US commercial deficit dropped by 7.@@ 6 % in October , compared to September , to 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion dollars .
An@@ alyst@@ s were expecting the opposite , a deep@@ ening of the deficit .
Both imports and exports increased .
The big news is the increase in trade volumes , especially in the export of goods , which reflects the economical growth of the commercial partners of the United States , comm@@ ented Christop@@ her Corn@@ ell from the research company Econom@@ y@@ .com.
In contrast , new unemployment claims in the United States have increased beyond all expectations in the past week , to reach 4@@ 74 000 claims .
However , in the last four weeks , the average number of new employment seekers &quot; has fallen to its lowest in a year &quot; , highlighted Scott Mar@@ cou@@ iller from Well@@ s Far@@ go Ad@@ vis@@ ors .
The bond market has fallen .
Treas@@ ury 10-@@ year bond yiel@@ ds have grown to 3.@@ 4@@ 82 % against 3.@@ 4@@ 23 % on Tuesday evening , and 30-@@ year bond yiel@@ ds are at 4.@@ 4@@ 92 % against 4.@@ 4@@ 08 % the previous evening .
Cuba : hundreds of Government supporters speak out against the &quot; Ladies in White &quot;
Several hundred Cuban pro-@@ government demonstr@@ ators spoke out on Thursday against political prisoners &apos; wi@@ ves , who had gathered in Hav@@ ana for International Human Rights Day , and prevented another demonstration , for which around a do@@ zen dis@@ si@@ dents were arrested .
Around for@@ ty &quot; White Ladies &quot; , wi@@ ves and those close to the political prisoners , were je@@ ered at in the street by supporters of Rau@@ l Castro &apos;s government as they were mar@@ ching towards the centre of the capital to demand the liber@@ ation of the political prisoners , observed an AF@@ P re@@ porter .
D@@ own with the Y@@ anks ! , &quot; Merc@@ en@@ aries ! &quot; , &quot; The street belongs to the Revolu@@ tion@@ aries ! &quot; , &quot; Long live Fi@@ del and Rau@@ l ! &quot; the pro-@@ government supporters chan@@ ted at the dis@@ si@@ dents , their fi@@ sts raised .
These latter were es@@ cor@@ ted by pla@@ inc@@ lo@@ thes agents , who had come to &quot; ensure their protection &quot; .
The previous evening , a similar demonstration had taken place against the &quot; Ladies in White &quot; in Hav@@ ana without anyone being injured or arrested .
However , in the V@@ ed@@ ado district of Hav@@ ana , a do@@ zen dis@@ si@@ dents , who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day , were arrested by pla@@ inc@@ lo@@ thes police , reported an AF@@ P journalist .
The polic@@ emen made the dis@@ si@@ dents , who had been je@@ ered at by pro-@@ government supporters , get into un@@ marked vehicles , according to the journalist .
Dis@@ si@@ dent arres@@ ts under similar circumstances normally only last a few hours .
R@@ eci@@ pi@@ ents of the 2005 Sak@@ har@@ ov Prize from the European Parliament , the &quot; Ladies in White &quot; had organised a non-@@ authorised mar@@ ch to &quot; demand the release of all political prisoners &quot; , tot@@ alling 200 according to the dis@@ si@@ dent side , declared one of their leaders , La@@ ura Poll@@ an , whose husband , H@@ ector Mac@@ eda , is serving a 20-@@ year sentence in prison .
Mr. Mac@@ eda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dis@@ si@@ dents arrested in March 2003 , 53 of which remain behind bars .
The Cuban authorities consider the opposition as &quot; mer@@ cen@@ aries &quot; or &quot; agents &quot; on the books of their s@@ worn enemy , the United States .
Un@@ usually , Cuban television covered the demonstration of pro-@@ government supporters against the &quot; anti-@@ revolution@@ aries &quot; on Thursday .
Cuba , lead by a single party , the Communist Party , is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of fl@@ ou@@ ting rights and liber@@ ties , notably those of the freedom of expression .
A ma@@ d@@ man k@@ ills an ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old with a kni@@ fe and wo@@ unds 5 at C@@ lich@@ y-@@ la-@@ Gar@@ enne
A cra@@ zed man armed with two kni@@ ves has killed a man in his eigh@@ ties and wo@@ unded five other people in the city centre of C@@ lich@@ y-@@ la-@@ Gar@@ enne ( Hau@@ ts@@ -@@ de@@ -S@@ eine ) , during r@@ ush hour , towards the end of Thursday .
We have learned from witn@@ esses and from police that , according to the investigation &apos;s initial findings , the attack@@ er , aged 28 , appears to have struck an ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old with two kni@@ ves for reasons that remain unclear , in or at the front of a pharm@@ acy at 85 Bou@@ levard Jean-@@ J@@ aur@@ ès .
Having sustained severe wo@@ unds , the elderly man , born in 19@@ 29 according to the police union , Alliance , died from his in@@ jur@@ ies in the hospital .
In or in front of the same pharm@@ acy , he then began att@@ acking a couple , including a pregn@@ ant woman .
The husband , aged around thirty , came between them and was wo@@ unded .
The first two victims , gra@@ vely wo@@ unded , were admitted to the hospital , where the ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old man died .
The days of the other injured person may be num@@ ber@@ ed , as vital organs have apparently been affected , according to police sources .
The pregn@@ ant woman was subsequently taken ill and was hospit@@ alised &quot; in a state of shock &quot; , according to one police source .
The armed man , who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs , according to a police source , fl@@ ed into the street along Bou@@ levard Jean J@@ aur@@ ès .
He is reported to have wo@@ unded two p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by , apparently at random : one thir@@ ty-@@ year-old , and one fort@@ y-@@ year-old , the latter severely .
By the evening , the scenario remained unclear .
He was armed with two but@@ cher &apos;s kni@@ ves that he carried cross@@ ed on his back , explained Arn@@ aud Pres@@ sé at the scene , an officer from the Alliance union of Hau@@ ts@@ -@@ de@@ -S@@ eine .
Several p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by , including some yo@@ ungst@@ ers , attempted to over@@ power the ma@@ d@@ man , according to witness reports collected by the AF@@ P .
I saw a guy of about thirty with a green jack@@ et .
Three you@@ ths tried to intervene .
They could not manage it , because the guy was well-@@ built , re@@ counted Alber@@ to , a server in a nearby bar .
A crowd fell on him , including a town polic@@ em@@ an , who broke his wr@@ ist , he added .
Still on Jean-@@ J@@ aur@@ ès Bou@@ levard , outside number 61 , two town polic@@ emen , one of whom was the chief , attempted to arrest the armed man and were injured by pun@@ ches , according to police sources .
The events took place on one of C@@ lich@@ y-@@ la-@@ Gar@@ enne &apos;s main streets , where many local businesses operate .
Some p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by came to tell me that there was someone injured outside .
I went out , saw a 7@@ 0-@@ year-old on the ground , put the person in the recovery position , then I noticed a severe wo@@ und on the ab@@ d@@ omen , Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ric Alli@@ one , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old pharmac@@ ist , told the AF@@ P .
Five minutes later , a second person arrived , aged around thirty , with kni@@ fe wo@@ unds .
National police officers were the ones who arrested the man , who was not carrying any identification documents .
The case will be brought to the Nan@@ ter@@ re Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office by the region &apos;s police service for Hau@@ ts@@ -@@ de@@ -S@@ eine ( SD@@ P@@ J 92 ) .
The ma@@ d@@ man was taken to a hospital on Thursday evening .
He had not yet had a chance to speak after being taken into cust@@ ody .
A police source did not exclude the possibility of him being committed to a psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c hospital .
According to another police source , six polic@@ emen were needed to sub@@ due the man at the police station in C@@ lich@@ y , where he was taken .
He was &quot; in a state of hyper@@ exc@@ itement &quot; as are &quot; all cra@@ zed people of this kind , whose strength increases ten@@ fold under its effect &quot; .
USA : Pol@@ an@@ ski &apos;s lawyer calls af@@ res@@ h for proceedings to be dropped
The lawyer of the Fran@@ co-@@ Polish film director , Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski , called again in Los Angeles on Thursday ( California , western United States ) , for the aband@@ onment of proceedings against his client , who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old .
C@@ had Hum@@ mel , the lawyer for the director of &quot; The Pi@@ an@@ ist &quot; c@@ ited grave errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977 , in front of three judges at the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al of California &apos;s second district .
I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now , declared Mr. Hum@@ mel , before adding that the behaviour of the judge , who was dealing with the case at the time , Laur@@ ence R@@ itt@@ en@@ band , &quot; sends ch@@ ills down the sp@@ ine &quot; .
According to him , judge R@@ itt@@ en@@ band -- since dec@@ e@@ ased -- is said to have spoken with one of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , who told him that Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski deser@@ ved prison , before passing sentence -- con@@ stit@@ uting a serious error in procedure .
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary &quot; Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski : wanted and desired &quot; , the words coming straight from the prosec@@ utor in question , David Well@@ s .
However , Mr. Well@@ s had eventually declared that he had &quot; lied &quot; to the author of the documentary at the end of September .
In the event of the court &apos;s refusal to abandon proceedings , Mr. Hum@@ mel called for a trial to be held , which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments .
The Pro@@ sec@@ ution , for its part , has re-@@ it@@ er@@ ated its argument , already formed in the first instance , that no aband@@ onment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski did not present himself in court .
The 7@@ 6-@@ year-old film@@ maker had fl@@ ed the United States before his sentence had been passed for &quot; un@@ lawful sexual relations &quot; with a 13@@ -@@ year-old minor .
He has not set foot in the United States since .
The dep@@ uty prosec@@ utor for Los Angeles County , Ph@@ yl@@ lis As@@ ay@@ ama , therefore declared that Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski &quot; must be present at the hearing &quot; .
For this case , are we trying to send the message , not just to ( Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski ) but also other def@@ end@@ ants , that it is ok to fle@@ e ? asked Mr@@ s. As@@ ay@@ ama .
In her view , the film@@ maker &quot; is asking a favour from the court , while at the same time showing dis@@ regard for its authority &quot; .
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their ver@@ dict -- has also emphasised &quot; that there are other alternatives to fle@@ eing &quot; .
Mr. Hum@@ mel was not the only one to request that proceedings against Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski be abandoned .
The lawyer of Sam@@ an@@ th@@ a Gei@@ mer , the victim , also called once again for an end to the proceedings .
R@@ emin@@ ding that her client can no longer stand to be har@@ ass@@ ed with every res@@ ur@@ facing of the Pol@@ an@@ ski case , she added : &quot; No one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure .
Thir@@ ty two years is enough &quot; .
Roman Pol@@ an@@ ski was arrested on the 26@@ th of September in Switzerland on an American warrant .
After more than two months behind bars , he was put under house arrest at his chal@@ et in G@@ sta@@ ad , pending his possible ex@@ tradition .
Wall Street clos@@ es without momentum , slow@@ ed by a strengthening dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday , in a market tor@@ n between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar : the D@@ ow Jones gained 0.@@ 63 % but the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q dropped 0.@@ 03 % .
According to final closing figures , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage has risen by 6@@ 5.@@ 67 points to 10 4@@ 7@@ 1.@@ 50 points , whereas the N@@ AS@@ DA@@ Q , with a technology predomin@@ ance , fell by 0.@@ 55 point to 2 19@@ 0.@@ 31 points .
The wider Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s 500 has itself advanced by 0.@@ 37 % ( 4.@@ 06 points ) to 1 10@@ 6.@@ 41 points .
Frank@@ ly , the market is very calm , ob@@ serves M@@ ace Blick@@ silver of Mar@@ bl@@ eh@@ ead Asset Management .
It remains within a narrow margin ; trading volumes have become very weak , and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year .
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators , which &quot; have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robu@@ st@@ ness of the economic recovery &quot; , summ@@ ar@@ ised Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s an@@ alyst@@ s .
In the United States , retail sales have increased by 1.3 % in November , for the second month in a row , and far more than predic@@ ted .
Moreover , the confidence of American consumers has clearly bo@@ un@@ ced back in December , to 7@@ 3.@@ 4 against 6@@ 7.@@ 4 the previous month , according to preliminary estimates from Mich@@ ig@@ an University &apos;s index .
The indi@@ ces have , however , been slow@@ ed by a renewed rise of the dollar , to a new two-@@ month high against the Euro , which &quot; puts down@@ ward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation &quot; , explained O@@ wen Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck from Deutsche Bank .
Technology securities have thereby lost some ground .
The bond market has fallen .
Treas@@ ury 10-@@ year bond yiel@@ ds have grown to 3.@@ 5@@ 40 % against 3.@@ 4@@ 82 % on Tuesday evening , and 30-@@ year bond yiel@@ ds are at 4.@@ 4@@ 97 % against 4.@@ 4@@ 92 % the previous evening .
Mis@@ s World pa@@ ge@@ ant once again in South Africa
After a mon@@ th-@@ long tre@@ k across South Africa , the 112 candidates for the title of Mis@@ s World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true : to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television vie@@ wers .
During this grand beauty con@@ greg@@ ation organised for the second consec@@ utive year around Johannesburg , five of them have already land@@ ed their tickets to the semi-@@ final .
Mis@@ s Japan , E@@ ru@@ za S@@ as@@ aki , Per@@ la Bel@@ tr@@ an A@@ co@@ sta of Mexico , Mari@@ at@@ u Kar@@ g@@ bo of Sierra Leone , K@@ ai@@ ane Al@@ dor@@ ino from Gibraltar , and Y@@ an@@ bing M@@ a from Canada have been elected Mis@@ s World Spor@@ ts@@ woman or also Mis@@ s World Top Model during their African stay .
It was a real whi@@ rl@@ wind .
To visit beautiful cities like Port Eli@@ zab@@ eth , Dur@@ ban , and Cape Town is extraordinary .
I saw so many things and I have so much new experience , said Mis@@ s of Sierra Leone .
This competition , which is taking place in South Africa for the nin@@ th time , will be transmitted live on Saturday from Mi@@ dr@@ and , north of Johannesburg , starting at 17 : 00 ( 15 : 00 GM@@ T ) .
I could not have dre@@ amed of a better country to award my cro@@ wn .
The experience was fascinating .
I am pleased to have been able to live it twice , points out Mis@@ s World K@@ sen@@ ia Su@@ k@@ hin@@ ova in the heat of the southern summer .
For the young Russian , her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-@@ discovery &quot; of landscapes in this country that take your bre@@ ath away &quot; .
After a month of gal@@ as , re@@ hear@@ s@@ als , press meetings , and saf@@ aris , the Mis@@ s candidates are concentr@@ ating on the competition .
The Indian P@@ oo@@ ja Ch@@ op@@ ra hopes to follow in the foot@@ steps of Pri@@ y@@ an@@ ka Ch@@ op@@ ra , elected in 2000 and present at this vote , as well as those of A@@ ish@@ war@@ ya R@@ ai in 1994 , both of whom have become stars of B@@ oll@@ ywood .
It is the dream of every woman to be crow@@ ned the most beautiful woman in the world , but it is not all about appearance .
We are amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for our countries and I want to return home with the cro@@ wn , asser@@ ts Mis@@ s India with a broad s@@ mile .
According to organis@@ ers , music and dance will mark this 5@@ 9th edition .
Can@@ di@@ dates will par@@ ade in traditional out@@ fits and , of course , in swi@@ m@@ suits .
The show will be presented by Angela C@@ how , an ethnic Chinese television present@@ er , the South African ex-@@ beauty qu@@ een Mich@@ elle Mc@@ L@@ ean , and an officer from the Mis@@ s World Committee , Steve Dou@@ glas .
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better , affir@@ ms Juli@@ a Mor@@ ley , president of Mis@@ s World .
The candidates went on saf@@ ari , as they did last year , visited the famous t@@ own@@ ship of Sow@@ e@@ to , but this time by bicycle , and sam@@ pled the local cuisine .
Exc@@ ep@@ tionally , they also met the South African president , Jac@@ ob Z@@ uma , who sh@@ ook their hands .
Un@@ usual for a head of State , notes Mis@@ s Sierra Leone .
Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town ( Sou@@ thwest ) for football in June 2010 , a way for the country to promote the event a little more .
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach .
I will without a doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup , enth@@ uses Mis@@ s Italy , Ali@@ ce T@@ ati@@ c@@ chi .
The news about John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day &quot; is very positive &quot; , according to son David
The news about John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day &quot; is very positive &quot; , ass@@ ures his son , David , on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles , where he was to be by his father &apos;s bed@@ side , who has been in hospital for several days .
The news is very positive .
He is very strong , all will go well , declared his son , David Hall@@ y@@ day , to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13 : 00 local time ( 21 : 00 GM@@ T ) .
The singer &apos;s son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading &quot; without delay &quot; to the C@@ ed@@ ar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital in Los Angeles , where John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day was admitted on Monday for an infection st@@ em@@ ming from a sli@@ pped disc operation on November 26@@ th in Paris .
The singer was &quot; put in an artificial com@@ a tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons , to prevent his suffering , and to allow his treatment to be administ@@ ered &quot; , indicated the press service .
John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day had already been put in an artificial com@@ a by doctors at the C@@ ed@@ ar@@ s@@ -S@@ in@@ a@@ ï hospital in Los Angeles , where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection st@@ em@@ ming from a sli@@ pped disc operation on the 26@@ th of November in Paris .
The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant les@@ ions resulting from the operation .
His wife , La@@ e@@ ti@@ cia , went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School , where their daughter J@@ ade is en@@ rolled , to attend a school performance , observed an AF@@ P photographer .
The Head of Or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c and Trau@@ ma Sur@@ gery of the Pi@@ ti@@ é@@ -S@@ alp@@ ê@@ tri@@ ère hospital , Y@@ ves Cat@@ on@@ é , announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday .
The producer veh@@ em@@ ently brought into question Dr. St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x , the neur@@ o-@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , who operated on the singer on the 26@@ th of November at the International Clin@@ ic of Parc Mon@@ ce@@ au in Paris .
They told us it was car@@ n@@ age .
The Los Angeles sur@@ ge@@ ons said they were a@@ gh@@ ast , declared Mr. Cam@@ us .
I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come , he said .
Jean-@@ Claude Cam@@ us reck@@ oned that John@@ ny Hall@@ y@@ day had &quot; left far too soon for Los Angeles , with the Paris sur@@ ge@@ on &apos;s authorisation &quot; .
I had this doctor on the phone in person , and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip , which sho@@ cked me , as I , myself , have had two sli@@ pped disc@@ s , he added .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before , on RT@@ L , he had indicated that the singer apparently &quot; had left without a dra@@ in or anything &quot; , following his Paris operation .
Dr St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x is well-known in artistic circles .
He had operated on the act@@ ress Marie Trin@@ tig@@ n@@ ant in Vil@@ ni@@ us a few days before her death at a clin@@ ic in Neu@@ ill@@ y-@@ sur@@ -S@@ eine , where he practic@@ ed at the time .
In 2007 , he had also operated on the act@@ ress Char@@ l@@ otte G@@ ain@@ s@@ bourg to res@@ or@@ b a ha@@ em@@ atom@@ a , following a cer@@ eb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
However , he is also a doctor with a not@@ orious reputation , convic@@ ted by the Law on several occasions , in cases of medical liability , as well as for fraud and tax ev@@ asion .
Oli@@ vier M@@ etz@@ ner , the lawyer for the Doc@@ tors &apos; governing body , accused him of being &quot; a man without sc@@ ru@@ ples &quot; , who &quot; regularly &quot; has to answer to the governing body &apos;s Council , and who is &quot; far from rep@@ utable &quot; .
After several days of silence , Dr. St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Del@@ aj@@ ou@@ x made an announcement on Friday through his so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , David K@@ oub@@ bi .
The latter indicated that the operation had &quot; gone perfectly well &quot; and that post-@@ operation tests returned &quot; normal &quot; .
The operation &quot; was not ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ g@@ ic and therefore did not required a dra@@ in to be fitted &quot; , he added .
In any case , the singer &apos;s tour , for whom health problems have been multi@@ pl@@ ying since the summer , would seem to be on hold .
Clearly , resum@@ ing the tour on the 8th of January &#91; in A@@ mi@@ ens &#93; as planned seems very soon , declared Mr. Cam@@ us .
The U@@ DF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its ac@@ ron@@ ym
The U@@ DF alliance , controlled by Franç@@ ois Bay@@ rou &apos;s Democratic Mo@@ vement ( Mo@@ Dem ) , re@@ acted on Friday to the bu@@ y-@@ out bid made by the New Centre &apos;s president , Her@@ v@@ é Mor@@ in , for the ac@@ ron@@ ym of the former G@@ is@@ car@@ dian party , by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances , threatening legal action otherwise .
Her@@ v@@ é Mor@@ in announced publicly that he intended to rec@@ ou@@ p the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ ym , ruling that Franç@@ ois Bay@@ rou was not worthy of its political heritage , having extended his hand to the Left .
The Defence Minister , whose party is partner to the UM@@ P , had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the N@@ C &apos;s national Council .
In support of his move , he received backing from dep@@ uty Her@@ v@@ é de Char@@ ette ( ex-@@ UM@@ P swit@@ ched to N@@ C ) , who claims his ownership of the U@@ DF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute .
However , Friday evening , the U@@ DF Alliance &apos;s office , headed by Franç@@ ois Bay@@ rou &apos;s friends , who do not plan to give up possession , has come out of silence to launch an attack against the dep@@ uty , ordering him not to use the ac@@ ron@@ ym , and to transfer the trademark &apos;s ownership to them , otherwise threatening legal action .
In the last few days , you have step@@ ped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to reg@@ ain the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ ym , the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office , including Franç@@ ois Bay@@ rou and Mari@@ elle de Sar@@ nez from the Mo@@ Dem , as well as the sen@@ ator , Jean Ar@@ thu@@ is , from the centre Alliance .
You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website &apos;s homepage the movement &apos;s name , the New Centre , and to follow it with the s@@ logan : today &apos;s U@@ DF , remark those who signed the document .
As you are well aware , you have no right to the use of the ac@@ ron@@ ym , explains the U@@ DF &apos;s office , requiring that the N@@ C remove &quot; immediately any mention of the U@@ DF name from all material , and from ( their ) internet site &quot; .
He also requests that Her@@ v@@ é de Char@@ ette &quot; transfer ownership of the trademark to its ri@@ ghtful owners &quot; .
If you failed to do this , the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of U@@ DF members were respected , war@@ n the document &apos;s sign@@ atories .
In their communication , they specify that the U@@ DF &quot; is a political movement in its own right since 1978 &quot; and points out that Mr. Mor@@ in and his friends had &quot; made their choice &quot; to leave him in 2007 &quot; to create a competing movement , as others had done in 2002 , to establish the UM@@ P &quot; .
The New Centre , according to them , has therefore no right to the use of the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ ym ( Union for French Democracy ) .
They also remind that the U@@ DF &apos;s last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the Mo@@ Dem for three years , and for the creation of an office charged with defending &quot; the material and moral interests &quot; of the body founded by Val@@ é@@ ry G@@ is@@ card d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing .
As for Her@@ v@@ é de Char@@ ette , the office continues , &quot; when he registered the trademark &quot; , he had &quot; not been a U@@ DF member for three years &quot; , but , in fact , with the UM@@ P .
He is prof@@ iting in a sc@@ andal@@ ous and frau@@ dul@@ ent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the U@@ DF ac@@ ron@@ ym by taking it to benefit his own account .
This incident is turning into a major off@@ ence , they state , before adding ir@@ on@@ ically about the N@@ C &apos;s strategy that : &quot; in our opinion , in politics as in real life , it is more dig@@ ni@@ fied to make one &apos;s own name rather than try to become somebody by frau@@ dul@@ ently acqu@@ iring a name we have no right to &quot; .
L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court C@@ ase : Franç@@ o@@ is-@@ Marie B@@ ani@@ er will be tried for &quot; abuse of weakness &quot;
The Nan@@ ter@@ re tri@@ bunal decided on Friday to bring Franç@@ o@@ is-@@ Marie B@@ ani@@ er to trial to as@@ certain whether , as the daughter of billi@@ on@@ ai@@ ress L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court is acc@@ using him , he prof@@ ited from the ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ year-old &apos;s weak@@ ened mental state to des@@ po@@ il her of some of her fortun@@ e .
The photographer , 62 , known for his photographs of the stars , will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for &quot; abuse of weakness &quot; , an off@@ ence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 3@@ 75 000 euro fine .
The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case , which is turning into a worthy family sag@@ a involving one of the rich@@ est families in France , where mother and daughter are tor@@ n apart , while at the re@@ ins of the L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al cosme@@ tics empire .
However , the 15th Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate &apos;s Court has also ordered a combined expert medical opinion of L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court , aged 87 , to be led by three doctors .
The hei@@ ress and principal shar@@ eholder of L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al has always refused to under@@ go such an ex@@ am , at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nan@@ ter@@ re court at the time of the investigation .
The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by the 10th of March , 2010 , stating , in particular , whether L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court could have found herself in a weak@@ ened state and at which times .
I think she will submit to it .
I will talk with her about it , declared Mr@@ s. Bet@@ ten@@ court &apos;s lawyer , Geor@@ ges K@@ ie@@ j@@ man , at the exit of the hearing .
For his part , the lawyer of Franç@@ o@@ ise Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers , Oli@@ vier M@@ etz@@ ner , congrat@@ ulated himself on the court &apos;s decision .
It is excellent news ( … ) The expert opinion will prove that he ( Mr. B@@ ani@@ er ) manipul@@ ated this elderly lady , whom we should be protecting , he affir@@ med .
For two years , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court &apos;s daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against Franç@@ o@@ is-@@ Marie B@@ ani@@ er , the photographer and all-@@ round artist , whom she acc@@ uses of prof@@ iting for years from her mother &apos;s weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations , in the form of ch@@ equ@@ es , life insurance contracts , or works of art .
As far as she is concerned , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court has always re@@ fut@@ ed having been manipul@@ ated by the photographer , who she considers a long-@@ standing friend .
As the court on Friday was due to examine the ad@@ mis@@ sibility of the case brought by Mr@@ s. Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers , the ple@@ as from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an un@@ vei@@ ling of intimate family matters .
Thus , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court &apos;s lawyer c@@ ited three letters sent by his client ( in 1999 , 2003 , and 2005 ) to her so@@ lic@@ it@@ or , in which she expressed having susp@@ ici@@ ons about Franç@@ o@@ ise Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers &apos; husband .
In the letter dated from 2003 , L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court added , according to the lawyer : &quot; could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. B@@ ani@@ er once or twice a day for fifteen years . &quot;
I have been unable to speak to Franç@@ o@@ ise since her marriage &quot; .
For its part , the Court in Nan@@ ter@@ re has again ruled that the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s claim was not ad@@ missible for action , all the more so after a judge super@@ vising guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship refused her request in the past few days to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother .
L@@ ili@@ ane Bet@@ ten@@ court &quot; is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings , she is not under protection and does not have a guar@@ dian .
Nob@@ ody needs to act on her behalf &quot; , affir@@ ms the Public Pro@@ sec@@ ution &apos;s representative , Mari@@ e-@@ Christ@@ ine Dau@@ big@@ ney .
The Court determined that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the ad@@ mis@@ sibility of Mr@@ s. Bet@@ ten@@ cour@@ t-@@ Me@@ yers &apos;s claim had taken place .
A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence ?
If nothing changes in the way France &apos;s biggest enterprises are run , our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in v@@ ain …
For over ten years , the Management &apos;s attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution : employees should be made to adhere to &quot; values &quot; dict@@ ated from above just as it was in the past , when products dre@@ amed up by the factory &apos;s engineers were dropped on the consumer .
By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation , the marketing revolution put the strategies for con@@ qu@@ ering markets the right way up again ... even if authoritarian temp@@ tation to impose products , which are dis@@ connected from the preferences of the consumer tend to res@@ ur@@ face regularly !
A demo@@ bili@@ sation of employees can lead to terminal dem@@ or@@ alisation .
Su@@ ici@@ des at France Telec@@ om , PS@@ A and Ren@@ ault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular .
Dem@@ o@@ bili@@ sation gra@@ vely compromises the development of an organisation &apos;s strategic functions , notably in R &amp; D , but even more so in competitive intelligence .
Indeed , C@@ I &quot; demands from all sides concerned ( ... ) a pro@@ active approach and a long-term vision &quot; ; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradic@@ ted by authoritarian management methods .
For this reason , we are calling for a management revolution , which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise &apos;s concerns alongside consumers .
The very relative us@@ eful@@ ness of internal opinion surve@@ ys
Will internal opinion surve@@ ys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in man@@ ag@@ erial methods ?
Unfortunately , I fear it will not .
- Firstly , because I have witnessed that , when faced with a new situation , any organisation will arrive , after many det@@ ours , at doing chi@@ ef@@ ly ... what it always does !
- Next , because authorit@@ ari@@ anism - a disease of power - grows propor@@ tionally with the magn@@ it@@ ude of its own failures .
- Finally , because most leaders have a simpli@@ stic view of human behaviour .
Com@@ ing from the top technical educational establishments , they have a mechan@@ istic interpretation of psych@@ ology .
They adopt , for intellectual convenience , the old behavi@@ our@@ ist theory , which has recently been re-@@ aw@@ ak@@ ened by the &quot; neur@@ o-@@ sciences &quot; of the United States that have been widely and sil@@ ently diff@@ used by business institutes and the Media .
In this way , by suggest@@ ing that &quot; le@@ vers &quot; &#91; si@@ c &#93; can be pul@@ led for the commitment of management staff , a recent I@@ p@@ sos survey published on Fig@@ aro@@ .@@ fr cra@@ d@@ les leaders into a position of mechan@@ istic governance , which is un@@ suited to the world of today .
Identi@@ fy and quanti@@ fy mobili@@ sation factors
In contrast , the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises sup@@ poses the adoption of a fin@@ alistic vision of human behaviour .
It consists in the integration , within all management strategies and practices , of a fundamental admission : for employees , commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realis@@ ing a part of their dreams , their ambitions , and their plans .
Currently , only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation .
These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-@@ determined consensus of opinion , which allows them , by means of this perceived view , to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans .
By identifying and gau@@ ging these mobili@@ sation factors , enterprise leaders can control , predic@@ t and anticip@@ ate their &quot; social performance &quot; and turn their management of resources &quot; the right way round &quot; .
They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concer@@ ted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence .
Oslo speech : the &quot; just war &quot; ear@@ ns Obama praise from the Right
The American Right paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in Oslo by Barack Obama , satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of a &quot; just war &quot; against the enemies of the United States .
The conserv@@ atives , who had mo@@ cked the awar@@ ding of the Prize to Obama on October 9th , were this time giving the presidential speech their appl@@ ause , lead by Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in , former vic@@ e-@@ president candidate during the 2008 elections .
I liked what he said , declared Mr@@ s. Pal@@ in , right-@@ wing champion of the Republic@@ an party , to the daily newspaper USA Today , adding that she had herself touched on the topic of war that is &quot; sometimes necessary &quot; in her mem@@ o@@ irs , which have just been published .
War is , of course , one of the last things , which Americans want to get involved in , but it is necessary .
We must stop these terrorists over there , she affir@@ med .
Mr. Obama , who has inher@@ ited the two wars from his predecessor , George W. Bush , in Iraq and Afghanistan , applied himself on Thursday in Oslo to justi@@ fying res@@ or@@ ting to force , a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier .
Another one of Mr. Obama &apos;s opponents , New@@ t G@@ ing@@ rich , concluded that the president had done &quot; very good work &quot; in Oslo .
I found his speech to be really very good , approved the former Spe@@ aker in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , who had particularly valued the mention that &quot; E@@ vi@@ l does exist in the world &quot; in the presidential dis@@ course .
From certain view@@ points , I found this speech to be of historic significance , declared Mr. G@@ ing@@ rich , during an interview for the radio show &quot; The Tak@@ e@@ away &quot; .
The former representative , considered by some a possible candidate for the Republic@@ an inau@@ gur@@ ation of the 2012 presidential elections , was delighted to see &quot; a president from the Left &quot; remind the Nob@@ le Committee members &quot; that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if res@@ or@@ ting to force had not been an option &quot; .
For Michael Ger@@ son , a former writer for George W. Bush and re-@@ converted colum@@ n@@ ist for the Washington Post , Mr. Obama has given &quot; a very American speech &quot; .
As well as presenting himself as a &quot; world citizen &quot; , as &quot; he always does &quot; , &quot; he spoke like an American President &quot; , remin@@ ding Europeans &quot; that they live in a security bub@@ ble , which they did not create and they are doing little to preserve &quot; , declared Mr. Ger@@ son .
Among the few un@@ convinced right-@@ wing@@ ers , a ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish character from the Bush era , the former UN amb@@ ass@@ ador , John Bol@@ ton , described the speech as &quot; dr@@ ab , tur@@ gi@@ d , and un@@ inspired &quot; on the National Review Online &apos;s website .
To the president &apos;s left , the democratic representative D@@ ennis Ku@@ cin@@ ich was al@@ armed to see Barack Obama justify res@@ or@@ ting to force .
When we wra@@ p war inside the notion of justice , the mass@@ ac@@ re of innocent people can easily be justified , he warned .
Cent@@ re-@@ left Press nevertheless remained full of praise for the president .
The Los Angeles Times , still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize had been pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely awarded to Mr. Obama , described his address as &quot; a block@@ bu@@ ster &quot; , even for a speaker that is known for his talent .
The Oslo speech &quot; should serve as a road@@ map for guiding international decisions made on conflicts , poverty and op@@ pression &quot; , enth@@ used the Califor@@ ni@@ an newspaper .
Mr. Obama &quot; made the speech that was needed &quot; , reports the New York Times , jud@@ ging it &quot; both som@@ bre and edi@@ fying &quot; .
Road freight : three mar@@ ath@@ ons for one agreement to save Christmas deliveries
Following three mar@@ athon sessions of negotiations , transport unions and the T@@ L@@ F , the only employ@@ er &apos;s organisation to have remained to the end , reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries .
During the signing on Friday evening , Transport Secretary Domini@@ que Bus@@ ser@@ eau was &quot; delighted &quot; with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning .
After a second night of discussions , negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swi@@ ft signing of the agreement &apos;s text later in the morning .
And this , despite three employers &apos; organisations ( F@@ NT@@ R , UN@@ O@@ ST@@ RA , OT@@ RE ) having sl@@ amm@@ ed the door .
However , it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11@@ am for everyone to be in agreement , and for the text to be signed at 6@@ pm .
The dis@@ agreement &quot; would have been very damaging for the companies &quot; and &quot; it looked like it might threaten the end of year fes@@ tivities &quot; , Mr. Bus@@ ser@@ eau stated .
The document allows for a 4 % increase in salaries for the lowest ones ( in local and regional road transport ) , and a 2.@@ 9 % increase for higher ones ( international transport ) .
H@@ our@@ ly rates , for those on lower pay , &quot; go from 8.@@ 72 euros to 9.@@ 06 .
It is not much , but we have come a long way , explains Patri@@ ce C@@ los ( Wor@@ ker &apos;s Union ) .
This evening we will give the order to our campaign@@ ers not to form block@@ ades or pick@@ et at delivery de@@ pots .
There may , however , always be a few difficult ones , who remain un@@ cooperative , he added .
Phili@@ ppe Gri@@ l@@ lot , president of the T@@ L@@ F , paid tribute to &quot; a good agreement &quot; , even if it was &quot; difficult to conc@@ ede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition &quot; .
According to him , the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones .
It is a common sense agreement , respecting the workers , declared Maxim@@ e D@@ um@@ ont ( CF@@ D@@ T ) , while Th@@ ier@@ ry Dou@@ ine ( C@@ FT@@ C ) pra@@ ised it as &quot; a historic agreement &quot; .
As for Richard J@@ auber@@ t ( C@@ G@@ T ) , he described it as &quot; an acceptable compromise &quot; .
The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3 % and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010 , which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month &apos;s pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement .
Mr. Bus@@ ser@@ eau reminded everyone that &quot; a 100 million euro cut in employers &apos; charges &quot; had been the subject of a Government amendment in correc@@ tive financial legislation for 2009 , voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly .
The Government will ask that the Sen@@ ate vote on it &quot; in the same tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame &quot; .
The signature from the T@@ L@@ F allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation , and secondly , to the whole profession , subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour .
It will be done &quot; in a very short time &quot; , ass@@ ures Mr. Bus@@ ser@@ eau .
The opposing employers &apos; organisations can only delay the process .
The F@@ NT@@ R called it a &quot; sha@@ m &quot; , because the 100 million euros &quot; had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax &quot; .
The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table , not with the aim of a two-@@ si@@ ded review , but to avoid up@@ setting the tur@@ ke@@ y-@@ e@@ aters this Christmas , depl@@ ores the UN@@ O@@ ST@@ RA .
For the OT@@ RE , the agreement risks &quot; dig@@ ging the gra@@ ves of a large number of the sector &apos;s SMEs over the next 12 months &quot; .
R@@ ER A : dis@@ rup@@ tions this weekend , unions un@@ happy with R@@ AT@@ P proposals
Dis@@ rup@@ tions on the R@@ ER A , the largest urban public transport link in France , are set to continue over the weekend , as a meeting on Friday , the second day of strikes , between the unions and the R@@ AT@@ P management have left their pay demands un@@ met .
Saturday and Sunday , on this critical weekend of shopping before Christmas , trains will only run between the hours of 10@@ am and 8@@ pm , with just one out of two trains running on the central stretch ( between La Dé@@ f@@ ense and Nation ) , and one out of four outside the central section .
The operation of the inter@@ change with the S@@ NC@@ F will be suspended at Nan@@ ter@@ re Pr@@ é@@ f@@ ecture , forcing passengers to change trains .
The Gal@@ eries L@@ af@@ ay@@ ette , who welcome 200 000 customers every day , were delighted by the fact that &quot; the R@@ AT@@ P is making efforts to assist the department stores &quot; .
The R@@ ER A runs through the Par@@ isi@@ an con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation from West to East .
The R@@ AT@@ P segment runs from Saint-@@ Ger@@ main@@ -@@ en-@@ Lay@@ e and Nan@@ ter@@ re to Bo@@ is@@ sy@@ -S@@ a@@ int-@@ L@@ é@@ ger and Mar@@ ne-@@ L@@ a-@@ Vall@@ ée .
On Friday , approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times , with almost no trains at all during off-@@ peak periods , as planned .
As on Thursday , there was no trouble with crow@@ ds on the platforms , as Par@@ isi@@ ans had gotten themselves organised .
Thus , in the early hours , the station at Saint-@@ Ger@@ main@@ -@@ en-@@ Lay@@ e ( Y@@ vel@@ ines ) was far less busy than usual , notably because of the absence of school and college students .
At Bo@@ is@@ sy@@ -S@@ a@@ int-@@ L@@ é@@ ger ( V@@ al-@@ de-@@ Mar@@ ne ) , Jack N@@ bak@@ ina , a 29@@ -@@ year-old engineer , explained that he had gotten up &quot; an hour and a half earlier , to be sure of arriving on time &quot; .
The Saint-@@ L@@ az@@ are station did not see any over@@ crow@@ ding , the S@@ NC@@ F stated , having planned for additional support staff and police officers .
The R@@ ER A trains operated by the S@@ NC@@ F to or from C@@ erg@@ y-@@ L@@ e-@@ Haut were depar@@ ting or arriving from Saint-@@ L@@ az@@ are station , where they link with the metro .
New general meetings for stri@@ kers will be held on Saturday and Sunday , which will review the results , seen as &quot; poor &quot; by the unions , of a meeting with Management held on Friday afternoon .
The R@@ ER &apos;s director proposes to negotiate a specific agreement for the R@@ ER A on all aspects , working hours , career paths , etc …
It is not what the drivers , who are demanding the bonus they are owed , want , according to Th@@ ier@@ ry Gar@@ on ( SU@@ D ) .
The R@@ AT@@ P has even put its offer of bon@@ uses on hold , the C@@ G@@ T compl@@ ained , pointing out that the management &quot; could not be bo@@ ther@@ ed to resolve the problem , whereas road transport and the S@@ NC@@ F both have it done and du@@ sted &quot; .
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for &quot; a wider review of the conditions of practice for the profession &quot; , the R@@ AT@@ P elabor@@ ated .
Pro@@ mp@@ ting the unions to remark further that the company &quot; did not care about its weekend passengers &quot; .
During the morning , some 150 drivers inv@@ aded a works council meeting at the company &apos;s seat in Paris .
That is when Management , which had until then refused to enter into any discussions during the strike , had suggested the meeting &quot; in a motion to calm the situation &quot; .
The dispute is threatening to extend to R@@ ER B on Tuesday , following the submission of an advance notice by the UN@@ SA and the In@@ dé@@ p@@ end@@ ants groups .
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros ( UN@@ SA ) to 150 euros , with a 30-@@ euro variable band ( C@@ G@@ T , F@@ O , CF@@ D@@ T , SU@@ D , In@@ dé@@ p@@ end@@ ants ) and are compl@@ aining of the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day .
The R@@ ER drivers , all in the later stages of their care@@ ers , are paid a gross sal@@ ary of 2@@ 200 to 27@@ 00 euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonus pay for split shi@@ fts , Sun@@ days and holidays .
Turkish justice b@@ ans the pro-@@ Kur@@ d party , a decision laden with consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a ver@@ dict on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the country &apos;s main pro-@@ Kur@@ d party , a decision which was immediately followed by an@@ gr@@ y protests within the Kurdish community in the Sou@@ theast of the country and in Istanbul .
The decision is likely to greatly complic@@ ate the Government &apos;s work , as it has just recently made positive gest@@ ures towards the Kurdish community in an attempt to resolve a 25-@@ year old conflict .
The Party for a Democratic Society ( D@@ TP ) was dis@@ b@@ anded because it had become &quot; a hot@@ bed of damaging activities against the State &apos;s independence and its un@@ failing unity &quot; , the President of the Court , H@@ asi@@ m K@@ ili@@ ç , declared to the press at the end of four days of deliber@@ ations .
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges , while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the dis@@ b@@ anding , Mr. K@@ ili@@ ç indicated , adding that 37 of the party &apos;s representatives , including its president , Ah@@ met Tür@@ k , and the dep@@ uty , Ay@@ sel Tu@@ glu@@ k , have been ban@@ ished from political life for the next five years .
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity , from which both Mr. Tür@@ k and Mr@@ s. Tu@@ glu@@ k benef@@ ited , and the conf@@ isc@@ ation of party assets by the Treas@@ ury .
The D@@ TP occup@@ ies 21 seats in Parliament ( out of 5@@ 50 ) .
Its leaders had warned prior to the ver@@ dict that the representatives would leave Parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affili@@ ation .
The decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosec@@ utor of the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court , Ab@@ dur@@ rah@@ man Y@@ al@@ ç@@ ink@@ aya , who acc@@ uses the D@@ TP of o@@ be@@ ying &quot; directives &quot; from the Kur@@ dist@@ an Wor@@ kers &apos; Party ( PK@@ K ) , which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and in many countries .
Many observers believe the D@@ TP serves as a legal political shop window for the PK@@ K re@@ bels .
The party maintains , however , that it has &quot; no organic links &quot; with the PK@@ K , but ref@@ uses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it .
The court &apos;s ver@@ dict comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures , rein@@ forcing its rights in an attempt to qu@@ ash Kurdish support for the PK@@ K and put an end to the conflict .
D@@ TP leaders had stated that a dis@@ solution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the An@@ at@@ oli@@ an Sou@@ theast , where a great number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PK@@ K &apos;s head , Ab@@ dul@@ l@@ ah Ö@@ cal@@ an , have de@@ generated into c@@ las@@ hes with police in the last few weeks .
As soon as the Law made its announcement , a thousand protes@@ ters gathered before the D@@ TP &apos;s buildings in Di@@ yar@@ bak@@ ir , the Sou@@ theast &apos;s main city , populated mainly by Kur@@ ds .
Police forces fi@@ red t@@ ear@@ -@@ gas gr@@ en@@ ades and used water c@@ ann@@ ons , as demonstr@@ ators thre@@ w Mol@@ ot@@ ov cocktails and stones with sl@@ ings .
Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul .
Following the ver@@ dict , Mr. Tür@@ k declared that the Law &apos;s decision would &quot; deep@@ en the des@@ pair &quot; .
Turkey cannot resolve this &#91; Kurdish &#93; issue by bann@@ ing a party , he told the Press .
The Government , a party rooted in Islamic influences , also condemned the decision .
We are opposed on principle to the closing down of parties .
It does not solve anything , declared the Energy Minister , T@@ aner Y@@ il@@ di@@ z .
This decision puts a b@@ low@@ tor@@ ch to the Government &apos;s democratic olive branch , comments political analy@@ st Ah@@ met Insel .
Of course , we can expect a reaction from the PK@@ K , he added .
On Thursday , the PK@@ K claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the North of Turkey three days earlier , one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t in the last few months .
The snow can come
A really hard , fro@@ sty winter , that is what Wolfgang Brau@@ burger is wishing for .
Not because he wants to make a lau@@ gh@@ ing stock of people , says the the head of the F@@ ES winter road maintenance service .
But so that his employees can try out and learn every fac@@ it of their vehicle &apos;s technology .
This may be the case for the first time this weekend , according to met@@ e@@ or@@ ologists .
More than 3@@ 30 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice .
Here , the F@@ ES is proceed@@ ing according to a precise plan .
As soon as Frankfurt is blan@@ k@@ eted in snow and the temperatures drop below zero , 20 so-called &quot; A Rou@@ tes &quot; are servi@@ ced by large-scale distribution vehicles , explains Brau@@ burger .
These include , for instance , main traffic roads and through roads , such as Neue Weg and Han@@ auer Land@@ strasse .
But also fire roads , public transport routes , pedestrian zones and roads with slopes , such as A@@ tz@@ el@@ berg@@ strasse .
The service of the F@@ ES starts at three in the morning
The approx . 1,@@ 0@@ 40 km would , if necessary , have to be gr@@ itted with wet salt , which has better adhes@@ ive properties , within no more than three hours .
That is why the F@@ ES start at three in the morning , &quot; so the routes are free by the time comm@@ uter traffic starts &quot; .
It becomes difficult when it only begins snow@@ ing at 7.@@ 30 am .
Then we are faced with a problem , says the head of the winter road service , &quot; because nobody is prepared to make way for the gr@@ itting vehicles &quot; .
Only then , unless it continues to snow , is it the turn of approach and connecting roads , which also include Rat@@ -@@ Bei@@ l-@@ Strasse .
The last priority are quiet side and minor roads .
That is where complaints are made , knows Brau@@ burger .
At five in the morning , the foot@@ men of the F@@ ES set to work , and dangerous areas and pass@@ ages are clear@@ ed .
The F@@ ES can usually not attend to all bike routes .
There is a special service in Frankfurt , which keeps an eye on the bridges , in particular from 10 pm until 4.@@ 30 am , says Brau@@ burger .
As sli@@ p@@ per@@ y ice quickly forms on them , the gr@@ it@@ ter sets off as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees cen@@ tig@@ ra@@ de .
Where required , it is also called out by the police .
The cra@@ dle of the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs
Ta@@ wa Hall@@ ae looked like many other car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs : The animal , standing two metres t@@ all and with a length of 1.@@ 50 metres on two strong h@@ ind legs , had a long@@ ish sk@@ ull with sharp , cur@@ ved teeth , short arms with si@@ ck@@ le-@@ shaped cla@@ ws and a long tail .
If the species had lived a couple of million years later , it would not be anything special .
But Ta@@ wa Hall@@ ae was one of the first din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs with such physical features , reports Ster@@ ling N@@ es@@ bit@@ t and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Aus@@ tin in Science magazine of Thursday .
The animal lived about 2@@ 15 million years in what is today New Mexico , which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent P@@ ang@@ a@@ ea at the equ@@ ator .
Ta@@ wa opens a new window to the early evolution of din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs , says N@@ es@@ bit@@ t .
It reveals a great deal about the relationships , the spread , and the features of early din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs .
In 2006 N@@ es@@ bit@@ t and the other pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ologists started an excav@@ ation on the G@@ host Ran@@ ch in northern New Mexico .
&quot; On some days we found do@@ zen din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur b@@ ones , that is exemplary for se@@ di@@ ments from the Tri@@ assi@@ c period , &quot; reports team member Rand@@ all Ir@@ m@@ is of the U@@ t@@ ah Museum of Natural History .
The scientists identified some b@@ ones quickly .
During the excav@@ ations , they collected the remains of a total of five creatures .
Find confirms the@@ ories on early din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur history
The name Ta@@ wa comes from the sun go@@ d of the Hop@@ i Indi@@ ans .
For Ster@@ ling N@@ es@@ bit@@ t , it is an exceptional find : &quot; D@@ ino@@ sa@@ ur fossi@@ ls from the Tri@@ assi@@ c period are extremely rare . Mo@@ stly , only individual frag@@ ments are found . &quot;
Other din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur researchers do not quite share this enthusiasm .
&quot; This find is not particularly spectacular , but it does confirm some the@@ ories on the early history of din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs . &quot; says Martin S@@ ander of the University of Bonn , for instance .
According to current doctr@@ ine , the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago .
But many of the oldest fossi@@ ls are incomplete , for which reason the classification of these pri@@ mal din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs is highly con@@ ten@@ tious .
As such , the experts debated , for instance , when the sa@@ uri@@ ans split into the three most important lines of development : the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , which later included Ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sa@@ ur@@ us re@@ x , the Vel@@ o@@ ci@@ rap@@ tor and birds , the four-@@ leg@@ ged sa@@ urop@@ o@@ ds known as the &quot; long nec@@ ks &quot; and their relatives , and the pl@@ ant-@@ eating Or@@ ni@@ th@@ isch@@ i@@ ae ( bir@@ d-@@ hi@@ pped sa@@ uri@@ ans ) , which included , for instance , the Tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops and St@@ eg@@ o@@ sa@@ ur@@ us species .
According the analysis of N@@ es@@ bit@@ t and his colleagues , Ta@@ wa Hall@@ ae is a pri@@ mal ther@@ op@@ od .
It has an interesting combination of pri@@ mi@@ tive and progressive properties , says N@@ es@@ bit@@ t .
On the sk@@ ull of Ta@@ wa Hall@@ ae , for instance , the scientists found indications of air bags , as the desc@@ end@@ ants of the ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , birds , have .
Thanks to the air bags , the brea@@ thing of birds is more efficient than that of m@@ amm@@ als .
Ta@@ wa Hall@@ ae &apos;s b@@ ones of the sp@@ ine were obviously also partly filled with air .
Ta@@ wa is the oldest and most pri@@ mi@@ tive ther@@ op@@ od with air bags , says Rand@@ all Ir@@ m@@ is .
As the related line of the huge sa@@ urop@@ o@@ ds later also had air bags and light@@ weight b@@ ones , the joint ancest@@ or of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation .
At least three migration waves to North America
As the most pri@@ mi@@ tive din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs known to date lived in South America , the scientists come to the conclusion that the sa@@ uri@@ ans appeared there first .
Accordingly , the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet , which still formed a single land mass as the super continent P@@ ang@@ a@@ ea .
This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Ta@@ wa Hall@@ ae .
The three cannot possibly desc@@ end from a common ancest@@ or . So they must have migr@@ ated there , is the scientists argument .
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America , says Alan Tur@@ ner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , a co-@@ author of the Science study .
But there are of course contradic@@ tions .
An older species , Sil@@ es@@ aur@@ us , which belongs to a sister group of the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs , lived in what is today Poland , says the B@@ onn@@ -based pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ologist Martin S@@ ander .
He believes that a distor@@ ted picture may emerge simply because a high number of pri@@ mi@@ tive din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur fossi@@ ls have survi@@ ved over the years , while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents .
How din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs managed to develop from a relatively rare side@@ arm of the rep@@ tile tree to become the ruling t@@ et@@ ra@@ po@@ d ver@@ teb@@ rate of the Mes@@ o@@ zo@@ ic , is still anybody &apos;s gu@@ ess .
During the Tri@@ assi@@ c period , the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs still shared their habit@@ at with a large amount of other rep@@ tiles , for instance with the ancest@@ ors of today &apos;s cro@@ codi@@ le and p@@ ter@@ o@@ sa@@ urs and with numerous other sa@@ uri@@ ans .
T@@ ow@@ ards the end of the Tri@@ assi@@ c period , the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs spread across the globe and developed many new species , while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Tri@@ assi@@ c to the Jur@@ assi@@ c periods .
Su@@ cc@@ ess story did not last for ever
There are two the@@ ories to explain this switch , says Martin S@@ ander .
There may have been a case of mass dying , which the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs rand@@ om@@ ly survi@@ ved but not the other rep@@ tiles .
Or the din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs were better adjusted , meaning that they were able to beat off the competition .
In any event , the success story did not last for ever .
150 million years later , a met@@ e@@ or@@ ite impact helped a group of animals , which had also developed back in the Tri@@ assi@@ c period and since lived in the shad@@ ows to b@@ los@@ som : the m@@ amm@@ als .
Solidarity from Vienna to Sa@@ o Paulo
The list is long and the sign@@ atories international .
Prof@@ essors of Tor@@ onto University are on it , as are those from the University of Cambridge , the University of Vienna and Ber@@ kel@@ ey in California .
L@@ ec@@ tur@@ ers from Naples are included , from Qu@@ eb@@ ec , Edinburgh , New York , Sa@@ o Paulo , Berlin or Bremen .
The vacation by the police of the Casino of the Frankfurt Go@@ e@@ the University is having repercussions throughout the world .
27@@ 8 prof@@ essors and teaching assist@@ ants of the Go@@ e@@ the University , but also of coll@@ eg@@ es from all over Germany , Europe and North and South America are showing their solidarity with the prot@@ esting students on the West@@ end camp@@ us .
In a statement written in both German and English , they &quot; condemn &quot; the police action initiated by the executive committee .
University president Werner Müll@@ er-@@ Est@@ ler had the building sei@@ zed by students and assi@@ stant prof@@ essors on strike last week , because walls and objects of art had been bes@@ mir@@ ched .
Five students were h@@ urt in the action .
The material damage , the sign@@ atories argue , does not justify &quot; the for@@ ceful dis@@ solution of self-@@ organised courses of students and lec@@ tur@@ ers by a police comm@@ ando unit &quot; .
The vacation represents &quot; an in@@ acceptable infringement &quot; on the freedom of research and teaching .
The exclusive focus on v@@ and@@ alism serves &quot; to deli@@ gi@@ tim@@ ise and crimin@@ alise the protest &quot; and di@@ stra@@ cts from the matter .
The executive committee has refused to enter into the necessary dis@@ course .
The teaching staff demand the immediate termination of the criminal prosec@@ ution .
The majority of the occup@@ i@@ ers did not support the damage to property , read the statement .
Pro@@ test legitim@@ ised
The youth ranks of the Ver@@ di Union and the German Association of Uni@@ ons are also showing their solidarity with the students .
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for their own future , says Ver@@ di State Youth Secretary Alexander Kl@@ ein .
H@@ esse &apos;s Science Minister E@@ va Küh@@ ne-@@ Hör@@ mann ( CD@@ U ) , however , supported the approach of the university president and police .
We are grateful to the university president .
Dest@@ ru@@ ction and occupation are absolutely in@@ acceptable means , the said in a topical session on Thursday in the Wies@@ baden parliament .
We have sympathy for the protest , but cannot accept v@@ and@@ alism , said the CD@@ U parliament member Peter B@@ eu@@ th .
A different stance was taken by the opposition parties - the SP@@ D , Greens and Left Party .
The CD@@ U is taking bes@@ mir@@ ched walls as the pretext to crimin@@ alise the protest , said Jan@@ ine Wiss@@ ler ( Left Party ) .
Instead of taking the students &apos; arguments and students seriously , they organised this vacation .
The Left Party has filed an application calling on the Minister of Internal Affairs to report on the police action .
A new Si@@ lic@@ on Valley
For many years , it was a secret city , in@@ accessible to Wes@@ tern@@ ers .
Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d , one of ten districts in the capital Moscow , was a highly guar@@ ded location for secret arms research during the Soviet Union .
Nowadays , the municipality with its 2@@ 16@@ ,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia &apos;s Si@@ lic@@ on Valley .
Import@@ ant research and production facilities for mic@@ ro and n@@ ano technology are located here .
In September 2008 , representatives of Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Ri@@ ed@@ berg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre ( F@@ I@@ Z ) .
There were several visits , and on Wednesday Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d and Ri@@ ed@@ berg finally signed a &quot; protocol for closer cooperation &quot; in Frankfurt on Wednesday .
The Moscow Dep@@ uty Mayor , Y@@ ur@@ i Ros@@ ly@@ ak , and P@@ ref@@ ect An@@ at@@ oly S@@ mir@@ no@@ v of Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Ed@@ win Schwar@@ z signed on behalf of Frankfurt .
In 2010 representatives of the F@@ I@@ Z and small@@ - and medium-sized companies focusing on research in natural science will travel to Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d for a seminar .
Scientific exchange
The idea is to establish continuous scientific exchange .
But business relations are also being ey@@ ed .
Companies of the F@@ I@@ Z will have the option to get a foo@@ th@@ old in the growing Russian market .
In turn , Russian businesses want to win orders in Germany .
Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies .
These include , for instance , the Moscow Institute of Elec@@ tro@@ physi@@ cs , and major companies such as Sit@@ ron@@ ics and Ro@@ ssi@@ y@@ sk@@ aya Elektron@@ ika .
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called &quot; socialist planned city &quot; for arms research .
Z@@ el@@ en@@ ogra@@ d ( verb@@ ati@@ m &quot; green city &quot; ) got its name from the woo@@ ded hills where the research facilities are located .
A Stuttgart bra@@ ke block
The impact and dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be over@@ estimated .
For its supporters , the project deals no less than with the &quot; new heart of Europe &quot; .
Quite rightly so . S@@ 21 is far more than lower@@ ing a railway station , more than a gigan@@ tic construction project , which will pl@@ unge the city of the Bad@@ en-@@ Wür@@ tt@@ emberg state capital into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade .
Stuttgart 21 war@@ n born out of the spirit of the 1980s .
Termin@@ us stations with ra@@ ils ending in the middle of towns were regarded as fossi@@ ls of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology , which acted like bra@@ ke blocks to contemporary rail traffic , as it used to take an aw@@ ful lot of time to shift engines from back to front .
P@@ ull in , stop briefly , pull out - that &apos;s the plan .
And therefore , termin@@ us stations were supposed to disappear : as in Frankfurt and Munich .
And in Stuttgart : a non-@@ termin@@ us station , which is approximately half way along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest / B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va - hence the s@@ logan of the &quot; heart of Europe &quot; .
S@@ 21 is actually being built now , although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the reality for years .
Even very ambitious plann@@ ers have recognised that it is virtually un@@ pay@@ able to lower the stations in the capit@@ als of H@@ esse and Bavaria .
Termin@@ us stations also no longer have pul@@ ling in and out problems since the development of pus@@ h-@@ pull trains with railway trac@@ tion units and control cab@@ s at either end .
And still : Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ul@@ m is now being started .
State and municipal politicians have enforced it .
German Rail is participating , also because the risks of the Republic &apos;s biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpay@@ er and not the state company .
As regards urban development , the development can be more or less justified .
An urban area is being created which , if the plann@@ ers &apos; computer@@ -@@ generated graphics are to be believed , will feature a lot of green .
For the rail traffic system , S@@ 21 is damaging .
The non-@@ termin@@ us railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transportation , which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth .
At the time , there was no competition from no-@@ fri@@ ll@@ s airlines .
Con@@ temporary traffic policy , however , should be priori@@ ti@@ sing the handling of freight transportation , as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lor@@ ry on the road .
But the line to be built is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes .
More seriously , S@@ 21 also affects many other rail projects .
A good six billion euros are to be bur@@ ied in the Sw@@ ab@@ ian land .
That is the official figure .
Exper@@ ts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic .
One thing is for sure , the money will be missing at other no@@ des and bott@@ len@@ ecks in the network over the next decade .
A total of six@@ ty major projects are on the list of the transport mini@@ stry .
One of the most important ones is to expand the some 180 km of the line through the Rhine valley .
Work has been continuing on the line in slow motion since 1987 .
It is urgent to really put the foot down here .
But S@@ 21 will act as a bra@@ ke block .
The Rhine valley line will become a bott@@ len@@ eck for international freight transportation : right in the heart of Europe .
Government re@@ viewing ver@@ dict on airport
The state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the ver@@ dict of H@@ esse &apos;s Administr@@ ative Court ( V@@ G@@ H ) to ban night flights .
The CD@@ U / F@@ DP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400 + -@@ page V@@ G@@ H ver@@ dict , said economics minister Di@@ eter Po@@ sch ( F@@ DP ) .
The V@@ G@@ H in Kass@@ el recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to re@@ organise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned nor@@ thwest run@@ way at Frankfurt Airport .
According to the ver@@ dict , the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am , as planned by the state government , is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law .
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the ver@@ dict .
The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administr@@ ative Court in Leipzig .
SP@@ D party leader Tor@@ sten Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ mb@@ el demanded the CD@@ U and F@@ DP to return to their promises to ban night flights , which they made before the election . Otherwise , this would have to be rated as the &quot; breaking of a promise &quot; .
It is bloo@@ dy difficult when you are allowed to keep one &apos;s word , said Greens leader T@@ are@@ k Al-@@ W@@ azi@@ r , all@@ u@@ ding to the F@@ DP election s@@ logan &quot; We keep our word &quot; .
Minister Po@@ sch rejected the accus@@ ation from Sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ Gü@@ mb@@ el that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by &quot; sk@@ e@@ wing justice and playing tri@@ cks &quot; .
A detailed legal examination would take time .
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of &quot; a brief first impression &quot; .
We need a legally compli@@ ant decision , said Stefan Müller ( F@@ DP ) .
As presented by the opposition , his party never made any statements regarding the ban on night flights .
US banks rep@@ ay state support
The cris@@ is-@@ hit US major banks are breaking free from their state sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es .
On Wednesday Bank of America re@@ paid the support from the bank protection fund T@@ AR@@ P in the amount USD 45 billion ( nearly EUR 30 billion ) in one go .
And , according to reports from US broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ BC , Ci@@ tig@@ ro@@ up is also planning to rep@@ ay the state support .
The institutions thereby want to wi@@ ggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand@@ -in-@@ hand with the acceptance of the money , such as the limits on manager bon@@ uses and the paying of high charges .
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through con@@ verti@@ ble loans .
The rest of the amount was taken from its own k@@ itt@@ y , which was well filled through the sale of business units .
Bank head Kenne@@ th Le@@ wis extended his express thanks to the American taxpay@@ er on Wednesday evening : The cash injection helped over a very difficult time .
The bank over@@ stret@@ ched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Mer@@ ri@@ ll Lyn@@ ch .
Ci@@ tig@@ ro@@ up also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its li@@ abilities with the state .
Already on Thursday , the US bank was able to announce a capital increase of some USD 20 billion , reported CN@@ BC with reference to circles .
A Ci@@ tig@@ ro@@ up spo@@ kes@@ man dec@@ lined to comment .
Gold@@ man Sach@@ s , J@@ P Morgan Ch@@ ase and Morgan Stan@@ ley had already re@@ paid their support in June .
A quick choice
It all happened a lot faster than expected .
Bar@@ ely two weeks after the Z@@ DF board of directors had pushed the acting edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief Nikol@@ aus B@@ render out of office , the broad@@ c@@ aster is able to present his successor .
Yesterday evening , the committee wanted to vote on the appointment .
The favourite was Peter Fre@@ y , head of Z@@ DF &apos;s main studio in Berlin .
But Z@@ DF did not confirm this - officially , not to anticip@@ ate the process .
However , the plan not to further damage Z@@ DF director Markus Sch@@ äch@@ ter , if this suggestion were also not successful with the board of directors , will also have played its part .
Fre@@ y , Sch@@ äch@@ ter &apos;s candidate , needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members .
The result of the vote was not known when going to press .
Two weeks ago Sch@@ äch@@ ter had been un@@ successful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the agreement with Nikol@@ aus B@@ render by another five years .
Only seven members voted for B@@ render , seven were against him . B@@ render &apos;s voting out was a severe blow to Sch@@ äch@@ ter , albeit one to be expected .
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative board had sign@@ aled already weeks before the vote that they would not confirm B@@ render in office .
Rol@@ and K@@ och , the prime minister of H@@ esse , had organised the opposition to the edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief .
With the argument that Z@@ DF &apos;s news broad@@ casts had lost vie@@ wers under B@@ render , he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief .
Until shortly before the election , there were therefore protests in which the exerc@@ ising of political influence on the Z@@ DF was cas@@ tig@@ ated .
Most recently , 35 civil rights campaign@@ ers had even joined the debate and rated the actions of K@@ och to be in breach of the Constitution .
To no av@@ ail .
Personal details
Peter Fre@@ y was born on 4 August 1957 in B@@ ingen .
He studied political and educational sciences and Rom@@ ance studies .
He later worked for the Süd@@ west@@ funk and the Frankfurter Rund@@ schau .
In 1983 Fre@@ y moved to the Z@@ DF , initially to the he@@ ut@@ e-@@ journ@@ al .
Sub@@ sequent activities : From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief ; in 1991 / 92 correspon@@ dent in Washington ; until 1998 head and present@@ er of the Mor@@ gen@@ magaz@@ in ; until 2001 head of Z@@ DF foreign affairs ; then head of the Z@@ DF head studio .
The Greens announced after the voting out of B@@ render , who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin only on Wednesday , to press constitutional charges .
K@@ och &apos;s oppon@@ ent on the board of directors , the R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine prime minister Kur@@ t B@@ eck , explained last week that the states should amend the Z@@ DF treaty to the extend that staff suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority .
However , B@@ eck too ruled out any removal of party politicians from the boards of directors of the Z@@ DF .
B@@ render &apos;s expected successor , Peter Fre@@ y , had recommended himself to the board of directors with a cle@@ ver move - by har@@ sh@@ ly critic@@ ising the committee immediately after it voted out B@@ render .
Thanks to this proof of edi@@ torial independence , both Sch@@ äch@@ ter without losing face and the board of directors were able to vote for his appointment as edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief , without being susp@@ ected of promoting a parti@@ san to this post .
In party calculations , Fre@@ y is reck@@ oned to be a left-@@ le@@ aning liberal anyway .
University courses to be clear@@ ed out
Parti@@ al success for students : After a year of educational strikes , the culture ministers of the states finally came around on Thursday : At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Princip@@ als Conference , both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for b@@ achel@@ or and masters courses .
The students should , in the future , be in a position to master their studies .
In particular , they agreed to reduce the number of exam@@ s : Every module shall , as a rule , be completed with one single ex@@ am .
In addition , the students &apos; work@@ load shall be reviewed and &quot; a realistic and acceptable extent &quot; ensured .
Poli@@ ti@@ cians and coll@@ eg@@ es also want to simplify the recognition of exam@@ s taken between the coll@@ eg@@ es inside and outside Germany .
The states undertake to organise more flexi@@ bly joint structural requirements for b@@ achel@@ or and masters courses .
State regulations devi@@ ating from this , shall not be imposed .
L@@ ess exam@@ s
Since the start of the student protests in June , culture ministers and university princip@@ als have been referring to the dict@@ um of better studi@@ ability .
Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time .
The so-called acc@@ redi@@ tation council has decided to , in part , dramatically reduce the number of exam@@ s : &quot; Every module ends , as a rule , with an ex@@ am , &quot; states the 30-@@ page paper , which is to newly go@@ vern the admission of courses in part .
With the &quot; clear reduction of the examination load &quot; , explains acc@@ redi@@ tation council chairman Rein@@ hold Gri@@ mm , &quot; an undes@@ irable development is to be stopped , which had a grave impact on studi@@ ability &quot; .
In addition , &quot; studi@@ ability &quot; is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the future .
Mod@@ ules and contents &quot; shall be strictly reviewed &quot; as to whether &quot; unnecessary con@@ stric@@ tions on the students in their choice of
events &quot; would be avoided .
The students are &quot; entitled to be granted le@@ eway allowing and promoting initiative &quot; .
The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses .
They need to be &quot; re@@ acc@@ redi@@ ted &quot; every five years , which , however , means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed .
Ten acc@@ redi@@ tation agencies throughout Germany over@@ see this , which report to the Ac@@ credi@@ tation Council set up by the states .
The culture ministers had &quot; expressly &quot; urged the states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exam@@ s regime not too strict .
In some federal states , universities and coll@@ eg@@ es have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state minist@@ ries .
R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process ; so far , it is the only state to do so .
With this money , the coll@@ eg@@ es are , in particular , to set up tut@@ or programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exam@@ s and foreign offices .
The state and coll@@ eg@@ es plan to ear@@ mark 10 million euros for this .
In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the Universi@@ ties Act before parliament .
According to it , only one ex@@ am should be necessary to complete a course model .
The course design is to become more flexible , while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses .
By the end of the coming year , all courses of the state are to be examined for their studi@@ ability .
The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday .
On top of praise , there was also criticism for the decisions .
The federal board of the Young Socialist University Gro@@ ups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place &quot; behind the closed doors &quot; of ministers and university princip@@ als .
After the educational strike , at the latest , students should now also &quot; have their say &quot; as those affected .
The future academ@@ ics received support from the president of the Conference of University Princip@@ als ( HR@@ K ) , Mar@@ gre@@ t Winter@@ mant@@ el : &quot; We need the experiences of the students , &quot; she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers , with whom the HR@@ K was debating a joint reform paper .
The Education and Science Union ( G@@ EW ) deemed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough : It is demanding a legal claim , which would allow every graduate with a b@@ achel@@ or degree admission on a further masters course .
On the other hand , the states must ensure that for the current generation of b@@ achel@@ or students there are sufficient places on master courses with best-@@ possible studying conditions , says G@@ EW executive board member Andreas Keller .
The states must employ significantly more lec@@ tur@@ ers .
The culture ministers did , however , not issue a statement regarding free admission to masters courses .
More than a foot@@ note to Her@@ ta Müller
Go@@ ing in and out of Germany is nice , virtually no checks ... &quot; is the first line of a po@@ em by the po@@ et Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner , in which he describes in distur@@ bing frag@@ ments a dis@@ si@@ dent &apos;s experience of arrival , who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area .
Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner , born in Romania &apos;s Ban@@ at in 195@@ 1 , initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bu@@ char@@ est and later as an editor in a children &apos;s publishing house , before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982 .
S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner has won several literature awards , in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Po@@ etry Re@@ ad@@ ings at the Go@@ e@@ the University , and since 2002 he has been head of the H@@ esse Liter@@ ature Forum in the M@@ ous@@ on Tower in Frankfurt .
He caused a major extra@@ -@@ literary sti@@ r last Tuesday during a conference in Munich , debating &quot; German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Secur@@ itate files &quot; .
Clearly uns@@ ett@@ led and embar@@ rass@@ ed , S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner read out a statement , in which he admitted before Roman@@ o-@@ German writer colleagues , i.e. Richard Wag@@ ner , William Tot@@ ok , Franz Ho@@ d@@ j@@ ak and Hel@@ mu@@ th Frau@@ endor@@ fer , his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service , Secur@@ itate .
Jo@@ intly with some of those present , S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner 1989 had received the German language award in 1989 .
The recruitment attempts started gradually , first in 1971 .
I am , S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner concluded , &quot; therefore someone , who did not put up enough resistance to the intim@@ id@@ ation attempts of the Secur@@ itate . &quot;
The ly@@ ri@@ c@@ ist Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner is IM Walter .
Vir@@ tually at the same time as the awar@@ ding of the Nobel prize for Her@@ ta Müller and her un@@ matched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictator@@ ships , the literary scene and , in particular , the community of German authors with Romanian roots is being sho@@ cked by a case which reveals the dark spots and per@@ fi@@ dy of a political system based on control and sp@@ ying .
Werner S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner is , in@@ as@@ much as can be said on the basis of the current knowledge , not only a perpet@@ r@@ ator , but also a victim .
In his Secur@@ itate file , IM Walter played a part , said after S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner &apos;s con@@ fes@@ sion the literary schol@@ ar Michael Mark@@ el and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him .
He &quot; box@@ ed him out &quot; in all points which were dangerous for him at the time , said Mark@@ el .
He has a moral need to make this statement .
S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner &apos;s statement was in this form unexpected before this audience , although the con@@ fes@@ sion of a former dis@@ si@@ dent and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising .
Germany was a cosy habit@@ at for the Security sp@@ ies , as Her@@ ta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file , 9@@ 14 pages .
Those affected , one can assume , will have gu@@ essed and in some cases even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sor@@ in , Vo@@ ic@@ u and , of course , Walter .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to the now very secure process of viewing St@@ asi files in Germany , the approach to the legacy of Secur@@ itate control is still very diff@@ use .
A systematic clarification has been undermined and hin@@ dered in recent years .
A National Council to Process Secur@@ itate Files ( S@@ N@@ SA@@ S ) , which is comparable to the Bir@@ th@@ ler Authority , was only set up in 1999 , but the release of the files has been very slow .
A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005 .
The fact that the influence of former Secur@@ itate members is still very big in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Her@@ ta Müller by an interview , in which a former Secur@@ itate head from Tim@@ is@@ o@@ ara spoke in derog@@ atory terms of the prize winner .
They is psycho@@ tic , she was , after all , ques@@ tioned more than once .
The in@@ fam@@ y of power believed it could openly speak in the gu@@ ise of freedom of speech .
The S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner case does , as so often in connection with silent gu@@ ilt , raise questions .
Why only now ? Who fell victim ? The le@@ vel-@@ headed reaction of the audience to S@@ ö@@ ll@@ ner &apos;s statement gives rise to the hope that a continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for information than f@@ ing@@ er-@@ pointing and shame .
Regarding the gen@@ esis of Her@@ ta Müller &apos;s oeu@@ vre , who yesterday received the Nobel prize , it is more than a foot@@ note .
The Champ@@ ions League - a side dish
It seemed as if a well-@@ dres@@ sed field sales representative was just coming from a very nice Christmas party , where a sports items manufacturer had handed out goo@@ dies , when the new V@@ f@@ B coach Christian Gro@@ ss in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier got in a called out Merc@@ edes C class at a quarter past mid@@ night . ¨
The man with the striking bald head was still need@@ ing a ch@@ auff@@ eur , as the town was still unknown to him .
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all , no alcohol was involved and the 5@@ 5-@@ year-old was not dr@@ unk .
A nice evening , but tomorrow the work would continue .
Or only just get going .
In the words of the Swiss national , who had only just been employed three days before : &quot; We may have reached the last six@@ teen , &quot; i.e. in the Champ@@ ions League thanks to a 3 : 1 win over Uni@@ rea Ur@@ z@@ ic@@ en@@ i from Romania , &quot; but we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t be blin@@ ded by the success : We are in for a brutal fight against rel@@ eg@@ ation . &quot;
The &quot; far more important task &quot; is scheduled for Sunday .
The Champ@@ ions League performance will have to be repeated in the day-to-@@ day job of the leag@@ ue .
And the again revealed weaknesses after the three quick goals by Mar@@ ica ( 5 . ) , Trä@@ sch ( 8 . ) and P@@ og@@ reb@@ n@@ y@@ ak ( 11 . ) will have to be stopped .
Dra@@ w
The last six@@ teen of the Champ@@ ions League ( first leg 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / second leg 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March ) will be drawn in Ny@@ on on 18 December .
The joy over the excellent start of the Bab@@ bel successor therefore remained mu@@ te .
Not only with the apparent sa@@ vi@@ our , who had given the uns@@ ett@@ led Stuttgart professionals self-@@ confidence , commitment and joy in playing in a short period of time .
&quot; I addressed the players and told them that they must consider their strengths , and urged them to be more courage@@ ous , &quot; explained shr@@ ink Gro@@ ss his so simp@@ le-@@ sound@@ ing recip@@ e for success , which no longer had any effect under therap@@ ist Bab@@ bel .
He set a certain magic ali@@ ght , admitted Bab@@ bel fan L@@ ehm@@ ann , &quot; When now impul@@ ses are given in football , things happen which are considered to be impossible &quot; .
And Sam@@ i K@@ he@@ di@@ ra , who became the man of the match thanks to his dynamic approach having been injured for weeks , tried to describe the &quot; phenomenon &quot; with the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al &quot; bre@@ ath of fresh air &quot; and the work approach of the new bo@@ ss : &quot; He is a man who takes dr@@ astic measures and demands discipline .
That is what we need in the current situation . &quot;
Under B@@ abel this was clearly lacking .
V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart is still not out of the woods , war@@ ns sports director Hor@@ st Hel@@ dt
But V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart needs , more than anything , consistency .
Like Gro@@ ss , players and managers were e@@ ager not to over@@ estimate the win over the depl@@ eted and hop@@ eless@@ ly over@@ bur@@ dened defence of the Romanian guests .
They had also won in Glas@@ go@@ w before the hor@@ ri@@ bly aw@@ ak@@ ening three days later in L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en in the 0 : 4 , warned K@@ he@@ di@@ ra .
And sports director Hor@@ st Hel@@ dt pointed out that one aim of the season had been achieved , but that the other one was still a long way off .
We are not out of the woods yet .
The fact that Hel@@ dt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40@@ th birthday and even on the first home win for three months , had to do with the events of the weekend , which were revi@@ ved in the form of a TV interview with go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper J@@ ens L@@ ehm@@ ann , which was scre@@ ened immediately before the match .
There are decisions which other people take and not J@@ ens , was Hel@@ dt &apos;s response to L@@ ehm@@ ann &apos;s harsh criticism .
He had accused the directors of a lack of leadership , who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pu@@ bes@@ cent fans .
The fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled , was also rated by L@@ ehm@@ ann as a sign of a lack of authority and res@@ ent@@ ment .
L@@ ehm@@ ann &apos;s statements were &quot; guided by pure eg@@ o@@ ism &quot; , rep@@ lied Hel@@ dt and announced consequences for the ke@@ eper .
It is unlikely they will become friends for life .
But , after all , they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of co@@ aches , the strong performance , both in terms of play and spirit , would not have been possible .
B@@ abel and seine assist@@ ants had &quot; a great share in the success &quot; , said Hel@@ dt and L@@ ehm@@ ann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed .
World@@ cup heav@@ y@@ weight box match
He@@ ated du@@ el in B@@ erne : Chall@@ enger Kev@@ in John@@ son kept provo@@ king world champion Vit@@ ali Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko with words and gest@@ ures .
But after twelve hard rounds , the Ukrainian defended his heav@@ y@@ weight title according to the W@@ BC .
The ver@@ dict of the judges was unanimous .
Hamburg - Vit@@ ali Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko remains heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ing world champion .
On Saturday night in B@@ erne the 3@@ 8-@@ year-old champion ( the W@@ BC association version , ) beat the American Kev@@ in John@@ son unanimously by points ( 120 : 108 , 120 : 108 , 1@@ 19 : 10@@ 9 ) .
For Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko this was his third successful defence of his title since his com@@ eb@@ ack in October 2008 .
Before , the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the W@@ B@@ O and W@@ BC associations .
Unfortunately , the kno@@ ck-@@ out , which everybody had expected , did not materi@@ alise .
Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches , twice he had to give in due to injury .
Chall@@ enger John@@ son saw his first defeat in 24 fi@@ ghts .
In front of some 17@@ ,000 spec@@ t@@ ators in the B@@ erne Arena , the 2.@@ 0@@ 2-@@ met@@ re t@@ all Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko aimed to dict@@ ate the match predomin@@ antly with his left h@@ itting hand .
But the el@@ even cen@@ timet@@ res shorter John@@ son , how had announced the end of the Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko era before the fight , kept ev@@ ading the h@@ its from the world champion , meaning that Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko was not able to apply a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand .
Overall , the passive John@@ son did not do enough for a chall@@ enger and simply tried to survive the rounds .
Although he prov@@ oked Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko with words and gest@@ ures , his b@@ lows only rarely hit the world champion .
Nevertheless , he is only the second box@@ ed since Tim@@ o Hoff@@ mann in 2000 who fight the full twelve rounds against Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko .
The chall@@ enger had caused quite a sti@@ r in the Swiss capital before the fight .
He ins@@ ul@@ ted Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko as &quot; an ug@@ ly z@@ om@@ b@@ ie &quot; , who &quot; cannot do anything at all &quot; .
During weigh@@ ing , the champion then allowed himself to be prov@@ oked to kno@@ ck John@@ son &apos;s s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses of his nose &quot; to be able to see into his eyes . &quot;
Four@@ th victory after Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko &apos;s return
Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko came out on top in his fourth fight since his com@@ eb@@ ack on 11 October 2008 .
After a sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal nearly four years , he beat the Nig@@ eri@@ an Sam@@ uel Peter in Berlin and reg@@ ained &quot; his &quot; W@@ BC belt , which he had been forced to hand over before without a fight .
This year he then beat in the defence of his title the Cuban Juan Carlos Gom@@ ez from and Chris Ar@@ re@@ ola from the US in September .
I only took one blow in this fight , and am physi@@ cally in very good shape , Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko said after the quick return to the ring .
His dream , however , remains the unification of all important titles in his family .
Bro@@ ther V@@ ladimir is world champion of the W@@ B@@ O and IB@@ F associations .
But the W@@ BA belt is worn by Brit@@ an David Hay@@ e after he de@@ th@@ ron@@ ed the 2.@@ 13@@ -@@ met@@ re t@@ all Nikol@@ ay Valu@@ ev in November .
Hay@@ e had previously cancelled in the summer a fight planned to take place in September against Vit@@ ali Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko .
Appar@@ ently , his promotion company is now already planning a fight against Kli@@ t@@ ch@@ ko at London &apos;s W@@ emb@@ ley stadium .
The Kun@@ du@@ z case
Front@@ al attack from the opposition : Green party head Jür@@ gen T@@ rit@@ tin calls defence minister Gut@@ ten@@ berg a li@@ ar for providing false information on the Kun@@ du@@ z affair .
SP@@ D and Left Party demanding a clarification from the Chancellor .
Hamburg / Berlin - After the recent re@@ vel@@ ations regarding the air raid of Kun@@ du@@ z , the opposition has accused defence minister Kar@@ l-@@ The@@ od@@ or zu Gut@@ ten@@ berg ( CS@@ U ) of deliber@@ ate dec@@ eption .
The minister apparently made &quot; know@@ ingly false statements &quot; regarding the fat@@ al bom@@ bing of two tank tra@@ ilers in September , said Green party head Jür@@ gen T@@ rit@@ tin on Saturday in the AR@@ D news programme Tages@@ schau .
This is generally referred to as lying .
The order to kill was given in de@@ fi@@ ance of the rules of the International Security Assi@@ stance Force ( IS@@ A@@ F ) for Afghanistan .
That is the substance of the report , which NATO had , which Mr. Gut@@ ten@@ berg has read , said T@@ rit@@ tin .
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the ab@@ duc@@ ted t@@ ank@@ ers , but also to specifically kill two Tal@@ eb@@ an leaders .
The US air strike ordered by the German Kun@@ du@@ z comm@@ ander Col@@ on@@ el Kl@@ ein , up to 142 people were killed of injured , according to the NATO inquiry report .
The Greens , SP@@ D and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Gut@@ ten@@ berg really knew about the event .
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government &apos;s Afghanistan policy , and whether the Chancellor &apos;s Office , German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy , demanded Jür@@ gen T@@ rit@@ tin and his Greens colleague Ren@@ ate Kün@@ ast .
Government spo@@ kes@@ man Ul@@ rich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resol@@ utely .
The Chancellor &apos;s Office did not take any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan , he said .
On Saturday , doubts over the presentation by the mini@@ stry of the background of the dis@@ miss@@ al of In@@ spec@@ tor General Wolfgang Schnei@@ der@@ han and State Secretary Peter Wich@@ ert emerged .
According to information available to SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL , the two provided Gut@@ ten@@ berg with correct and complete information on the background of the tan@@ ker tra@@ iler attack .
Offici@@ ally , it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister .
From the ent@@ our@@ age of the top official , however , it was said that the defence mini@@ stry had even been directed to several reports , including a two-@@ page documents of the comm@@ anding colon@@ el Kl@@ ein and a report from the military police .
In the meantime , Wich@@ ert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter , reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonn@@ tags@@ zei@@ tung .
He has not received a response , it is claimed .
The mini@@ stry did not comment on the accus@@ ations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament , which would be set up next Wednesday .
Dre@@ am worlds
Some see images and hear voices when they are aw@@ ake which others do not hear or see .
Not only in the ment@@ ally sick and during in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become bl@@ urred .
As long as this happens in sleep , things are fine .
When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed , we can sur@@ render to the wild@@ est imag@@ inations and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es without restra@@ int .
But anybody experiencing dre@@ am-@@ like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are aw@@ ake , is regarded in contemporary Western society as a ma@@ d@@ man or drug ad@@ dict , or strange at the very least .
But such images and voices are formed not only in the ment@@ ally sick or during drug in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
This is down to our imagination : The same ne@@ ural processes which allow us to design houses , draw paintings or write no@@ vels can make the borders between dream , ma@@ dness and reality become bl@@ urred .
Con@@ sci@@ ous conditions which are war@@ ped like dreams can occur in the most different forms , in the best case we call them visions , in the worst case ma@@ dness .
Even if their tri@@ gg@@ ers and effects may differ , the visions of my@@ stic Hil@@ de@@ g@@ ard von B@@ ingen , the drug experiences of New Age proph@@ et Carlos Cast@@ an@@ eda , sham@@ an det@@ ach@@ ment from reality conditions , psycho@@ ses and hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations can be tra@@ ced back to similar processes .
Hall@@ uc@@ ination or del@@ u@@ sions occur when the balance of the ne@@ ural tran@@ smit@@ ters of the brain - predomin@@ antly d@@ op@@ am@@ ine nor@@ ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine , ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ ch@@ ol@@ ine - der@@ ails and the interaction of different brain segments is d@@ ys@@ functional .
Comp@@ lex hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and del@@ u@@ sional thoughts often occur during schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic psycho@@ ses .
Gra@@ vity no longer has any power over him
The connection between ma@@ dness and dream has occupied philosoph@@ ers and doctors since ancient times .
A@@ rist@@ ot@@ le understood hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations to be a form of dream while aw@@ ake , Wilhelm Gri@@ es@@ inger , a founder of modern psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry , detected in 18@@ 61 a &quot; huge simil@@ arity of ma@@ dness and dre@@ am@@ like conditions &quot; , for Sig@@ mund Fre@@ ud dreams were even &quot; a psycho@@ sis , with all pu@@ zz@@ les , del@@ u@@ sions and mis@@ perc@@ ep@@ tions of such &quot; .
It is autumn 2001 when H@@ enn@@ ing T. turns into a com@@ ic figure .
His body is two-@@ dimensional and exc@@ essively gau@@ dy .
Gra@@ vity no longer has any power over him , he flo@@ ats at the ceiling of the room .
He feels a k@@ ick .
Beh@@ ind him are wing@@ ed devi@@ lish figures with red , distor@@ ted faces , s@@ nar@@ ling .
They h@@ unt him , k@@ ick him with heavy , fl@@ aming bo@@ ots , throw him against walls , he feels the pain all over his body .
Lou@@ d , evil voices emerge from the walls and radio .
He can no longer stand them , the voices that abuse and ins@@ ult him .
H@@ enn@@ ing T. pul@@ ls two c@@ ables out of the ster@@ eo system , ties them to a k@@ not and att@@ aches it to a h@@ ook on the ceiling .
He clim@@ bs on a speaker and puts the no@@ ose around his neck .
He j@@ umps .
The no@@ ose becomes loose .
Let that be a lesson to you , the voices scre@@ am in an ear@@ dru@@ m-@@ t@@ ear@@ ing cho@@ ir , &quot; go to the clin@@ ic and get treated ! &quot;
Today , H@@ enn@@ ing T. is 40 years old , he has had six acute psycho@@ ses , the last one is two years back , the first nearly 20 years ago .
It was caused by L@@ SD .
His diagnosis is a schi@@ zo@@ aff@@ ectiv@@ e-@@ par@@ ano@@ id psycho@@ sis , he is also a man@@ ic-@@ de@@ pressive , he takes drugs against depression , the man@@ ia and schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
He has learned to live with his illness , he has been married for three years .
In psycho@@ sis I experienced the worst fear and deep@@ est desper@@ ation , he says .
The illu@@ sions are a brutal reality
About 1 per cent of the population suff@@ ers at least once in their lifetime from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia ; in psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c clin@@ ics , it is treated with a frequency only second to depression .
In an acute schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic psycho@@ sis , people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world , they reach an over@@ exc@@ ited condition which can result in hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania , par@@ ano@@ ia or persecution man@@ ia .
Partic@@ ularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command , comment or involve in dialogue .
Visual hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are also not rare .
The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from un@@ important things , the brain can no longer filter out distur@@ bing signals , the conscious is floo@@ ded by impres@@ sions .
Like dreams , a psycho@@ sis also opens the floo@@ d@@ gates on a flood of ideas and ph@@ anta@@ si@@ es , which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious .
The perception of reality in a psycho@@ sis is subj@@ ec@@ t-@@ cent@@ red , says professor Thomas Fu@@ chs , senior physi@@ cian at the Clin@@ ic for General Psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at the University Clin@@ ic of Heidelberg .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients are at the heart of the events , the meaning of everything is directed to him .
At the same time , he finds himself in a passive role , he is , like in a dream , overwhel@@ med by the events can cannot affect them actively .
Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic patients therefore often feel threatened , controlled and manipul@@ ated .
A reality comparison is often not available to them , the illu@@ sions are a brutal reality , w@@ aking up is not possible .
To experience a hall@@ uc@@ ination once in your life
Con@@ tr@@ ary to dreams , says Fu@@ chs , &quot; the sen@@ su@@ al and spati@@ al structure of reality , as perceived during a psycho@@ sis , remains int@@ act as a rule &quot; .
The del@@ u@@ sional thoughts and hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are based in reality , the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality .
Prec@@ isely why our brain plays such tri@@ cks on us , is still pu@@ zz@@ ling to scientists .
Extra@@ ordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time , says Fu@@ chs .
But not everybody will develop a psycho@@ sis .
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , but studies of tw@@ ins have shown that genes are not the sole factor .
Scienti@@ sts assume that patients have minimal brain damage .
We think that the neur@@ onal mat@@ uring of the brain is distur@@ bed in an early stage of development , through a virus infection in the mother during pregn@@ ancy , for instance , explains Fu@@ chs .
But it remains a myst@@ ery how distur@@ ban@@ ces to the neur@@ onal system comes about which also do not become mani@@ fest for many years initially .
Environmental imp@@ acts also play a part - stress or traum@@ atic experiences can trigger psycho@@ ses if the dis@@ position is given .
Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ gen drugs can trigger psycho@@ ses , as they interfere with the tran@@ smit@@ ter system .
When our brain runs hot
The mad thing is that psycho@@ tics suffer from their hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and take expensive medic@@ ation to get rid of them , others spend money on drugs to get the same , says Lü@@ bec@@ k-@@ based psych@@ ology professor E@@ rich Ka@@ sten .
Whether these illu@@ sions are perceived to be pleasant or un@@ pleasant is often only a matter of perspective .
Ka@@ sten has been collecting reports for ten years on hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and del@@ u@@ sions ; last year he assessed his results in a book ti@@ tled The un@@ real World in our Head .
Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are a typical by-@@ product of psycho@@ ses , but also of a remark@@ ably large amount of other diseases .
These include , on top of mental ill@@ nesses such as bor@@ der@@ line or depression , also often diseases such as m@@ ig@@ ra@@ ine , epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy , multiple sc@@ ler@@ o@@ sis or Alz@@ heimer &apos;s disease and traum@@ atic brain in@@ jur@@ ies .
Sur@@ pris@@ ingly , even the brain of healthy people hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ates under certain conditions .
Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , says Ka@@ sten , consist of memory frag@@ ments , which are often held back .
They occur when areas of the brain , where sens@@ ory perc@@ ep@@ tions are processed , are over@@ active or not sufficiently res@@ trained ; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stim@@ ulation .
Dru@@ gs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psycho@@ sis .
But sens@@ ory de@@ priv@@ ation , stress , lo@@ ves@@ ick@@ ness or other mental exceptional conditions too .
In more recent studies , up to one third of respon@@ dents claimed to have experienced a hall@@ uc@@ ination at least once in their lives .
In summer 2005 Sar@@ ah K. is 16 years old , she is living in a small town in Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg-@@ Vor@@ p@@ omm@@ ern and goes to the local secondary school .
Indeed , a perfectly normal girl .
It it were not for the images and voices .
During breaks , it can happen that a lan@@ ky boy with long dark hair approaches her .
When she answers him , her school@@ m@@ ates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or h@@ ears this boy .
They think the girls is a nut@@ ty day@@ dre@@ amer , but Sar@@ ah K. is not dre@@ aming , she knows that much .
She is aw@@ ake , she sees and h@@ ears this boy , just like she sees and h@@ ears the girl at the desk next to her .
She can even feel his presence , at least for some moments .
A pleasant feeling it is , she likes the boy .
Am I mad ? she sometimes asks .
But she knows that this boy and the other illu@@ sions are not real and disappear again .
At night the appear@@ ances are usually fri@@ gh@@ tening
The illu@@ sions are often a stra@@ in .
When she is sitting in the class@@ room , she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new school@@ m@@ ate , while she is expl@@ aining mathemati@@ cal equ@@ ations on the black@@ board for everyone else .
At night the appear@@ ances are usually fri@@ gh@@ tening .
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room , which comes far too rarely and late , she often cannot distinguish whether she is aw@@ ake or already dre@@ aming , whether the images she sees , the gri@@ m@@ aces or the girl with the ble@@ eding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes .
Let me be , she scre@@ ams at the figures .
She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this , they would think she was mad .
Aut@@ umn 2009 . Sar@@ ah K. is 20 years old now .
She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boy@@ friend .
A year ago the hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations stopped .
Since she cont@@ acted psych@@ ologist Ka@@ sten via the internet , she knows exactly that she is not mad .
Mad@@ ness is also work of art born out of desper@@ ation
If someone is socially isolated or suff@@ ers from sens@@ ory de@@ priv@@ ation , he will very probably suffer from hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations after some time , says Ka@@ sten .
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment .
Sar@@ ah K. , a single child , was afraid of other children when she was small ; she often played alone .
Her hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father .
As during visual and acous@@ tic hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impres@@ sions and sounds , it is often difficult for patients like Sar@@ ah K. to distinguish between illu@@ sions and reality . &quot; Every experience , &quot; says Ka@@ sten , &quot; takes place in the brain , reality is re@@ produced there .
Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations are also images , which the brain creates , this is why they seem so real . &quot;
Illu@@ sions at night are also classified by Ka@@ sten as a form of hall@@ uc@@ ination .
The hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psycho@@ sis .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ene patients , ment@@ ally healthy people are able to identify illu@@ sions as un@@ real .
Ka@@ sten therefore advis@@ es his patients to appreciate hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations as a special ability .
B@@ order between dream and hall@@ uc@@ ination
In our far too consci@@ ous@@ -@@ cent@@ red world , imag@@ inary experiencing is often unfortunately path@@ olog@@ ised , says Michael Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ D@@ egen@@ hard , professor in Heidelberg and senior physi@@ cian of the Clin@@ ic for Psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry and Psy@@ cho@@ therapy of the Florence Ni@@ ght@@ ing@@ ale Hospital in Düsseldorf .
A psycho@@ sis is a severe , painful illness , but it also brings positive aspects , creativity - ma@@ dness is also a work of art born out of desper@@ ation .
Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ D@@ egen@@ hard has resear@@ ched the so-called on@@ ei@@ ro@@ id experience , a particular form of conscious conditions which are war@@ ped like dreams .
On@@ ei@@ ro@@ ids are highly complex , detailed quasi dreams , which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being aw@@ ake .
The on@@ ei@@ ro@@ id condition occurs in trau@@ ma@@ - or si@@ ck@@ ness@@ -@@ related extreme situations , for instance in poly@@ radi@@ cu@@ li@@ tis patients , who experience a motor par@@ aly@@ sis in full consciousness .
If a person is threatened by sel@@ f@@ - or world loss , for instance due to persistent , complete loss of mobility , he re@@ places the life-@@ threatening real situation with an own , imag@@ inary world , which is unc@@ ou@@ pled from reality , says Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ D@@ egen@@ hard .
A kind of border between dream and hall@@ uc@@ ination
As the ma@@ stering of a situation is not possible in reality , a change of world takes place , but the real situation is not updated in the imagination .
An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbe@@ ar@@ able situation , which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emp@@ tin@@ ess of a loss of consciousness .
Everything is real , even later in the memory
The Z@@ uri@@ ch-@@ based art hist@@ orian Peter Corn@@ eli@@ us Cl@@ aus@@ sen also describes his on@@ ei@@ ro@@ id experiences in his book A Change of Hear@@ t as the sole &apos;s attempt to safe itself .
He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on jour@@ neys for days after heart val@@ ve surgery with subsequent heart transplan@@ tation while his body is dam@@ ned to im@@ mobility in the intensive care unit .
Cl@@ aus@@ sen del@@ ves into a world of his creation , visits foreign places and times : He experiences himself as a bed@@ ri@@ dden , old man , on board a train san@@ atorium , a ro@@ bot watching over his health .
He lives in the early Middle A@@ ges amongst no@@ b@@ lem@@ en who make in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ants from blood .
He is ab@@ duc@@ ted by a Greek man on his motor@@ bike to his hom@@ eland , sur@@ fs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the ma@@ fia .
He is fully taken up with the imag@@ inary events ; everything is real , even later in his memory .
These inner trips , Cl@@ aus@@ sen believes , are fundamentally different from every dream .
Dre@@ am is a different condition , he describes his experience .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to that , the memories from mental trips are over@@ tly clear to me even after years and in minute detail .
Even clearer and more intense that real events .
The intensity of this experience breaks the horiz@@ on of our day-to-@@ day experiences , says psy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist Sch@@ mid@@ t-@@ D@@ egen@@ hard .
Ultim@@ ately , on@@ ei@@ ro@@ ids , psycho@@ ses , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations and drug in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation show how fragile our images of the external reality are , even when aw@@ ake .
Every change to the conscious , summ@@ arises psych@@ ologist Ka@@ sten , &quot; can result in a war@@ ping of what we call reality &quot; .
An experience which can indeed be enrich@@ ing .

Bur@@ da
Children set to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
K@@ allen , the new head of the publishing house , is an interim solution : In the long term , Hu@@ bert Bur@@ da wants his company to be taken over by his two children , he has told the SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL magazine .
The holding is to remain to 100 % in the family .
Hamburg - The publish@@ er Hu@@ bert Bur@@ da sees the long-term future of his company in his children &apos;s hands .
Both children will inher@@ it at the age of 27 and are strongly intent on joining the company , the 6@@ 9-@@ year-old has told the SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL magazine .
The details have already been organised as a precau@@ tion .
The question whether they will be active in the company will only arise later .
Also the question whether they are able to do so .
One cannot put one &apos;s children in charge of 7,@@ 500 employees if they are not capable of this .
That will kill the children , and the company with them .
On Thursday , Bur@@ da announced that he would be resign@@ ing from his post as chairman as of January and appointed Pau@@ l@@ -B@@ ern@@ hard K@@ allen as his successor .
5@@ 2-@@ year-old K@@ allen has been a member of the board at Bur@@ da since 1999 .
He was initially responsible for technology .
Later , with the Treas@@ ury department , he assumed responsibility for the company assets , and after Jür@@ gen To@@ den@@ hö@@ fer &apos;s departure , also for direct marketing , foreign operations , print and finances .
For the first time , a person who is not a family member is thus at the hel@@ m of the publishing house .
Bur@@ da &apos;s children are 19 and 17 ; his son Feli@@ x , who would be 42 today , died a couple of years ago .
The appointment of K@@ allen is designed to &quot; bridge 10 , 15 years &quot; , says Bur@@ da .
The holding is to remain to 100 per cent in family ownership , said Bur@@ da .
In light of the cases of Sch@@ ick@@ ed@@ anz and Sch@@ a@@ eff@@ ler , Bur@@ da stated that family-@@ owned companies are not safe from going under either : &quot; That always affected families who were infected with a capital ad@@ diction , who spec@@ ulated wron@@ g@@ ly and through they could advance to become a really big player .
That never was my strategy .
He never had &quot; dreams of world power &quot; , says Bur@@ da .
I do not see myself as a political prec@@ ep@@ tor of the country , as Sp@@ ring@@ er was , and I do not want to participate in the world leag@@ ue with Time magazine , these companies have become too big .

En@@ des@@ a and Barcelona with the electric car
The electric company En@@ des@@ a , together with Barcelona City Council , has created &apos; Office L@@ IVE . &apos;
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catal@@ an capital .
Office L@@ IVE &apos; ( Log@@ istics for the Implement@@ ation of the Electri@@ c V@@ eh@@ ic@@ le ) will define and coordinate the road@@ map for the implementation of the electric car in the city , and will define the conditions for mobility , management , coordination , present subsidies , etc .
Moreover , MO@@ V@@ EL@@ E will develop the project , promote the electric car , review public opinion and work from the sectors involved .
In short , it hopes to promote what will be the transportation of the future .
3 &apos; electric ci@@ ti@@ es@@ &apos;
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain .
Madrid and Seville are joining the project .
They are the three cities chosen by the Government to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle within the MO@@ V@@ EL@@ E plan .
The electric company En@@ des@@ a has already signed a framework agreement with the Gener@@ alit@@ at of Catal@@ onia .
With that , it hopes to promote the activities of the Research and Techn@@ ological Development in the Autonom@@ ous Community of Catal@@ onia .
These include activities linked to energy and , in particular , energy efficiency .
It is not the only initiative En@@ des@@ a is involved in regarding the promotion of the electric vehicle .
The company particip@@ ates in standardi@@ zation groups at the European level and has a series of active complementary projects , such as G@@ 4@@ V , EL@@ V@@ IR@@ E and C@@ EN@@ IT VER@@ DE .
Zap@@ ater@@ o sees &apos; a horiz@@ on of peace &apos; for the automotive sector .
The Prime Minister , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez Zap@@ ater@@ o , cat@@ ches a gli@@ mp@@ se of &apos; a horiz@@ on of peace &apos; for the Spanish automotive industry , which , he pointed out , is the principal export sector in the country .
In the Prime Minister &apos;s presentation of the Economic Report for 2009 , Zap@@ ater@@ o reviewed the measures the government had launched throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector .
&quot; Without the Autom@@ otive Com@@ peti@@ tiveness Plan , today we would have a panorama of negl@@ ect and the closure of some of our major production plants , &quot; the Prime Minister explained .
&quot; Through this plan and the arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly competitive sector in Spain , we can have a horiz@@ on of peace for the future of this industry , which is our principal export sector , &quot; he added .
In this regard , he rec@@ alled that the@@ Com@@ peti@@ tiveness Plan , included in the Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive Plan of the Autom@@ obile Industry ( P@@ IA ) , allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary companies , which mobili@@ zed an investment of more than 3 billion euros .
The head of the Executive Bran@@ ch explained that this investment was committed as much to the development of new models as it was to upgra@@ ding already existing products and processes .
Zap@@ ater@@ o also stressed the government &apos;s measures to support the demand , all@@ u@@ ding to Plan 200@@ 0@@ E , implemented in collaboration with the Autonom@@ ous Communities and automotive brand .
According to the Prime Minister , this plan has reduced emissions by 6 % in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has brought about a &quot; sharp increase &quot; in en@@ roll@@ ment , which rose by &quot; 40 percent &quot; in November ..
20@@ ,000 square meters of classic vehicles .
The first year of the International Classic Car Show@@ room will be celebrated in Madrid , a meeting place for professionals and am@@ ate@@ urs of the motor world .
This initiative will take place from the 5th to the 7th of February , 2010 in the Gl@@ ass Pavi@@ lion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid .
This is a 20@@ ,000 square meter exhibition area , and more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be there .
Not only will you find classic motor@@ cycles and cars at Classi@@ c@@ Auto Madrid , there will also be all kinds of products related to the motor world .
So you will find the exhibitors at the pa@@ vi@@ lion disp@@ laying accessories , parts , components , textile accessories , compl@@ ements , publications , mini@@ atures , etc .
H@@ und@@ reds of items related to the world of classic mot@@ ors will delight coll@@ ectors and the cur@@ ious .
Particip@@ ating companies will include Cl@@ á@@ si@@ cos de Mo@@ s and Good Old Times , automobile sales ; Juan L@@ umbr@@ eras , restoration ; Cou@@ pe-@@ Francisco Pu@@ e@@ che , automobile sales and restoration , and Co@@ cher Cl@@ á@@ si@@ cos , Merc@@ edes B@@ enz specialists .

Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 i-@@ Stop : Sustain@@ able spor@@ ts@@ manship
Ma@@ z@@ da wants to show that spor@@ ts@@ manship is not in@@ compatible with the environment .
Therefore , Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 has just added an engine st@@ opping and starting system - du@@ b@@ bed as the i-@@ Stop - , a mechanism which is , for the moment at least , only available with the 15@@ 0-@@ horse power 2.0 pet@@ rol engine .
This second generation of the Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 stands out for its overall high ratings .
The fin@@ ishes , features , comfort , performance , mechan@@ ics , the i-@@ Stop system …
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 .
Starting with the driver &apos;s seat , we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonom@@ ics and support .
The feel of the ste@@ ering wheel is also exquisite .
Mo@@ ving on to th@@ ec@@ om@@ bin@@ ation of the d@@ ash@@ board and console , we see how Ma@@ z@@ da has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futur@@ istic interior design with a great deal of buttons , kno@@ bs and striking red and blue colors .
This style remin@@ ds us , in part , of the Hon@@ da Civi@@ c .
So , we can say that the Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 and the Civi@@ c , both Japanese , contrast with the so@@ bri@@ ety of the German products , more specifically , the Volkswagen Golf , which everyone wants to beat .
Continu@@ ing with the interior , this Japanese compact is easily ro@@ om@@ y enough for four adults to travel in great comfort .
All of this comes with a spacious tr@@ unk and standard dimensions .
The engine &apos;s automatic st@@ opping and starting system , at least for now , is only available with the two-@@ li@@ ter , 15@@ 0-@@ hor@@ se-@@ power , manual , six-@@ gear , pet@@ rol engine .
This engine is a real deli@@ ght@@ .@@ What makes it outstanding are its sub@@ t@@ l@@ ety , reduced noise levels , features and fuel consumption .
And even though the diesel versions of the Mad@@ z@@ da@@ 3 will be in higher demand , those who don &apos;t do too much mi@@ le@@ age a year should not dis@@ miss this i-@@ Stop pet@@ rol engine system , both for its elev@@ ated driving comfort and its fuel consumption .
As regards the level of the equipment , the version chosen for the test is called the Spor@@ tive , meaning@@ it incorpor@@ ates a high number of standard elements .
The standard equipment is excellent , especially the lan@@ e changing assi@@ stant ( R@@ V@@ M ) which elimin@@ ates the blind spot , the trac@@ tion and stability controls , the speed control , the interior photo@@ sensitive mirror , the large-@@ screen on@@ board computer , the parking sensors , independent climate control , rain and lights sensor , Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio , and 17 &quot; allo@@ y wheels .
Additionally , with less equipment , this version comes with the Premium Pack , which , for 1,@@ 500 euros , also features : bi@@ -@@ x@@ enon adap@@ tive head@@ lights and a B@@ OS@@ E sound system with CD chan@@ ger , among other things .
Con@@ clu@@ sion
The Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 2.0 i-@@ Stop is one of the best comp@@ acts in its category .
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used , its performance , and the high standard of its equipment .
Additionally , those who do less y@@ early mi@@ le@@ age can opt for this version of the i-@@ Stop , associated only with the 15@@ 0-@@ hor@@ se-@@ power 2.0 engine .
The only draw@@ back of this model is its high price , which ranges from 2@@ 1,@@ 7@@ 70 euros for the Lux@@ ury pack to 23@@ ,@@ 2@@ 70 euros for the Spor@@ tive version , tested here .
In exchange for the high price , the Ma@@ z@@ da@@ 3 will offer a large daily dose of satisfaction .

The promise of Fon@@ Pe@@ ek
Pe@@ ek is extremely limited , a device that &apos;s only used for checking email , without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attach@@ ments or surfing the web .
It enjoyed its 5 minutes of f@@ ame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year .
Se@@ eing it on the street is more difficult , to be honest , but the idea can be interesting , especially for children .
Unlike sm@@ art@@ phones , the Pe@@ ek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee , less than half , for example , of the iPhone &apos;s data plan .
Given its success , the company has released two new devices : one exclusively for Twitter , the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Pe@@ ek .
Fon@@ Pe@@ ek , presented at the La Web event yesterday , is the European version of the inv@@ ention and its third inc@@ ar@@ nation .
It is just as limited as its U.S. counter@@ part , but comes with a surprise .
The monthly service price , around 12 euros a month , includes ro@@ aming throughout Europe .
Those who travel with a sm@@ art@@ phone already know what it &apos;s like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desper@@ ately search for a caf@@ e with WiFi ( or a F@@ on connection ) to check their mail .
The idea of fix@@ ed-@@ price ro@@ aming is incredibly attractive and long awa@@ ited .
Yes , some operators have special arrangements and travel plans , but in my experience it takes a doc@@ torate in physi@@ cs to understand them and good gl@@ asses to read the fine print .
The repeated twi@@ sting of the European Commission &apos;s arm to get affordable ro@@ aming rates across Europe has had almost no notic@@ eable effect .
There &apos;s a fear of using data outside one &apos;s home country , and rightly so .
For a g@@ ad@@ get like the Fon@@ Pe@@ ek ( it no longer seems strange that it is called F@@ on since it lacks WiFi ) to get this kind of fee , it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of rec@@ ou@@ ping the cost of their data networks .
The Kin@@ dle is another good example , including a book downloading feature and other internet queries .
No contracts , no bo@@ ther .
It &apos;s a connected device and is paid for when it &apos;s purchased , not month by month .
And that is what I hope to see one day with Fon@@ Pe@@ ek , a call option with life-@@ time access , which the Pe@@ ek already has in the U.S.
Not because I &apos;m going to buy it .
I check my mail on my phone , thank you .
I hope so because I think it &apos;s an unfair model for the consumer .
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system .
Mich@@ elle &apos;s color fe@@ tish
Y@@ ellow is , without a doubt , the U.S. First Lady &apos;s favorite color .
She already attended Bar@@ ak Obama &apos;s inau@@ gur@@ ation as U.S. president in a yellow dress and coat ; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life : the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo .
Mich@@ elle Obama wor@@ e a very similar dress on both occasions : apart from being a similar y@@ el@@ low-@@ green color with bright highligh@@ ts@@ - , both times the out@@ fit consi@@ sted of three pieces , a dress , jack@@ et and coat of the same material , and was ad@@ or@@ ned with a large em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y or nec@@ kl@@ ace .
So much so that , at first gl@@ ance , it seemed the first lady of the U.S. has been following the Princ@@ ess of Ast@@ uri@@ as &apos; lead and has op@@ ted to repeat her war@@ dro@@ be .
But the material the two suits are made of make them very different .
If the inau@@ gur@@ ation was about thick l@@ ace , in Oslo it was pat@@ tern@@ ed vel@@ v@@ et .
The accessories have also varied : green medium-@@ he@@ eled shoes the other time , and now a similar design , but in gold .
And equally different is the hair style : on this occasion , hair tied back ; previously she wor@@ e her hair down .
75 % of working mothers have had work problems during mat@@ ernity .
Dis@@ crimin@@ ation at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers .
This has been revealed by a study entitled &apos; Fer@@ tili@@ ty and work history of women in Spain &apos; , developed by the CS@@ IC in collaboration with the Women &apos;s Institute .
The survey of 9,@@ 7@@ 37 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it : 75 % of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to mat@@ ernity .
The study notes that there are many differences in when couples start co@@ hab@@ iting , in the number of children , depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do .
Those that don &apos;t have an activity outside of the home , work part time , or don &apos;t have a stable job start living with their partner sooner , expect their first child , and have more children .
By contrast , women with a stable job , especially in the public sector , put off co@@ hab@@ itation and mo@@ ther@@ hood and have fewer off@@ spring .
&quot; Women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child , on average , 3.@@ 7 years after starting to live together , a figure which increases to 4.@@ 1 ; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals , which has led them to postp@@ one getting married and having children .
Additionally , the type of job held has a great influence over mat@@ ernity , but less over the m@@ ating schedule , &quot; explains CS@@ IC resear@@ cher , Margar@@ ita Del@@ g@@ ado .
Level of education is another factor whi@@ ch@@ differenti@@ ates the age of women mar@@ rying and having their first child .
According to the survey , the higher the level of education , the older the age at which they get married and have their first child .
There was also a difference among women from the same generation .
For example , in a group of 35@@ - to 4@@ 9-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , those who had el@@ ementary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time , on average , at 2@@ 5.@@ 1 and 3@@ 2.1 respectively .
Their level of education provides yet another division among women .
While those who have an el@@ ementary education mar@@ ry and have their first child before finding a stable job , those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a pre@@ condition to marriage and having a child , &quot; Del@@ g@@ ado speci@@ fies .
Di@@ ane K@@ ru@@ ger is also worth it
L &apos;@@ Or@@ é@@ al Paris has just added a new name to its en@@ viable list of amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors : Di@@ ane K@@ ru@@ ger .
Starting next year , the German act@@ ress will become the image of the brand &apos;s different products , singing the universal s@@ logan &apos; Because I &apos;m worth it . &apos;
The star of &apos; Jo@@ y@@ eux No@@ ë@@ l &apos; , one of the finest act@@ res@@ ses on the international scene , jo@@ ins other celeb@@ ri@@ ties signed to L &apos;@@ O@@ real Paris , like Lin@@ da Evangel@@ ista , Jan@@ e Fon@@ da , An@@ die Mac@@ D@@ ow@@ ell , E@@ va Long@@ oria and the Spani@@ ard Pen@@ el@@ ope Cruz .
Before her , the last ones to enter such an elite club were the act@@ res@@ ses Evangel@@ ine L@@ il@@ ly ( &apos; Lo@@ st &apos; ) and Frei@@ da P@@ into ( &apos; S@@ l@@ um@@ dog Milli@@ on@@ aire &apos; ) .
For the men &apos;s line , the cosmetic brand also includes del@@ uxe amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors : Patrick D@@ emp@@ sey ( &apos; Gre@@ y &apos;s An@@ atom@@ y &apos; ) and Mat@@ the@@ w Fox ( Evangel@@ ine &apos;s co-@@ star on &apos; Lo@@ st &apos; ) .
The British Fas@@ hion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion .
Top representatives - designers and models , past and present -@@ gathered at the annual awards presentation , which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice .
Nob@@ ody missed the date .
The former model J@@ erry Hall &apos;@@ s@@ daughter , Georgia May Jag@@ ger , was chosen as Model of the Year .
Poker by Manuel Vic@@ ent
In &apos; Four A@@ ces &apos; ( Al@@ f@@ agu@@ ara , illustr@@ ations by Fern@@ ando Vic@@ ente ) Manuel Vic@@ ent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary life ( and , in some cases , the other one too ) .
He does not do it in predictable or terrible ways ( bi@@ ographi@@ cal sk@@ etch , life and work ) , rather by looking for something that spark@@ ed the creation of the character .
The trip has its exc@@ it@@ ements , and Vinc@@ ent us spar@@ es no scar@@ es or ill@@ um@@ inations .
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure , the book is a tou@@ ching invitation to be read and r@@ er@@ ead .
Here are some s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets .
On Albert Cam@@ us : &quot; In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn &apos;t a sea , rather a spiritual inst@@ inc@@ t , almost physical , the same one I felt without giving it a name : the pleasure against the ill-@@ f@@ ated , mor@@ ality without gu@@ ilt , and inno@@ c@@ ence without any go@@ d . &quot;
On Sam@@ uel B@@ eck@@ ett : &quot; Ni@@ hi@@ li@@ stic , alleg@@ or@@ ical Christian , he wrote what was in his blood , not in his int@@ ell@@ ect , between im@@ poten@@ ce and ignor@@ ance , with a da@@ zz@@ ling po@@ etic hum@@ or , meaning@@ less , like the bla@@ de of the kni@@ fe that was about to kill him . &quot;
On Gra@@ ham Gre@@ ene : &quot; Our man was ab@@ duc@@ ted by this woman with a passion that la@@ sted for thir@@ teen years , in which fl@@ esh combined the exc@@ itement of ad@@ ul@@ tery with the pleasure of re@@ mor@@ se , a spiritual privilege which consi@@ sted of reaching heav@@ en through the road of per@@ dition . &quot;
On James Jo@@ y@@ ce : &quot; &apos; U@@ ly@@ ss@@ es &apos; was published in Paris in 19@@ 22 by Sy@@ l@@ via Be@@ ach@@ .@@ This is one of the eigh@@ t-@@ thous@@ and-@@ meter peaks of world literature which must be sc@@ aled by the north face , which the best mountain clim@@ bers hur@@ l themselves off time and time again . &quot;
On William F@@ aul@@ k@@ ner : &quot; He was a wei@@ rd guy . &quot;
Of himself , he sometimes said that he was the h@@ eir to a land@@ owner in the county , and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a cro@@ codi@@ le .
&quot; They were both dreams of gran@@ de@@ ur . &quot;
On Lou@@ is@@ -F@@ er@@ din@@ and Cel@@ ine : &quot; This writer took the der@@ ang@@ ed scre@@ am cri@@ ed from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his ec@@ o , under his literary form , into the dep@@ ths of the night of the 20th century , and made it a journey , hi@@ ding from himself and calling on the past with a violent dis@@ course to the wor@@ ms . &quot;
On Dor@@ oth@@ y Par@@ ker : &quot; One day , she kne@@ eled and pra@@ yed : &apos; De@@ ar God , I be@@ g you to make me stop writing like a woman &apos; . &quot;
On Joseph Con@@ rad : &quot; On his tom@@ b were eng@@ ra@@ ved these ver@@ ses from Sp@@ enc@@ er : &apos; S@@ le@@ ep after to@@ il , / port after stor@@ my seas , / ease after war , / death after life does greatly please . &apos; &quot;
On Vir@@ g@@ inia Wolf : &quot; She also carried her de@@ pres@@ sions in her luggage .
The husband accepted it as normal when she told him that Ed@@ ward VII spi@@ ed on her from the az@@ al@@ eas and that the birds s@@ ang in Greek .
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neur@@ otic woman whose literary talent came before her ma@@ dness . &quot;
On Pi@@ o Baro@@ ja : &quot; What did Mar@@ tin@@ -S@@ an@@ tos do but try to in@@ oc@@ ulate Jo@@ y@@ ce in Baro@@ ja ?
What did Ben@@ et try but to pass Baro@@ ja through the weapons of F@@ aul@@ k@@ ner ?
What did C@@ ela do but ab@@ duc@@ t the gl@@ ory of that man so that it would serve his own ped@@ est@@ al ?
C@@ ow@@ ard@@ ly Ag@@ gres@@ sion
Last week , my 7@@ 0-@@ year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fu@@ en@@ lab@@ ra@@ da when a group of kids between 15 and 18 years old passed alongside her and our dog , a mix@@ ed-@@ bre@@ ed , rescu@@ ed from the po@@ und and weigh@@ ing no more than six ki@@ los , and , without saying a word , k@@ ic@@ ked the dog twice , leaving the dog badly injured .
Our indi@@ gn@@ ation knew no bo@@ unds because we don &apos;t see the fun in grat@@ uit@@ ous aggres@@ sion towards a small and defen@@ sel@@ ess animal , which by the way , was on a le@@ ash .
It must be added that it dist@@ res@@ sed the woman who was cal@@ mly taking a walk and who , when she re@@ prim@@ anded those individuals , came to fear for her safety , because a lun@@ atic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman , a child , an elderly person , and , certainly , to anyone weaker than himself .
The incident took place on a@@ Tuesday at five o &apos;@@ clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet neighborhood .
The dog was cr@@ ying all day .
By the way , we filed a complaint at a nearby police station which we doubt means much , not@@ to sti@@ r up trouble , just to clarify that the co@@ war@@ dly mur@@ der@@ ers were Spanish .
The ou@@ trage has led us to den@@ ounce this fact .
We don &apos;t understand what is happening when young people consider it fun to grat@@ uit@@ ously mist@@ re@@ at a defen@@ sel@@ ess animal which gives us love , compani@@ on@@ ship and friendship .
We don &apos;t know if there is any poli@@ ten@@ ess and respect for animals and people left .
Michel@@ in and Fes@@ vi@@ al united on the use of hel@@ m@@ ets
The ti@@ re manufacturer Michel@@ in , in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety ( Fes@@ vi@@ al ) , has launched a campaign to promote the use of hel@@ m@@ ets , especially among younger motor@@ ists , both organizations reported today .
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a hel@@ met , because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing head in@@ jur@@ ies and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motor@@ cycle .
Michel@@ in indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety which &quot; goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day , &quot; and added that it also contributes towards this goal by means of other educational and informative measures .
This new campaign promoting hel@@ met use in motor@@ cycles , under the motto &apos; To be or not to be , &apos; will initially distribute post@@ ers to more than 500 motor@@ cycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible .
Finally , Michel@@ in stressed that road safety &quot; is a constant concern &quot; for the company , as being a manufacturer of ti@@ res for two-@@ whe@@ eled vehicles , one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products .
Sales of light commercial vehicles on the increase
Almost two years later , the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel .
The 9,@@ 4@@ 25 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.@@ 6 % from 2008 , and , more importantly , indicates the first increase after 22 consec@@ utive months of decline , according to figures from the manufacturers association ( AN@@ FA@@ C ) and the vend@@ ors association ( G@@ AN@@ V@@ AM ) .
However , it &apos;s not time to start celebr@@ ating since the reference the comparison was made to -@@ November 200@@ 8@@ - was particularly bad , with a 60 % decrease from the previous year .
The outcome is that , regardless of last month &apos;s up@@ turn , the total number of regi@@ str@@ ations during those 11 months is 40 % below last year &apos;s .
Since January , 9@@ 5,@@ 8@@ 53 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hot@@ ch@@ pot@@ ch of light commercial vehicles were sold : derived v@@ ans , pick ups , v@@ ans , light v@@ ans and ligh@@ t-@@ ch@@ assis trucks .
At the same time , the storm clou@@ ds affecting demand have not completely clear@@ ed , so even though they are also purchased by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises , almost all of which pay through external funding .
As a result of the restrictions caused by closed t@@ ap bank loans , it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline .
In light of this , unlike cars , the aid of the 200@@ 0@@ E@@ purchase has done little .
A@@ side from individuals , provisions are made for the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceed@@ ing 160 gram@@ s per kilom@@ eter , but the number of transactions has been in@@ significant .
Just yesterday , the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles , and also to commercial ver@@ hi@@ cles ( trucks and buses ) , was brought to mind by G@@ AN@@ V@@ AM .
The s@@ ellers &apos; association predic@@ ts that 2010 will be similar to the year coming to a close , which estimates a 19 % drop in sales ( passenger cars and 4@@ x@@ 4@@ s ) .
Support for emergency bra@@ king is already obligatory
Support systems to emergency bra@@ kes will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars , just as it happened with anti-@@ lock breaks ( AB@@ S ) and will happen with stability control ( ES@@ P )
In fact , they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011 .
The measure , imposed by the European Union , aims to increase pedestrian safety ; however , how they work can also help prevent many re@@ ar-@@ end col@@ li@@ sions .
What the emergency bra@@ ke assi@@ stant does is increase the pressure on the bra@@ kes in the event of an emergency , which the system det@@ ects through the driver &apos;s pressure on the ped@@ al .
But this doesn &apos;t always maintain that pressure through to the end .
According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer , Bo@@ sch , a third of drivers involved in an accident had not step@@ ped on the bra@@ ke before a col@@ li@@ sion and half of them didn &apos;t apply the full force .
Up to 1,@@ 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid , however , calls for the full bra@@ king system , reducing the distance the car needs to stop .
According to an EU study , if all cars were equipped with this feature , 1,@@ 100 fat@@ al accidents involving pedestri@@ ans could be avoided a year .
The reduction will be even bigger -@@ it estimates that one in four accidents inj@@ uring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency bra@@ king systems become popular .
In this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system which ( via ra@@ dar or a camera ) det@@ ects obstacles and war@@ ns the driver , in addition to ligh@@ tly applying the bra@@ kes .
If the driver re@@ acts , he helps it by increasing the pressure on the ped@@ al if it is necessary .
If he does not react , and even though the col@@ li@@ sion is un@@ avo@@ idable , the device exer@@ ts the maximum force to the bra@@ kes to minim@@ ize damage .
General Motors delays Op@@ el plan until January
While workers at the Op@@ el plant in Fig@@ u@@ er@@ u@@ el@@ as ( Zar@@ ago@@ za ) have already been informed by N@@ ick Rei@@ l@@ ly , the new president of General Motors ( GM ) Europe , that the production of the new M@@ eri@@ va will begin in the first week of April -@@ probably the 8@@ th@@ - as reported by J@@ avier Ort@@ ega , the U.S. manufacturer is cau@@ tioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for Op@@ el .
N@@ ick Rei@@ l@@ ly , the new president of GM Europe , wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the affected party .
And this may make the final document , which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be delayed until the beginning of 2010 .
On the other hand , GM is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of Sa@@ ab should be made in the next few days .
It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible .
GM ad@@ mits to having had contact with some potential new bu@@ yers .
One of them could be Ge@@ ely , which aims to acquire Vol@@ vo , but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Sk@@ yp@@ er , which is funded by the Russian group Conver@@ g , is gaining momentum .
In the event that none of them come to an agreement , GM would be able to sell some Sa@@ ab assets to the Chinese Ba@@ ic .
The decision to close Sa@@ ab at the end of the year if it is not sold still stands .
Dri@@ ving the Porsche Bo@@ x@@ ster Spy@@ der
To develop their latest and most precious gem , the Porsche engineers took the Bo@@ x@@ ster S as a base and succeeded in tri@@ mming it by no less than 80 ki@@ los , making the total weight a mere 1,@@ 2@@ 75 ki@@ los .
This led them to , first , cutting out the automatic roof , which has been sub@@ stituted by a manu@@ ally-@@ operated can@@ vas one , saving 21 ki@@ los ; using al@@ umin@@ um doors , like those on the GT@@ 3 , &apos; dro@@ pping &apos; another 15 , removing the climate control , 13 ; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 li@@ ters , earning 7 more ki@@ los ; mounting spor@@ ty bu@@ cket seats , another 12 , and with the 19@@ -@@ inch light@@ weight wheels , five .
Finally , for@@ eg@@ o@@ ing the CD@@ R-@@ 30 sound system brought it down another 6 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s , and changing the door hand@@ les to fabric ones cut the remaining k@@ il@@ o .
Even though it is also available with the PD@@ K du@@ al-@@ cl@@ ut@@ ch shift , the test was conducted on a unit with the six-@@ speed manual transmission , mainly on the back roads of California and along stret@@ ches of really win@@ dy mountain roads .
Its performance can only be described as f@@ law@@ less .
The reduction in weight does not imp@@ ly that the car doesn &apos;t gri@@ p the asp@@ halt .
Rather the complete opposite : it has been some time since we tested a model so small and light , which , in turn , transmitted so much confidence when corn@@ ering , even at high speeds .
It is a small ath@@ l@@ ete , able to warm up its mus@@ cles in a low gear for as long as we need , until ordered to sprin@@ t , to bra@@ ke , to recover and go back to explo@@ iting its engine ...
Just what we asked for . Thanks to its ste@@ ering , as communic@@ ative as it is precise , what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do .
And it will do it with sur@@ g@@ ical precision .
Op@@ tional engine noise
The sound of its V@@ 6 box@@ er with 3@@ 20 horse power ( 10 more than the Bo@@ x@@ ster S ) is well made and can be enh@@ anc@@ ed@@ with the &apos; sport &apos; option and through a system that modi@@ fies the ro@@ ar of the engine , which deb@@ uted earlier in the Pan@@ am@@ era .
The acceler@@ ation is brutal , either from a stand@@ still or recover@@ ing .
The suspension is firm but not harsh or un@@ comfortable .
The asp@@ halt of the high@@ ways we cross@@ ed with the Bo@@ x@@ ster Spy@@ der was fairly be@@ aten up , but the car handled the poth@@ ol@@ es well .
The electronic ai@@ ds hardly showed up on the course ; that is because , well into the morning , we found early morning ice and gra@@ vel on some cur@@ ves .
In short , it is an ul@@ tra light@@ weight car , one of the most fun to drive on the market , andi@@ s a bit more than just a simple modification of the Bo@@ x@@ ster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 , priced at 7@@ 0,@@ 9@@ 31 euros .

Bas@@ kon@@ ia gives away a victory in Israel
Ca@@ ja Labor@@ al achieved a stunning 8@@ 2-@@ 91 victory on their visit to the M@@ acc@@ ab@@ ee Elec@@ tra court despite D@@ us@@ ko I@@ van@@ ovi@@ c &apos;s team &apos;s heavy losses , and after the great performance by Mi@@ z@@ ra Tel@@ to@@ vic , who was the best on his team with eight three-@@ po@@ inters sc@@ ored ( 29 points ) , they now at the top of their group .
The Vit@@ orian team knew to make up for the significant ab@@ sen@@ ces of Herr@@ mann , O@@ les@@ on , Hu@@ ert@@ as and Mic@@ ov with a big dose of involvement and team work , even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory .
Additionally , their huge success from the si@@ delines , with 16 three po@@ inters sc@@ ored , had a lot to do with the final tri@@ umph .
The game started out in favor of the A@@ zul@@ gran@@ as , who put themselves ahead on the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard from the start .
As Vit@@ ora &apos;s first four bas@@ k@@ ets were from the per@@ im@@ eter , the speculation was already that they had j@@ ump@@ ed into the Israeli net with hot w@@ ri@@ sts .
English and Tel@@ et@@ ovi@@ c were the main sc@@ or@@ ers of the 18-@@ 20 at the end of the first period .
The second quarter was more of the same , but the Ala@@ van team op@@ ted for the inside game of Bar@@ ac and the work of Eli@@ y@@ ah@@ u , who was gre@@ eted with whi@@ st@@ les and appl@@ ause at his return home , to continue increasing their lead by half-@@ time ( 3@@ 4-@@ 43 ) .
Tel@@ et@@ ovi@@ c had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points , even though Sp@@ lit@@ ter &apos;s &quot; six fewer &quot; points already sign@@ aled that it wasn &apos;t going to be the best night for the Brazilian .
But the game , despite being headed for half time , was not more deci@@ de@@ d@@ and the M@@ acc@@ ab@@ ees tried to remind the Vit@@ ori@@ ans that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the &apos; hand of Eli@@ as &apos; putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .
E@@ id@@ son and P@@ n@@ ini played a decisive role in the &quot; y@@ el@@ lows &apos; &quot; return to the light .
More dis@@ advantages
I@@ van@@ ovi@@ c &apos;s players , injured but far from dead , needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could brea@@ the , and that &apos;s when the machine gun Mar@@ za Tel@@ et@@ ovi@@ c arrived , with three almost consec@@ utive three-@@ po@@ inters and the help of English and Ri@@ bas , he brought the sc@@ or@@ ebo@@ ard back to a re@@ ass@@ uring lead ( 5@@ 4-@@ 67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 5@@ 7-@@ 67 ) .
The A@@ lav@@ as worked themselves to the bone in the last period , and English and San E@@ met@@ eri@@ o ( 6@@ 5-@@ 75 ) had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes .
However , P@@ n@@ ini and E@@ id@@ son , the best on their team , did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-@@ point line ( 7@@ 0-@@ 77 ) .
In spite of this , and with Sp@@ lit@@ ter f@@ ou@@ ling out , I@@ v@@ onic &apos;s team didn &apos;t r@@ ush , defended well , and , even though the Israelis came close at the last minute , the game ws already won and victory escap@@ ed Tel Avi@@ v for the first time in the season .
In@@ jur@@ ies im@@ pe@@ de Uni@@ ca@@ ja &apos;s fight
Uni@@ ca@@ ja lost mis@@ er@@ ably in Greece against the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os and gave them the lead in Group B of the Eur@@ ole@@ ague in a game marked by the loss of the ca@@ j@@ ist@@ as , especially in the inside game ( Fre@@ eland , Lim@@ a and Archi@@ bald ) which facilit@@ ated the Greek victory .
The Malaga team was not co@@ w@@ ed by the atmosphere in the Peace and Fri@@ end@@ ship Stadium , nor by the excellence of its ri@@ val , maybe the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget .
The playing exhi@@ bited in the first quarter allowed the Andalu@@ si@@ ans to take it eas@@ y@@ .@@ An aggressive defense and three consec@@ utive three-@@ po@@ inters , two from the point guard Om@@ ar C@@ ook , and one from Gu@@ il@@ lem Gu@@ bi@@ o , b@@ aff@@ led the home team 12-@@ 18 , minute 9 .
The Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os were obviously surprised by Uni@@ ca@@ ja &apos;s intensity , even though the home team &apos;s ar@@ senal in the inside game with Bour@@ ou@@ sis , V@@ u@@ j@@ c@@ ic and Sch@@ or@@ ts@@ ani@@ tis brought them back to 2@@ 2-@@ 20 , in the 13th minute , at which point an attempted fight between the two U.S. point gu@@ ards , Be@@ ver@@ ley and Willi@@ ams , resulted in the dis@@ qualification of both players .
The Greek team started showing their sup@@ eri@@ ority inside both zones , where the loss of English center Jo@@ el Fre@@ eland to injury and three personal f@@ ou@@ ls by Carlos Jim@@ en@@ ez ham@@ pered the ca@@ j@@ ist@@ as .
Between them the inside players and the Lithu@@ anian forward , Lin@@ as Lei@@ z@@ as , with their three-@@ po@@ inters , increased the lead to 4@@ 4-@@ 32 in the 19th minute .
An impossible com@@ eb@@ ack
The third period was very offensive for the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os , who , despite 19 losses , proved superior and began to even out the difference in the game in Malaga , making it 6@@ 6-@@ 48 in the 27@@ th minute , which sh@@ ook the group leader .
Uni@@ ca@@ ja tried to overcome their ab@@ sen@@ ces and the latest withdrawal of the Scottish center , Robert Archi@@ bald , who was injured during the game .
Despite all the problems , because of C@@ ook &apos;s control and three-@@ po@@ inters , and Le@@ wis &apos; assi@@ sts , Uni@@ ca@@ ja had some hope left with the score at 6@@ 6-@@ 57 in the 3@@ 1st minute .
But it was practically impossible because the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os , when pressed and given their sup@@ eri@@ ority , seemed un@@ stopp@@ able once cen@@ tim@@ eters inside the zone .
The Croatian center , Nikol@@ a V@@ u@@ j@@ c@@ ic , managed to bring back the bas@@ ket average to 8@@ 1-@@ 62 in the 3@@ 7th minute and Uni@@ ca@@ ja gave up , hand@@ ing the top-@@ seed over to the Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os .

In the week that the application was launched , the search engine had detected that in general , the Spanish worker &quot; feels under@@ paid , &quot; said the Tro@@ v@@ it Product Manager , Albert Ri@@ ber@@ a .
According to the data Tro@@ v@@ it uses from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France , the Spanish are the lowest paid .
A British programm@@ er charges 4@@ 5,@@ 2@@ 26 euros gross per year , and a French one 3@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 59 , as opposed to the 24@@ ,000 a Spani@@ ard receives .
Similarly , a driver receives an annual net pay of 3@@ 4,@@ 24@@ 7 euros in England , 25@@ ,@@ 7@@ 51 in France , and 16@@ ,@@ 4@@ 20 in Spain .
According to Tro@@ v@@ it , the lowest paid job in Spain is wa@@ iter , with annual net earnings of 1@@ 1,@@ 5@@ 92 euros ; followed by sal@@ es@@ person , with 14@@ ,@@ 7@@ 25 euros , and operator , with 15@@ ,@@ 6@@ 67 euros .
The most search@@ ed-@@ for jobs on the net in the past three months are drivers , part-@@ time jobs and social worker .
Brazil sets a release date for Z@@ el@@ aya
The Brazilian Government has put a deadline on Manuel Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s stay in the emb@@ ass@@ y in T@@ egu@@ ci@@ g@@ alp@@ a .
The de@@ posed president must leave the emb@@ ass@@ y by the 27@@ th of January , 2010 at the latest , when his mandate officially ends .
Francisco Cat@@ und@@ a , the char@@ g@@ é d ’ aff@@ aires of the Brazilian Em@@ bass@@ y in the Hon@@ dur@@ an capital , told TV Glob@@ o that &quot; M@@ el &quot; knows that he must leave the emb@@ ass@@ y , where he has been a refugee since 21st September , before that date .
&quot; He is aware that he has to leave on January 27@@ th , the end of his term ; he has to look for another occupation . &quot;
The station also quoted the former president , who confirmed his intention to leave the emb@@ ass@@ y before the deadline : &quot; My plan is to leave as soon as possible , obviously with the support of the Brazilian government , &quot; Z@@ el@@ aya said via telephone .
Following the November 29@@ th elections ( in which Pro@@ fir@@ o Lob@@ o was elected ) , Z@@ el@@ aya said that he would remain in the emb@@ ass@@ y until January .
However , this very week , he tried to find refuge in Brazil .
The operation finally ended un@@ successfully with the rejection of Z@@ el@@ aya &apos;s political refugee status , which the Government headed by Rober@@ to Michel@@ etti tried to impose &quot; de facto &quot; .
Thanks a lot
After days of wine and ro@@ ses from last spring , when inflation was the prev@@ ailing trend on the markets , uncertainty again re@@ ars its ug@@ ly head , which is not surprising since it is their natural state , in an environment in which agents make decisions about the naturally uncertain future .
The cure prescri@@ bed by the central banks to stabili@@ ze the markets was to mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly give an open bar liquidity at clo@@ se@@ -to-@@ zero rates so that the financial institutions would buy de@@ duc@@ tible assets .
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and , without ques@@ tioning their un@@ orthodo@@ x liquidity policy , are beginning to throw a sp@@ anner in the works as the ECB makes its y@@ early auction next week .
Therefore , investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such un@@ orthodo@@ x measures , and we are seeing a re@@ versal of the reduction in risk premi@@ ums .
The vol@@ atility of the stock markets and the corporate bond spre@@ ads have swif@@ tly picked up again , even though they are far behind the extreme levels that they reached at the beginning of the year .
The states were oblig@@ ated to soci@@ alize private risk , and again public debt is going to be affected .
Again there is a flight for quality and the U.S. , Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors , causing a@@ wider spread of the Eurozone countries in respect to Germany .
Spain hardly seems to have been affected by this period of instability , but that &apos;s when Standard and Po@@ or &apos;s arrived and threatened a new revision , down@@ gra@@ ding the Kingdom of Spain .
Furthermore , some uncertainty doesn &apos;t h@@ urt to silence defen@@ ders of moral haz@@ ard , who again tried to raise awareness of those responsible for the global economic policy by having stopped the destructive effects derived from credit restrictions on the loss of jobs , when what should be done is to declare a new Th@@ an@@ ks@@ giving Day .
However , Dubai &apos;s pain@@ ts with a tri@@ bal fight between the em@@ irs to restore power in the em@@ ir@@ ates , and we &apos;ve already seen it before in Greece .
A Government which hi@@ des the public deficit , elections and a new Government that pul@@ ls up the rug .
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi , and S@@ oc@@ rates in Portugal after Barroso .
It doesn &apos;t make sense that Eco@@ fin saved Hung@@ ry from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year , and th@@ ati@@ t is going to let a euro m@@ ember@@ -@@ country fail to fulfill its commitments .
What is logical is that Eco@@ fin has forced the Greek government to be transparent , and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
If , as we hope , we find ourselves before a standardi@@ zed period of transi@@ ent risk premi@@ ums , after some excess of le@@ ver@@ aged positions , it would be within our expectations .
In the case of Spain , since our public debt is spreading like the European corporate bonds , we should not be worried .
If the European spre@@ ads decrease and ours continue to expand , then it would be an idi@@ o@@ syn@@ c@@ ratic risk for Spain .
That of Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s is an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te . When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to anticip@@ ate its recovery scenarios and to re@@ vise up its scenario for 2011 , including the OECD and the European Commission , they return to the fra@@ y with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy , and long life expect@@ ancy does not port@@ end its warning .
Again , it has all the ear@@ marks to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets , but for now , &quot; pru@@ dence , my driver . &quot;

The Iber@@ dro@@ la Chairman , Ign@@ acio San@@ che@@ z Gal@@ an , was the first to speak yesterday before the sub@@ committee of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where Spain &apos;s energy strategy for the next two decades is currently being debated .
After his speech , which was followed by the president of Gas Natur@@ al-@@ F@@ en@@ o@@ sa , Raf@@ ael Vil@@ las@@ ec@@ a , Gal@@ an gave the press a few gli@@ mp@@ ses of what was planned in the sub@@ committee behind closed doors .
For the president of Iber@@ dro@@ la , Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 20@@ 30 , while they keep operating the nuclear power plants which are pres@@ ently open .
Otherwise , the investments required will not be 60 billion , but up to 95 billion .
Yes , Iber@@ dro@@ la believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on increasing its generating capacity , but on distribution networks and on international inter@@ connections .
From 2020 on , the matter changes and the power will have to increase .
His bet is in both coal plants with@@ carbon dioxide cat@@ chers and , especially , renewable sources of energy .
In this case , he considers that it takes 18@@ ,000 new M@@ W , and that is with &quot; support energy . &quot;
Though he believes that the Sustain@@ able Economy Act , which the government has just approved , is in line with what his company has been calling for , Gal@@ an would not draw blood with a royal decre@@ e to promote the consumption of domestic coal , which contradi@@ cts the policies to combat climate change .
In his opinion , there is &quot; a clear , long-term gam@@ ble &quot; in this sense , despite the &quot; sure &quot; measures , as the Chairman of Iber@@ dro@@ la calls them .
As it is , Gal@@ an believes that the decisions to invest , even though they are long-term , should start to be made since it has already taken a long time to think them through , and a stable framework for addressing remuner@@ ation is necessary .
Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al wins the &apos; handling &apos; of A@@ er L@@ ing@@ us in ten airports
Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al &apos;s airport ground services subsidiary , Swiss Swis@@ sport , is going to be the Irish airline A@@ er L@@ ing@@ us &apos; preferred partner for cargo services in ten of the European airports where it operates .
Paris , London , Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most prominent .
The agreement , which has not tran@@ sc@@ ended economic terms , will last for five years .
Moreover , Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al , the autonomous government of Cas@@ ti@@ le-@@ La Man@@ cha , and the University of Al@@ cal@@ a de Hen@@ ares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create a Center for the Innovation of Intelli@@ gent Infra@@ structure .
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million by 2012 , 50 % of which comes from Fer@@ ro@@ vi@@ al .
One of the center &apos;@@ st@@ asks will be to research energy efficiency on high@@ ways and in airports .
Ac@@ ci@@ ona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hot@@ chief and Bou@@ y@@ gues .
Ac@@ ci@@ ona is stru@@ ggling for its first highway conc@@ ession in Australia , a market where it already operates as a an energy and water company .
The construction involves a 1.@@ 7 billion Australian dollar tunnel ( about 1.@@ 0@@ 47 billion euros ) .
The French Bou@@ y@@ gues and German Hot@@ chief are its ri@@ vals .
A 5-@@ km tunnel in the Australian city of B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e , on the east coast , has become the closest chance for Ac@@ cion@@ ato settle in the country@@ as a construction and motorway company .
The city council wants to have it completed by the end of 2014 .
After op@@ ting for the public-@@ private partnership ( the ac@@ ron@@ ym PP@@ P in English ) to move the project forward , in a business plan under the tut@@ el@@ age of Ernst &amp; Young , the administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll .
Depending on the bi@@ ds submitted by next May , the planned investment comes to 1.@@ 7 billion Australian dollars ( 1.@@ 0@@ 47 billion euros ) and three con@@ sor@@ tia , with a remarkable predomin@@ ance of European construction firms , are competing in the final stage .
The group known as Tran@@ sc@@ ity , is headed by Ac@@ ci@@ ona , the only Spanish one in the competition , and its partners are BM@@ D and Gh@@ ella .
The first is a major Australian construction company , while the second , based in Italy , is one of Europe &apos;s leading specialists in under@@ ground@@ construc@@ tions .
The Northern District con@@ sortium is p@@ itted against Ac@@ ci@@ ona &apos;s team , with the presence of Britain &apos;s La@@ ing O &apos;@@ R@@ our@@ ke , the Australian infrastructure group Trans@@ field , and the French construction group Bou@@ y@@ gues .
The third and final con@@ sortium to make it through the selection process is called L@@ BR@@ J@@ V , where Australia &apos;s Lei@@ gh@@ ton ( a subsidiary of the German construction company Hoch@@ tief , owned in turn by AC@@ S ) , domestic Bau@@ l@@ der@@ stone ( owned by the German group Bil@@ finger Ber@@ ger ) and R@@ az@@ el , the Gal@@ lic firm speci@@ alizing in civil construction , split the capital .
The Australian infrastructures market promises big jobs and privati@@ zation , but it carries a clear star@@ t-@@ up difficulty if it &apos;s not le@@ aning towards hi@@ ring a local construction company .
It is one strategy that the afor@@ ementioned Hoch@@ tief and Bil@@ finger , in addition to Asian shareholders , have pursued , and one that remains un@@ resolved for the Spanish gi@@ ants in the industry .
AC@@ S barely acquired a position in that market through its 30 % stake in Hoch@@ tief , the@@ propri@@ et@@ or of the afor@@ ementioned Lei@@ gh@@ ton .
Asset milli@@ on@@ aires
Ac@@ ci@@ ona is bi@@ d@@ ding on a geographical location of the utmost importance for the sector , which already has a strong presence from its activity as an energy provider and the des@@ al@@ ination business .
Among other assets , it has the largest wind farm , W@@ au@@ bra Wind Farm ( 19@@ 2 M@@ W ) in Victoria , and leads the corporate gro@@ u@@ pres@@ pon@@ sible for building and managing the des@@ al@@ ination plant in Adel@@ ai@@ da with a budget of 700 million .
Now it intends to consolidate these two areas and exploit syn@@ ergies in the fields of construction and infrastructure operations .
The underground toll road , sponsor@@ ed by the B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Department of Infra@@ structure and the Northern Link , is cal@@ le@@ dup@@ on to connect the To@@ ow@@ ong Western High@@ way with the b@@ yp@@ ass in Kel@@ vin Gro@@ ve ( see map ) through the 5-@@ kilom@@ eter t@@ unn@@ el@@ .@@ It is a major endeav@@ or to reduce the traffic in B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e .
The timetable set by the administration sets the deadline for the decision in the summer of 2010 and for the work to start in December of next year .
Although this toll road would be open for traffic in the closing months of 2014 , the work is not anticipated to be completed until 20@@ 16 .
The tunnel began to take shape in 2005 .
It will include two lan@@ es in each direction , an electric toll system and a sophisticated venti@@ lation system .
The Que@@ ens@@ land government will provide 500 million dollars ( 30@@ 8 million euros ) for funding .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e is already offering business to Hoch@@ tief .
Australia continues to provide remarkable commodities to Hoch@@ tief , which announced its receipt of a Government contract worth 15@@ 4 million yesterday .
The firm , owned in-@@ part by AC@@ S , will set up the national broadband infrastructure with fi@@ ber op@@ tic c@@ ables through its local subsidiary , Lei@@ gh@@ ton .
This will provide high-speed internet access to 400@@ ,000 people and will provide work for the German firm for 18 months .
Moreover , the company has transferred the project to build the 2@@ 7-@@ story high King George Tower in the Australian city of B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e.@@ The work has yet to begin , and Hoch@@ tief has closed the sale for 12@@ 9 million .
Pres@@ ently , in the U.@@ K. , more specifically in Manchester , La@@ ing O &apos;@@ R@@ our@@ ke will par@@ take in the construction and operation of two schools over 25 years .
The initial investment will total 75 million euros .
F@@ CC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
F@@ CC , through its subsidiary Alpine , has been awarded the construction of a 2.@@ 1-@@ kilomet@@ er-@@ long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for 6@@ 4.@@ 5 million euros .
The firm received this contract days after getting Bos@@ ru@@ ck &apos;s ( Austria ) tunnel expansion job .
By doing this , Alpine is strengthening its expertise in tunnel construction .
The construction is planned to start in the beginning of 2010 , and the project tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame will span 32 months .
S@@ ra . Rus@@ h@@ more is awarded Ren@@ fe &apos;s advertising
Ren@@ fe has appropri@@ ated approximately three million euros annually for the advertising and marketing services of the S@@ ra . Rus@@ h@@ more agency for the next two years , the railway operator reported .
The contract covers the possibility of two 12-@@ month exten@@ sions@@ .@@ S@@ ra@@ . Rus@@ h@@ more has been chosen from the 16 agencies that entered the tender launched by Ren@@ fe , of which there were four fin@@ alists ; among them was T@@ B@@ W@@ A , which was in charge of cre@@ atives for the past 3 years .
From this point forward , S@@ ra . Rus@@ h@@ more will be in charge of campaign design and production .
France Telec@@ om fined 63 million for blocking competitors
The competition regul@@ ator in France has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Telec@@ om for anti-@@ competitive behavior in the country &apos;s Caribbean regions .
According to the institution , the operator limited land@@ line and mobile phone competition by signing exclusive agreements , service plans , and loy@@ alty programs with consumers out@@ side@@ of regulation .
With this sanc@@ tion , the former French monopoly and state-@@ owned company has accum@@ ulated more than 5@@ 60 million euros in fines since hin@@ dering its competitors in 1994 .
The penalty imposed yesterday has , in fact , increased because the authority that over@@ sees the competition believes France Telec@@ om has committed similar violations in the past and , therefore , is a repeat off@@ ender .
Application shop
On the other hand , the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the foot@@ steps of other operators , and has opened an on-line application shop , with the aim of increasing revenues outside of telecommunications .
At first , the Orange Application Shop will be active in France and the U.@@ K.
It will not reach other countries , including Spain , until 2010 .
Pla@@ ying the Champ@@ ions League has yiel@@ ded 4@@ 7@@ 6.@@ 4 million to Madrid and Barcelona since it was first established
The Champ@@ ions League has become a source of income for clubs since it started in 1992 .
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have collected 4@@ 7@@ 6.@@ 4 million , making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition .
The head of the list is Manchester United .
The head of the list is Manchester United .
W@@ inning the U@@ EFA Champ@@ ions League doesn &apos;t just earn you gl@@ or@@ y@@ .@@ It is also a major source of income for the big clubs .
So much so that U@@ EFA figures show that the competition has dealt out 5,@@ 36@@ 2.5 million euros to the 105 teams ( 12 of them from Spain ) who have participated in the event since the tournament was founded in the 1992 / 1993 season .
Real Madrid and F@@ .@@ C. Barcelona have far@@ ed well in this distribution .
The white club has been the third on the continent to have po@@ ck@@ eted more money from participating , and the only one , after AC Milan , to have won the tro@@ phy three times .
The Catal@@ an team , the defending champion and last winner of the de@@ func@@ t European Cup in 1992 , is fifth in the rank@@ ings .
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Much , two teams that have also made more money by participating in the Champ@@ ions League .
And that is in spite of both of them losing against Barcelona .
What more , Spain is only the third country to have made more money through the Champ@@ ions League despite having earned more titles than any other country ( five , compared to Italy &apos;s four , England &apos;s three , and Germany &apos;s two ) .
Distribution
This apparent parad@@ ox is explained by the complicated payment system the U@@ EFA uses .
For this fiscal year the body ch@@ ai@@ red by Michel Plat@@ ini expects to collect 1.@@ 0@@ 90 billion for the Champ@@ ions League .
The U@@ EFA dedic@@ ates 4@@ 13.@@ 1 million of that money to pay fixed rates : each of the 20 clubs participating in the pre@@ quali@@ fying round ( including At@@ le@@ tico Madrid ) receives 2.1 million .
Additionally , those who managed to participate received 3.@@ 8 million just for being there , in addition to another 5@@ 50@@ ,000 euros for every game they play .
There are also bon@@ uses for winning ( 800@@ ,000 euros ) and for ties ( 400@@ ,000 for each team ) .The oc@@ ta@@ -@@ fin@@ alists receive three million each ; the eight quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ alists , 3.@@ 3 million .
The last four will po@@ cket 4 million each .
The champion will win 9 million , ver@@ sus the 5.@@ 2 million for the run@@ n@@ er-@@ up .
So , with the idea of the fixed rates , a club takes home at least 7.@@ 1 million , and at most 3@@ 1.2 million .
Barcelona on the other hand po@@ ck@@ eted 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August .
But there are other varying payments to which 33@@ 7.@@ 8 million are allocated .
This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market .
Spain is the leader with four places allocated .
Last year &apos;s champion got 40 % of the allocated money , 30 % for second place , 20 % for third , 10 % for fourth .
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played this year .
Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa offers 61 million euros for 2@@ 9.@@ 9 % of S@@ os
Yesterday , the Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa holding company si@@ fted through the details of the bid on shares which led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25 % and 2@@ 9.@@ 9 % in S@@ os .
It is a percentage which doesn &apos;t require them to launch a tak@@ eover bid ( O@@ PA ) for all of the securities .
Speci@@ fically , Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa is offering 1.@@ 50@@ 25 eur@@ o@@ sp@@ er share , to be distributed over 10 years , and with a 1 % annual interest rate .
S@@ os shares closed yesterday at 1.@@ 85 euros ; so , Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa &apos;s offer under@@ valued the company 18 % below the market value .
According to Nu@@ eva Rum@@ asa , the price of 1.@@ 50 euros reflects the real value of S@@ os .
The offer is subject to the decision of eight of the 15 advis@@ ers .
The Jer@@ ez@@ ano group is giving a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling securities .
The CN@@ M@@ V assured that it had not been informed of the offer , despite Ru@@ iz Mat@@ e@@ os &apos; company saying that it had cont@@ acted a regul@@ ator .
If this comes to fru@@ ition , the pay@@ out would reach 6@@ 11.@@ 7 million when the cap@@ itali@@ zation of S@@ os is at 25@@ 4.@@ 27 million .
Meanwhile , S@@ os is restructuring its management .
In an attempt to stay out of possible tak@@ eover bi@@ ds and the legal v@@ ag@@ aries of its former managers , the brothers Jesus and Ja@@ ime Sal@@ az@@ ar , it announced the election of Maria Lu@@ is@@ a Jord@@ ana as the director of the internal audit .
It is a decision which makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company .
This is a newly created position which reports directly to the president of the group .
And not without contro@@ vers@@ y , as the company is still immer@@ sed in the legal battle for the alleged di@@ version of over 230 million from S@@ os to the Sal@@ az@@ ar brothers &apos; holding company .
In fact , it &apos;s possible that S@@ os will reveal further di@@ versions of funds in the next few months .
In regards to the Sal@@ az@@ ars &apos; credit , the former advis@@ ers Il@@ def@@ on@@ so Ort@@ ega and Ang@@ el Fern@@ an@@ dez N@@ ori@@ ega ( representatives of CC@@ M and Uni@@ ca@@ ja ) t@@ esti@@ fied and affir@@ med that they approved of the di@@ version of 2@@ 12 million without knowing where the money was going .
CN@@ M@@ V authorized the exclusion tak@@ e-@@ over bid submitted by In@@ ver@@ sor@@ a M@@ er
Yesterday , the National Sec@@ urities Market Commission ( CN@@ M@@ V ) approved of the exclusion tak@@ e-@@ over bid of Feder@@ ico Pat@@ ern@@ ina by In@@ ver@@ sor@@ a M@@ er , which was presented last October 9th .
The supervisory agency explained that this operation is authorized after it is understood that its terms adjust to existing standards and that the information pack@@ et &apos;s contents , submitted after the amendments introduced last December 2nd , are considered sufficient .
The CN@@ M@@ V has stated that the offer addresses the purchase of 5@@ 50@@ ,@@ 00@@ 8 shares of Feder@@ ico Pat@@ ern@@ ina at 7.@@ 65 euros a share , representing 8.@@ 95 % of its share capital , which consists of 6,@@ 14@@ 2,@@ 7@@ 86 shares that are tra@@ ded on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bil@@ ba@@ o .
It also explained that it has frozen 5,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 2,@@ 7@@ 78 million shares , which will not be tra@@ ded in any way until the completion of the offer , which specified the price determined by Fre@@ der@@ ico Pat@@ ern@@ ina in accordance with current regulations .
New tools for insp@@ ecting cars
In these days of stor@@ ms and accidents , it is not only gar@@ ages that are making a profit .
Every day , thousands of cars that have been in accidents are tow@@ ed to a garage , where a techni@@ cian must evaluate the damage and what the repair will cost .
No claim is the same , and calcul@@ ating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and complicated task .
Man@@ ually calcul@@ ating the cost of a repair between 20@@ ,000 and 30@@ ,000 euros , including parts and labor , may take two or three hours .
However , with the help of the most recent computer tools , it would take a matter of minutes .
This is why almost 100 % of techni@@ cians are using this kind of system .
Provi@@ ders of services , claims solutions , and maintenance are working to comp@@ ile data supplied by manufacturers , and then process it and offer it to customers as a useful tool .
In Spain , Au@@ dat@@ ex , of the North American Gro@@ up@@ o Sol@@ era , is the industry leader ; 80 % of assessments are done using their products .
The other firms in the sector , competing in the field of data assessment and processing , are G@@ t@@ Mo@@ tive and Eur@@ ot@@ ax .
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple .
According to E@@ du@@ ardo Vel@@ az@@ qu@@ ez , the Au@@ dat@@ ex business manager , 63 manufacturers and impor@@ ters are working in Spain , and each of them sub@@ mits data in a different format .
Furthermore , the amount of data to process is increasing to the point where they have released more versions , vari@@ ants and engines in the last five years than in the previous 15 .
When a new car h@@ its the market , these companies get to work .
It &apos;s very ar@@ du@@ ous work because you have to catalog each of the thousands of vehicle parts and@@ enter in your price .
In addition , a &quot; smart &quot; graphic is made for each model , where you can &quot; click &quot; on different parts of the car .
If it is a mass@@ -@@ market model , the work can be ready in a week , provided the process goes quickly .
If it &apos;s an un@@ common car , it can take up to three or four mon@@ th@@ s.@@ Currently , Au@@ dat@@ ex provides comprehensive data for 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % of the cars sold in Spain .
Among the most exclusive models , information is available for a Porsche , but not a Ferrari or Lam@@ bor@@ gh@@ ini for example .
As for the number of cars in circulation , it is over 99 % .
In order to document and develop the databases , Au@@ dat@@ ex has eight centers sc@@ attered around the world ( Spain , France , Germany , USA , Brazil , Mexico , China and Japan ) , and each of these speci@@ alizes in a specific brand .
Its national headquarters is in Al@@ co@@ ben@@ das ( Madrid ) .
There , over a hundred techni@@ cians ( usually expert mechan@@ ics ) work with three computer screens at the same time .
Au@@ dat@@ ex inv@@ ests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases .
Every month , 2.5 million pieces of information are added , and clients receive updates every two days .
Develop@@ ing that huge flow of information lets them give these companies different applications and varied products .
The most common use focuses on maintenance and repair , but depending on the country , there are also tools to manage scra@@ p pieces and to calcul@@ ate the market and resi@@ dual value of a car .
The only company with a used car guide available in Spain is Eur@@ ot@@ ax .
Au@@ dat@@ ex doesn &apos;t offer one in our country , but it does in the United States .
In view of the products that Au@@ dat@@ ex offers , it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support available to professionals in this sector .
This company offers 10 different tools ; Au@@ da@@ Plus , being the flag@@ ship product , is the standard solution , designed to allow techni@@ cians to assess claims .
It includes cars , motor@@ cycles , and light and heavy industrial vehicles .
Besides the cost of parts , it includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts .
This tool charges according to the use , for each app@@ ra@@ is@@ al .
The highest cost is 5.@@ 75 euros for customers who rarely use it , 10 times a month at most .
Then , every insurance company that makes thousands of assessments negoti@@ ates their price with Au@@ dat@@ ex .
Other products , like Au@@ da@@ V@@ IN , facilitate the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment that it left the assembly line with , just from its vehicle identification number .
Au@@ da@@ Gl@@ ass focuses on the glass parts of a car , and Au@@ da@@ Sub@@ ast@@ as is an on-line service open to the professional sector which facilit@@ ates the bi@@ d@@ ding on vehicles cal@@ ss@@ ed as writ@@ e-@@ off@@ s .
Their statistics service is very useful for identifying trends , ge@@ o-@@ demographic analysis and knowing standard devi@@ ations of makes and models .
You can study , for example , how many models of a particular make have gone to a shop because of mal@@ functions or how many have been in serious accidents in a certain period .
G@@ t Mo@@ tive is the only Spanish company working to develop these kinds of tools .
It s@@ ells , among others , the G@@ T E@@ stim@@ ate , which is again designed for techni@@ cians and also provides digital images , access to parts and the manufacturer &apos;s official prices and times .
G@@ T Mo@@ tive is a G@@ rup@@ o EIN@@ SA company , which was founded in 1971 as a provider of automotive services and solutions for assessing damage , mal@@ functions and maintenance .
The G@@ T App@@ ra@@ is@@ al Guide is its historical reference product on the market .
They work with 24@@ ,000 users in gar@@ ages , 3,@@ 100 techni@@ cians and 53 insurance companies .
Its turnover has grown by 20 % per year over the past three years , and it brought in 10.@@ 8 million euros in 2008 .
Early last year , the globalization process started with the installation of an office in Paris .
Meanwhile , Au@@ dat@@ ex was founded in Germany in 1966 and set up shop in Spain in 1979 .
According to company sources , 62 % of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world , and the remaining 37 % in North and South Americ@@ a.@@ They work with more than 900 insurance companies and 33@@ ,000 shops , 3@@ ,000 of which are in Spain .
G@@ rup@@ o Sol@@ era &apos;s ( Au@@ dat@@ ex , Si@@ dex@@ a , Inform@@ ex AB@@ Z , Holl@@ ander and IM@@ S ) worldwide turnover will total 5@@ 57 million dollars , 3.@@ 3 % more than 2008 .

This app@@ ra@@ is@@ al and buying and selling service is directed exclusively at professionals in the sector , such as insurance companies , techni@@ cians , r@@ enting agencies , shops , scra@@ p yards , and professional s@@ ellers who must register before using it .

Its major markets include Spain , Greece , Poland and Turkey .
The site currently has more than 1,@@ 500 registered s@@ ellers and 4@@ ,000 techni@@ cians .

A shop &apos;s estimate in four steps
With the Au@@ da@@ T@@ aller tool , Au@@ dat@@ ex guarantees that the user gets an estimate in only 4 steps : identify the vehicle , look for the spare part , create an estimate and generate an estimate .
User friend@@ liness is an essential condition for these systems , especially to convincing older techni@@ cians , who , to varying degrees , are usually more reluc@@ tant to use new management techniques .
The database includes 1,@@ 0@@ 34 vehicles , 6@@ 66 of which are cars , 10@@ 9 spor@@ t-@@ utility vehicles , 137 motor@@ cycles , 78 v@@ ans and 44 trucks .
Naturally , a computer with an internet connection is needed to use it .
After identifying the model to be re@@ paired by its vehicle identification number , an effective graphic image of the model appears , and then the necessary part is selected .
The user can include variables such as the price of labor , sur@@ charges and discounts , and can then print the estimate for the client .
Au@@ da@@ T@@ aller is not an app@@ ra@@ is@@ al tool like Au@@ da@@ Plus , but rather a reference catalog .
The main difference is that the system aimed at gar@@ ages does not include labor time estimates .
The cost of using this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year , which the customer can finance .
Pres@@ ently , Au@@ dat@@ ex is working to make these images three-@@ dimensional .
This is an innovation mechan@@ ics are appro@@ ving of because it will enable you , for example , to select a door and turn it around to see the inside .
