Prague Stock Market falls to min@@ us by the end of the trading day
After a sharp drop in the morning , the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses .
Trans@@ actions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise ( Č@@ E@@ Z ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading .
The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday &apos;s trading , when it dropped by nearly six percent .
This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop .
The reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the American House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , which refused to support the plan for the stabili@@ zation of the financial sector there , has manifest@@ ed itself here as well .
Sto@@ cks fall in Asia
Sto@@ cks in the Asian markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday , even though the in@@ de@@ xes ultimately er@@ ased a part of the losses during the day .
The H@@ ang Sen@@ g Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange wrote off nearly four percent during the day , but later it er@@ ased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to roughly 2.5 percent .
The H@@ ang Sen@@ g China Enter@@ prises Index , which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the stock market in Hong Kong , dropped by 3.@@ 8 percent , in Shanghai the markets were closed .
Sto@@ cks on the market in Sydney lost more than five percent , but ultimately lower@@ ed their losses to 4.@@ 3 percent .
The stock exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.@@ 6 percent according to the local index .
&quot; The timing of the b@@ ail@@ out action in the USA is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world , &quot; re@@ marked the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board , Joseph Y@@ am .
Despite the fact that it is a part of China , Hong Kong determines its currency policy separately , that is , without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank .
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States .
American legislat@@ ors should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system , according to Australian Prime Minister Kev@@ in Ru@@ d@@ d .
Otherwise there rep@@ ut@@ edly lo@@ oms the threat that other countries will also feel the imp@@ acts .
American stock bloo@@ d@@ bath
On Monday the American House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives rejected the plan to support the financial system , into which up to 700 billion dollars ( nearly 12 billion Czech crow@@ ns ) was to be invested .
The legislat@@ ors thus ignored President George Bush &apos;s appeal for them to support the plan .
According to Bush , the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabili@@ ze the entire economy .
American stocks suffered a bloo@@ d@@ bath on Monday and the major stock in@@ de@@ xes registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years .
The D@@ ow Jones Index dropped by nearly seven percent , having registered a simil@@ ar@@ ly-@@ ran@@ ged fall the last time in 1987 .
The index had dropped even prior to the vote , but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House , the index went into free fall .
Congress yiel@@ ds : US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and George W. Bush &apos;s cab@@ inet have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system .
The vote on it will take place at the beginning of next week .
American legislat@@ ors made a break@@ through in their talks about the approval of a b@@ ail@@ out plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amoun@@ ting to 700 billion dollars ( approximately 12 billion crow@@ ns ) .
But all is not won yet .
That is , the members of congress have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it .
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives on Monday .
The chair of the Financial Services Committee , Bar@@ ney Frank , told R@@ eu@@ ters this on Sunday .
Sour@@ ces say that the sen@@ ate could evi@@ dently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the so@@ on@@ est .
Econom@@ ists say that the announcement that the b@@ ail@@ out plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor significant to the revi@@ val of financial markets .
After@@ ward , however , a &quot; so@@ ber@@ ing up &quot; will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice .
Pau@@ l@@ son : Plan must be effective
&quot; We &apos;ve made great progress .
We &apos;ve resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabili@@ zation of markets should look , &quot; Democ@@ rat N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si told Blo@@ om@@ berg .
According to her , the final vote could take place as early as Sunday .
Repres@@ ent@@ atives of the legislat@@ ors met with American Finance Minister Henry Pau@@ l@@ son Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form .
The fund is meant to purchase uns@@ ell@@ able mort@@ gage assets which are pul@@ ling financial companies down into heavy losses and are end@@ anger@@ ing the stability of the entire system .
&quot; We &apos;re on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market .
It &apos;s necessary to continue in the cur@@ ative plan , but I think we &apos;re there , &quot; Pau@@ l@@ son said .
A signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is significantly imp@@ acting the stock markets , which are dro@@ pping sharp@@ ly .
According to Nevada Democratic sen@@ ator Harry Rei@@ d , that is how that legislat@@ ors are trying to have Congress to reach a definitive agreement as early as on Sunday .
Nam@@ ely , by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets , which , given their time zones , are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday &apos;s trading .
In the meantime , however , it is not yet clear with any certainty when both cham@@ bers of the American Congress will vote on the bill , nor whether the negotiations will not become hin@@ dered by some problem .
The legislat@@ ors hope that it will be approved in the next few days .
However , the bill will still go through a series of changes .
The total amount designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts .
The initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible , as requested by president George Bush .
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount , in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later , the final 350 billion dollars , if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function .
Bush appreci@@ ates progress in negotiations
Though the president can veto this decision , Congress can over@@ ride his veto .
Even in spite of these changes , the essential idea of the program , to gain finances for the bu@@ y@@ out of bad mort@@ gage stocks , the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mort@@ g@@ ages , has remained int@@ act .
&quot; We &apos;ve drawn it all up .
The House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Sen@@ ate on Monday , &quot; said Republic@@ an sen@@ ator Ju@@ d@@ d Greg@@ g .
Even American president Bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations .
His speaker Tony Fr@@ at@@ to declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday &apos;s progress and appreciated the &quot; two-@@ party effort to stabili@@ ze our financial markets and save our economy &quot; .
Con@@ stra@@ ining golden par@@ ach@@ utes
The chairman of the Sen@@ ate Banking Committee , Christop@@ her D@@ od@@ d , the chief negoti@@ ator , said that the legislat@@ ors had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program , protection of the taxpayers against losses , closing of relief packages , and timing of the financial plan .
The new law is also meant to constra@@ in the &quot; golden par@@ ach@@ utes &quot; for the heads of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will over@@ see the fund .
The committee is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance .
&quot; We &apos;ve worked very hard on this and we &apos;ve made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans , &quot; Pau@@ l@@ son said .
The plan also includes assistance to home@@ owners who have problems making their payments .
The cab@@ inet should negotiate new payments for the mort@@ g@@ ages it bu@@ ys , with the aim of lower@@ ing the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their houses .
M@@ are@@ k : Psych@@ ological help
According to the chief econom@@ ist of Patri@@ a Finance , David M@@ are@@ k , the proposed plan is a good idea , but its realization will be very difficult .
&quot; And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be bought .
This will determine how the financial sector and the cab@@ inet will divide the losses amongst themselves , &quot; M@@ are@@ k told the server i@@ HN@@ ed@@ .@@ cz this week .
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant , according to M@@ are@@ k .
&quot; More important is for the members of congress to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible .
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time , &quot; M@@ are@@ k empha@@ sized .
R@@ az@@ or &apos;s edge battle : MP3 players v@@ s. cell phones .
Our advice on how to choose
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files , no MP3 player can make phone calls .
This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone .
In spite of this , there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player .
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner .
It is not likely that you will get a top-@@ of-the-@@ line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Max@@ im Tur@@ bul@@ en@@ c .
First of all such music products not available on L@@ Ps , but also , from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it .
However , if your shel@@ ves are crow@@ ded with art rock , jazz , or blu@@ es vin@@ yl records , you are likely at least dre@@ aming of a record player like that .
It &apos;s the same with music on trips , that is , com@@ pressed music , simply put , MP3 music .
There are price and qualitative categories here as well .
For some , it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crow@@ ns on an MP3 player , just as it is hard for P@@ ink F@@ loyd fan to accept twenty-@@ cro@@ wn head@@ phones from a market hall .
Two extrem@@ es , between which there is enough space for everyone .
The selection is broad .
Batter@@ y life also decides
Some top-@@ of-the-@@ line music players can do much more than merely play music , but also what most cell phones can &apos;t even do by chance .
No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone .
In addition to the primary functions , calling and tex@@ ting , it can play music and video , record both , contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navig@@ ate in some cases .
And when we take smart phones and communication devices , you have a small computer in your po@@ cket .
It &apos;s a small mi@@ racle , as there is no refriger@@ ator that knows how to gri@@ ll and no television can take pictures .
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings dis@@ advantages .
The more functions you use on your cell phone , the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the char@@ ger .
And playing music is one of the biggest energy gu@@ zz@@ lers .
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours , most of them much less .
In this way , music players ( particularly the sim@@ pl@@ est ones ) are much more efficient .
Which is why you should count on the fact that in@@ expensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours .
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that , to be on the safe side , get another char@@ ger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices .
You won &apos;t have this problem with MP3 players , even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge .
Another problem arises when recording music on the cell phone .
Unfortunately , only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connec@@ tor , and on top of that , not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software .
Of course , music can be recorded directly onto a memory card , but very few card readers can handle the mini@@ ature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adap@@ tor .
For the music players , with some exceptions ( iPod ) , you don &apos;t need any special software .
It &apos;s enough to fill the device with music using the USB from the computer .
Most cell phones and music players already create a music library by themselves , organized according to the artist &apos;s name , album title , gen@@ re , or , e.g. , user rating .
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory , similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both ( i@@ river , Samsung , Sony , C@@ ow@@ on , smart phones with an operating systems ) .
Music players easier to service , cell phones can do more
In choosing specific equipment , you should be interested above all in the life of the battery , the capacity of the memory , the quality and type of the audio output , and of course also the user-@@ friendly nature of the operation .
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while , perhaps in the tram , any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough .
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do .
You don &apos;t even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle .
The MP3 can handle all of them , and in fact , most of the music you will get will be in this very format .
It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it , the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in W@@ MA format .
L@@ ess common is the appearance of A@@ AC ( the format used by the Apple company and its iPo@@ ds ) .
Better cell phones , at the same time , enable the purchase of music on-line .
All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator ( or another provider ) using mobile Internet .
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell phone .
Unfortunately the offer@@ ings from the operators are pal@@ try and are usually limited to fast@@ -@@ growing radio h@@ its .
The prices are also not among the lowest .
It is generally assumed , however , that this very manner of music sales ( whether using G@@ SM , the Internet or wireless Internet ) will take over the music industry in the future .
Most people have their cell phone on them at all times .
Whenever you feel like listening to something , you can reach for your cell phone in your po@@ cket , while the MP3 player lies at home , forgotten .
However , it still depends on whether you always have head@@ phones or at least the wire hand@@ s-@@ free with you .
If not , you can utili@@ ze the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones , but only in a minimum of MP3 players .
But the greatest advantage of the music cell phones for many people is the price .
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crow@@ ns .
For three or four thousand crow@@ ns , you can get a very decent wal@@ k@@ man .
U@@ su@@ ally , however , you &apos;ll be limited by the absence of output on ordinary head@@ phones .
The best and most technically well-@@ equipped teleph@@ ones , with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary head@@ phones , cost up to fifteen thousand crow@@ ns .
The advantage of the music players , on the other hand , is , among other reasons , that they are easy to operate .
Anyone can handle the operation of the sim@@ pl@@ est - not necessarily the most in@@ expensive ( see our selection ) - music players .
The minimum of functions and simil@@ arity in operation to the formerly common c@@ ass@@ ette rec@@ order or even the record player is apparent .
There is no threat of a c@@ lash in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data transmission .
What device to reach for
Even the least expensive cell phones ( e.g. V@@ od@@ af@@ one 5@@ 27 ) generally have a slot for replac@@ eable memory cards ( of the type M@@ 2 , micro@@ SD and the like ) .
Even with the additional purchase of the respective card , you will spend less than two thousand crow@@ ns .
Be careful , however .
With the basic models , only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported .
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards .
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an in@@ expensive MP3 player , reach for C@@ ow@@ on , Cre@@ ativ , Sony , Samsung , Em@@ get@@ on or i@@ river .
Based on capacity ( maximum 2 GB ) you don &apos;t have to spend more than 1,@@ 100 crow@@ ns .
If you are a more demanding listen@@ er , reach instead for specialized cell phones - wal@@ k@@ man ( Sony Eric@@ sson , some Nokia and Samsung models ) .
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-@@ friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player .
Sony Eric@@ sson , whose cell phones from the wal@@ k@@ man series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately , is the most advanced in the field .
The MP3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crow@@ ns , but with a greater memory capacity ( up to 16 GB ) and battery end@@ urance ( normally 15 hours , maxim@@ ally up to 35 hours ) .
First virtual operator to arrive in Cz@@ ech@@ ia this year .
Maybe
The mobile market in Cz@@ ech@@ ia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe .
In spite of this , there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices .
It might be missing for a long time .
We have already written many times on Mobil@@ .@@ cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe .
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unications Bureau , who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union .
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the ro@@ aming fees , a paradox@@ ical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home .
How is it possible that the prices in Cz@@ ech@@ ia remain so high in comparison with Europe ?
The answer is simple , there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle .
Perhaps it sounds paradox@@ ical , after all , we have three mobile networks here and over 100 % coverage .
Mobile operators , on the other hand , like to pre@@ tend that the Czech market is extremely competitive .
This is often secon@@ ded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unications Bureau ( CT@@ B ) P@@ av@@ el D@@ vo@@ ř@@ á@@ k , who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Cz@@ ech@@ ia .
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance ( for that matter , it would be very difficult to find frequ@@ encies ) .
But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator .
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lower@@ ing of prices , to which even the classic operators had to react .
At the same time , even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as T@@ esco Mobile or Virgin Mobile , voices similar to those here could be heard .
But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful .
For that matter , we don &apos;t have to go far to find examples .
In February of this year , we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobil@@ king in Poland .
Over the course of merely half a year , this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator .
At the same time , the financial group P@@ enta , which owns , among others , U : f@@ on , stands behind Mobil@@ king .
The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group .
In order to function effectively , they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does .
That is , they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction , operation and maintenance of a mobile network .
In this way , virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-@@ cost - they offer in@@ expensive calling and text messages , which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services , though .
That &apos;s how , for example , T@@ esco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text mess@@ aging for at least fif@@ ty percent less than its competitors .
But as the example of Mobil@@ king in Poland shows , it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group .
That is , this operator is specifically oriented toward men .
&quot; Real men choose Mobil@@ king - the operator that they like and can trust , &quot; says David Sei@@ bert , the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company , which runs this virtual operator .
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here .
Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Č@@ ep@@ ick@@ ý , spo@@ kes@@ man for V@@ od@@ af@@ one , doubts this : &quot; The Czech market is relatively small for the seg@@ m@@ ented approach on which most virtual operators are founded .
In addition , it &apos;s relatively sat@@ ur@@ ated from the perspective of the offer of services . &quot;
No chance in Cz@@ ech@@ ia , say mobile operators
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Cz@@ ech@@ ia , it won &apos;t be Mobil@@ king .
&quot; We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project , but the negotiations in Cz@@ ech@@ ia don &apos;t look very hop@@ eful .
More likely , Mobil@@ king will be launched in other countries in our region , &quot; said Jan@@ a Stu@@ d@@ ni@@ č@@ kov@@ á , speaker for the P@@ enta financial group , in a telephone interview for Mobil@@ .@@ c@@ z.
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Cz@@ ech@@ ia are definitely not inc@@ lined toward this idea .
Rather , on the contrary , they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competi@@ tor comes into existence .
For a longer period of time now , the GT@@ S No@@ ver@@ a group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator , and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competi@@ tor of Telefon@@ ica O@@ 2 in the area of corporate cli@@ ent@@ ele .
&quot; We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hard@@ wire telecomm@@ unication services , but also mobile ones .
The sooner , the better .
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators .
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them , &quot; said the group &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man , P@@ av@@ el Ka@@ id@@ l .
Perhaps there are better times ahead .
On the basis of un@@ official information , it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year .
In the meantime , however , its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence .
&quot; At this time , we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-@@ fle@@ dged virtual operator .
Compar@@ ed to other markets , the Czech market is very specific .
No subject has appro@@ ached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area , &quot; claimed V@@ las@@ tim@@ il S@@ r@@ š@@ e@@ ň from the public relations department of Telefon@@ ica 02 in a statement for Mobil@@ .@@ c@@ z.
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market .
In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O@@ 2 , T-@@ Mobile spo@@ kes@@ woman Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ rov@@ á added : &quot; We have not yet registered a viable and bilater@@ ally advan@@ tage@@ ous business project that it would be possible to build upon . &quot;
And she added : &quot; No virtual operator is likely to appear in the T-@@ Mobile network by the end of the year .
At this moment , in order to be talking about such a short tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame , we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table . &quot;
V@@ od@@ af@@ one is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3@@ G license .
Regarding this , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Č@@ ep@@ ick@@ ý said : &quot; We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators , above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure .
From the perspective of the customers , we consider this to be the most beneficial .
V@@ od@@ af@@ one &apos;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet . &quot;
Respon@@ sible authorities - bud@@ d@@ y-@@ bud@@ dy with operators
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand , the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition , it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits .
Why , then , make this entrance easy for such a competi@@ tor ?
The tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war surrounding the creation of U : f@@ on att@@ ests to the fact that when something is important to the operators , they are able to pull for the same team .
Prob@@ ably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unication Office was during the time of the creation of U : f@@ on by T-@@ Mobile .
Information publicly available from the Czech Telec@@ omm@@ unication Office &apos;s web pages att@@ ests to this .
But now this is a suitable argument for U : f@@ on to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator .
Regarding that matter , Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ rov@@ á pointed out : &quot; The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently ampli@@ fied by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market .
Consi@@ dering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic , it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services . &quot;
But considering this approach by the mobile operators , the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is , in fact , star@@ t@@ ling .
This means not only the attitude of the C@@ TO , which unfortunately in Cz@@ ech@@ ia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition .
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition ( O@@ PC ) exclusively .
But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue .
&quot; The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator .
No such contract has ever been signed , because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators , &quot; claimed Kris@@ ti@@ án Chal@@ up@@ a from the external relations department of the O@@ PC in his answer to our question .
A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won &apos;t surprise anyone .
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and , among other things , make sure that no one abuses his / her position on the market , it is more than serious .
All the more so when Kris@@ ti@@ án Chal@@ up@@ a added : &quot; In other countries , where virtual operators commonly function , we can observe that their entrance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services . &quot;
But evi@@ dently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the O@@ PC .
In truth , the sho@@ cking element of the whole case is the almost flu@@ id harmony between the three mobile operators that is implic@@ it in their reactions .
The question as to whether this is really just a coinci@@ dence arises entirely by itself .
Just like the exact same price of gas@@ ol@@ ine at the gas stations is surely just the product of coinci@@ dence and the tough competitive battle .
&quot; The Office did not find any signs of actions viol@@ ating the rules of competition , and thus has no reason to intervene in any way .
None of the operators have a dominant position , and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market .
The telecommunications regul@@ ator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtual operators , &quot; Chal@@ up@@ a claimed in his statement .
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disp@@ uted points .
Of course , an analysis of the relevant markets does exist , conducted by C@@ TO , according to which telecommunications are , from the perspective of competition , the only market .
On such a market , none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position .
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator , it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator .
And the mobile operator - entirely log@@ ically - has a monopoly on its network .
So in a certain segment , it must necessarily be dominant .
But even if we did not consider this argument , for the O@@ PC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceed@@ ing in a stri@@ k@@ ingly similar manner .
At the same time , complaints from a series of interested parties ( including the GT@@ S No@@ ver@@ a company mentioned above ) demonstrate that they are encounter@@ ing very similar hur@@ d@@ les in their negotiations with all the operators .
Pl@@ ac@@ ing the responsibility on the C@@ TO is a rather common tri@@ ck in telecommunications , through which the O@@ PC can have nothing to do with the whole matter .
We have already encountered it in several similar cases .
Unfortunately , it was not possible to establish the extension of the C@@ TO &apos;s authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telec@@ omm@@ unications Act , even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation .
The representatives of the O@@ PC must know this very well , but their interests are evi@@ dently elsewhere .
It can be done when nobody &apos;s looking
At the same time , the functioning of some p@@ seu@@ do-@@ virtual operators , of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks , remains un@@ noticed .
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services , which are only partially public .
These are usually companies dealing with multi@@ level marketing .
For example , Am@@ way , Boh@@ em@@ ia Telec@@ om , Star@@ life and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services .
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals .
The tri@@ ck lies in the fact that , in relation to the operator , the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SI@@ M cards .
As a significant client , it then gets special price offers ( and other types of offers ) .
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohi@@ bit such advance sales .
&quot; If the cases you are talking about were to occur , this could be a violation of the contract conditions , which we would investigate , and it could cul@@ min@@ ate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company , &quot; Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ rov@@ á answered our question on this problem .
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators .
This could be a question of thousands of customers , above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above .
But at the same time , none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure .
Nam@@ ely , they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing .
Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Č@@ ep@@ ick@@ ý draws attention to potential problems : &quot; The law enables such speculation , nevertheless only an in@@ significant percentage of customers use the services of these companies .
On top of that , they must accept that the SI@@ M card in their telephone is not registered under their name , and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can . &quot;
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the C@@ TO .
In addition , another question for the O@@ PC arises .
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure , why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ?
It must be added that the O@@ PC has rather considerable power to un@@ cover such activities , and if it does not wish to , it does not have to be satisfied with operators &apos; claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohi@@ bit it .
When we won &apos;t be the most expensive
As mentioned already several times in this article , the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services .
At the same time , classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created .
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small , too sat@@ ur@@ ated , problems with the quality of services , etc .
But in developed countries , the regulatory organs , which supported the interests not of the mobile operators , but of their customers , interven@@ ed at that very moment .
Ei@@ ther through formal measures or informal pressure , they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator , and others continued in its foot@@ steps .
Unfortunately , the Czech regulatory organs have been to@@ ss@@ ing the whole case back and forth like a hot pot@@ ato .
Based on our experience , we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in compet@@ encies in these cases suits them very well .
But let &apos;s not throw in the tow@@ el .
If the beh@@ in@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon , the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again .
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator , it will be difficult for O@@ PC to be able to remain in@@ different to the refusal ( discrimination ) of further interested parties .
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe .
New Czech national an@@ them has four new versions .
Choose the best one
Listen to the four ren@@ der@@ ings of the new version of the Czech national an@@ them .
On Sunday Prime Minister Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ á@@ ne@@ k presented the new recordings of the national an@@ them K@@ de dom@@ ov m@@ ů@@ j ( Where is my Country ) on the occasion of the Day of Czech Stat@@ eh@@ ood .
The an@@ them was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Ji@@ ř@@ í B@@ ě@@ loh@@ l@@ á@@ v@@ ek .
Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo voc@@ als , a ch@@ oral version and an instru@@ mental version .
Kat@@ e@@ ř@@ ina Kn@@ ě@@ ž@@ í@@ n@@ kov@@ á and Adam Pla@@ ch@@ et@@ ka did the singing .
The authors of the arrangements of the an@@ them are O@@ tak@@ ar Jer@@ emi@@ á@@ š and J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Kr@@ č@@ ek .
You can listen to all four versions on the server i@@ HN@@ ed@@ .@@ c@@ z.
B@@ ě@@ loh@@ l@@ á@@ v@@ ek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national an@@ th@@ ems .
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had inten@@ tionally selected sing@@ ers with young , representative voices that were striking and popular for the solo vari@@ ants .
&quot; From the beginning , with both of them and also with the ch@@ or@@ us , I tried to make sure that they had clear artic@@ ulation , so that the text could be understood well , so that they were in harmony , &quot; he said .
The Czech national an@@ them will celebrate its 17@@ 5th anniversary next year .
The song K@@ de dom@@ ov m@@ ů@@ j ( Where is my Country ) was heard for the first time in 18@@ 34 on the stage of the E@@ states Theater in the original Czech play F@@ id@@ lo@@ va@@ č@@ ka by Josef Ka@@ jet@@ án Ty@@ l with the music of Fran@@ ti@@ š@@ ek Š@@ kro@@ up .
It gained popularity and the people spont@@ ane@@ ously took it as their own .
The first stan@@ za of the song then became a natural part of the national an@@ them following the creation of Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia in 19@@ 18 .
It remained one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent Czech Republic .
How the &quot; new &quot; hy@@ m@@ n sounds
Prague City M@@ ass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday , October 1 , 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first travellers board the metro , tr@@ ams and buses with an electronic cou@@ p@@ on in their po@@ ckets instead of a paper ticket .
The roughly one hundred thousand people in possession of their own chip card Open@@ card at this time can get this cou@@ p@@ on .
Trav@@ ellers can buy a 30-@@ day , 9@@ 0-@@ day and year-@@ long cou@@ p@@ on ( which will be valid beginning on January 1 , 2009 ) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Mu@@ ze@@ um , M@@ ů@@ ste@@ k , N@@ á@@ dra@@ ž@@ í Hol@@ e@@ š@@ o@@ vice , And@@ ě@@ l , Ro@@ z@@ ty@@ ly , Let@@ ň@@ any , K@@ ob@@ y@@ li@@ sy , Ra@@ j@@ sk@@ á zah@@ ra@@ da , Ka@@ č@@ ero@@ v and Lu@@ ka .
Beg@@ inning yesterday , cou@@ p@@ ons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Company , www.@@ d@@ pp@@ .@@ c@@ z.
By the afternoon , more than four hundred customers had used the service .
Those beginning to use Internet shopping can defini@@ tively forget about the v@@ ending windows in the metro stations , where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets .
That is , they can buy the cou@@ p@@ on over the Internet and it will be added to the Open@@ card at one of the thir@@ teen branches of the City Library .
&quot; At these locations , there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase , and will also add the purchased cou@@ p@@ on to their card , &quot; said the project &apos;s speaker , Martin Op@@ at@@ r@@ n@@ ý .
In addition to libraries , it will also be possible to add the electronic cou@@ p@@ ons to the Open@@ card at the self-@@ service machines which have been set up in several v@@ esti@@ b@@ ules of the metro .
What do these self-@@ service machines look like ?
They are red , res@@ em@@ bling ticket vali@@ dation machines , and travellers might have already noticed them in the metro stations Ro@@ z@@ ty@@ ly , Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vi@@ ck@@ á , I. P. P@@ av@@ lo@@ va , Flor@@ en@@ c and V@@ l@@ ta@@ v@@ sk@@ á .
&quot; Now there are five of them in the city , but by the end of the year there should be eigh@@ ty of them , &quot; Op@@ at@@ r@@ n@@ ý added .
Cou@@ p@@ on checked by self-@@ service machine instead of driver
Using the self-@@ service machines , which will begin functioning tomorrow , is simple .
All you have to do is insert the Open@@ card chip card , and the pre-@@ paid card is automatically added to it .
The electronic cou@@ p@@ ons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city , but in its surroundings as well .
That is , in sub@@ urban trains and bus lines num@@ ber@@ ed 300 to 4@@ 99 , which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Boh@@ em@@ ian towns to travel into the capital city .
&quot; In trains included in Prague Integr@@ ated Transport , the conduc@@ tors are equipped with card readers , with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons , &quot; Fili@@ p Dr@@ á@@ pal from the organization R@@ op@@ id , which creates the timet@@ ables of the Prague M@@ ass Transport , explained the tick@@ et-@@ checking procedures .
The sub@@ urban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver &apos;s seat .
Upon boarding , it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver , but in addition it is necessary to place the Open@@ card on the designated spot on the side of the cash register .
This is how the driver checks the validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons recorded .
&quot; If the trav@@ eller needs to confirm the validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons recorded , there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver , &quot; Dr@@ á@@ pal added .
Tra@@ vel@@ ers who do not use sub@@ urban buses , and will not remember when the validity of a cou@@ p@@ on ends , can head again for the self-@@ service machines where the cou@@ p@@ ons are added to the card .
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine &apos;s screen .
Su@@ det@@ en@@ lands wanted referendum from USA
Su@@ deten Germans requested that the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region be incorporated into the United States in 1945 .
This is implic@@ it in a letter stored in the collections of the South Boh@@ em@@ ia Research Library .
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria , we wish at least to live under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the United States .
Several groups of Su@@ deten Germans supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type .
This arises from , among other things , a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Boh@@ em@@ ia Research Library .
In the letter , Germans from Č@@ esk@@ ý K@@ rum@@ lov request that the American president not to allow the return of the &quot; Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region &quot; - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia .
&quot; We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as op@@ press@@ ors and enemies , but rather , as liber@@ ators , &quot; is what is written in the letter , signed &quot; People who are not in@@ different to the fate of Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va &quot; .
Since the ann@@ ex@@ ation by Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia supposedly only gives the Su@@ deten Germans hope for - knowing the Czech national character - brut@@ ality , dis@@ regard , lack of understanding , op@@ pression and sla@@ very , the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the prot@@ ec@@ torate of Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va forever .
&quot; We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people , you would award this territory to a state foreign to us , which op@@ pres@@ ses and opp@@ u@@ gn@@ s minorities and which has contributed nothing , absolutely nothing , to the victory of the Al@@ lies , &quot; is written in the letter .
The reason why the authors could not sign their names was the supposed fear of re@@ ven@@ ge by the &quot; Czech op@@ press@@ ors &quot; .
If the president of the USA were to supposedly have doubts about the persu@@ asion of the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va Germans , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region on whether its inhabitants want to become a part of the USA or live under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the United States .
Though the text of the letter may sound a bit na@@ ï@@ ve given the contemporary knowledge of post-@@ war history , according to some witn@@ esses it appropriately sk@@ et@@ ches the expectations of the Su@@ deten Germans at that time .
Even though the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that their displac@@ ement from the country would be discussed , almost none of them admitted this possibility at all .
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a certain type of autonomy for the Su@@ det@@ en@@ lands .
Others believed that they would simply remain in Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia .
The famous journalist Gu@@ stav Chal@@ up@@ a , born in Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice , also confirms this .
As a German from Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice , he was sent to the nav@@ y in the Baltic Sea during the war .
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Hol@@ stein , tens of other Czech Germans went to him so that he would teach them Czech .
&quot; They believed that when they returned home , Czech would come in handy , &quot; Chal@@ up@@ a said .
According to him , none of the German prisoners living in Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia before the war envisaged being displaced from the re@@ public on the basis of the Ben@@ e@@ š Dec@@ re@@ es .
You don &apos;t think - you pay !
Emo@@ tive campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history .
That &apos;s also one way to character@@ ize the emo@@ tive media campaign which the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation plans to launch on Wednesday .
The office of minister A@@ le@@ š Ř@@ eb@@ í@@ č@@ ek hopes that it will dis@@ courage drivers from beh@@ aving danger@@ ously behind the wheel .
The 15@@ 0-@@ milli@@ on-@@ cro@@ wn campaign will appear on television , on the radio , in cin@@ em@@ as , on the Internet , but also on fl@@ yers .
It should dis@@ courage drivers from spe@@ eding and driving under the influence of alcohol .
And also remind them to fa@@ sten their se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts before they start driving .
Above all , it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers , motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts , pedestri@@ ans , and last but not least , professional drivers .
And what appears in the spots ?
Main@@ ly human stories that attack the emotions .
And even the &quot; bloo@@ dy &quot; s@@ logan of the whole campaign att@@ ests to this :
You don &apos;t think - you pay !
The words &quot; you don &apos;t think &quot; are written in capital letters on a license plate .
And then the words &quot; you pay &quot; are in a pool of blood .
This is meant to symboli@@ ze that a person can pay for a moment of car@@ eless@@ ness with his / her own life .
The spots will &quot; ha@@ unt &quot; the vie@@ wers until 2010 .
The mini@@ stry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Ang@@ lo@@ -S@@ ax@@ on countries , where it is common to find pictures with dr@@ astic images of accident victims .
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease .
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RS@@ C@@ G .
Su@@ gar and whi@@ p for drivers
&quot; The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whi@@ p system .
The sugar for them is , for example , when they run a red light , they save time .
The whi@@ p is the threat of a fine or an accident .
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk , &quot; says Martin Ko@@ ř@@ án , a transportation psych@@ ologist from N@@ a Hom@@ ol@@ ce Hospital .
And that &apos;s why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary , the psych@@ ologist believes .
L@@ ess effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers &apos; attention to the danger .
&quot; If a static table which war@@ ns against danger is installed , it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it , &quot; Ko@@ ř@@ án warned .
Ol@@ m@@ ert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The prime minister of the pro@@ visi@@ onal Israeli government , E@@ hu@@ d Ol@@ m@@ ert , expressed his opinion in favour of the res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion of practically all territories occupied in 1967 , that is , even Trans@@ j@@ ord@@ an , East Jerusalem and the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Syria .
He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ oth A@@ hr@@ on@@ oth on Monday .
&quot; We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians , which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the ( occupied ) territories , if not all of them , &quot; Ol@@ m@@ ert told the newspaper .
&quot; We will keep a certain percentage of these territories , but we will have to ce@@ de a similar percentage ( of Israeli territory ) to the Palestinians , because there will be no peace if we don &apos;t do that , &quot; he added .
He admitted that the possible res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion would also include East Jerusalem .
&quot; W@@ ho@@ ever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want trac@@ tors or bul@@ l@@ doz@@ ers to run over his or her legs , like what happened to one of my best friends , will have to give up a part of Jerusalem , &quot; Ol@@ m@@ ert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July , during which several people were killed and tens injured .
According to the prime minister , it will be necessary to find a &quot; special solution for the Temple Mount , a sac@@ red and historic place &quot; , which lies inside the Old City .
&quot; W@@ ho@@ ever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 27@@ 0@@ ,000 Arab@@ s .
That won &apos;t work , &quot; he stressed further .
Le@@ aving Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts
Ol@@ m@@ ert also expressed his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with Syria .
But that would also require certain effort from Dam@@ as@@ cus .
&quot; I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts , &quot; he warned .
&quot; The Syri@@ ans know well what they will have to give up in order to gain the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts .
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran ; they will have to give up their relationship to the ( Shi@@ -@@ ite movement ) He@@ zb@@ ollah ; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to the terrorism of the ( Shi@@ -@@ ite movement ) Hamas , ( the terrorist network ) Al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda and the ji@@ had ( hol@@ y war ) in Iraq , &quot; the prime minister specified .
Questions after accident : Are ste@@ wards in the bus illegal ?
Law doesn &apos;t know them , walking in coach bus not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Stu@@ dent Agency near Pad@@ ua , Italy , the question has ar@@ isen as to whether ste@@ wards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion .
&quot; If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law , the activities of the ste@@ ward are in conflict with the Traff@@ ic Law , &quot; says speaker for the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation Karel Han@@ zel@@ ka .
The accident , during which a twenty-@@ two-@@ year-old ste@@ war@@ d@@ ess died last week , was evi@@ dently caused by the driver of the truck that cross@@ ed into the path of the bus .
Un@@ lu@@ ck@@ ily , at that moment , the girl was sitting next to the driver , in the least safe place in the vehicle , even though there are two more seats reserved for her .
However , the bus can crash or bra@@ ke sharp@@ ly even when the ste@@ ward is hand@@ ing out coffee or newspapers .
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role .
If this is not approved in the bus , the passengers must sit .
The Stu@@ dent Agency coach buses do not have standing room ; which the head of the company , Radi@@ m Jan@@ č@@ ura , also confirmed for Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ c@@ z.
&quot; We tried to find a solution to this with the mini@@ stry , and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers .
Event@@ ually they rev@@ oked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat , &quot; he conve@@ yed his position .
The law does not know the ste@@ ward
&quot; There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the ste@@ ward - no legal en@@ act@@ ments deal with this role .
However , nor do any legal en@@ act@@ ments prohi@@ bit the transpor@@ ters from providing services .
The Traff@@ ic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor ; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person , &quot; speaker Han@@ zel@@ ka added less un@@ ambigu@@ ously .
The head of the Department of Motor V@@ eh@@ ic@@ le Operation of the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation , Josef Po@@ kor@@ n@@ ý , on the contrary , said that the law tre@@ ats this issue sufficiently .
&quot; It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification .
That &apos;s all there is to it , &quot; he says .
B@@ uses are divided into the categories of city bus , where there is standing room and limited maximum speed , inter-@@ city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted , and coach buses , with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat bel@@ ts .
Like in an air@@ plane , says expert
J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Ho@@ ř@@ ín , an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traff@@ ic Safety ( B@@ ES@@ IP ) , does not see any essential problem in the movement of ste@@ wards on the buses .
&quot; During a smooth ride , there is not much threat of danger , the situation can be compared to the service in air@@ planes .
Even there it is not certain when tur@@ bul@@ ence will occur and the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ess can hit her head . &quot;
&quot; However , if the bus were to bra@@ ke sharp@@ ly , of course , the laws of physi@@ cs are valid .
Just like in a city bus or a tram .
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the ste@@ wards through internal regulations , &quot; he says , and he also thinks that from the legal perspective , this issue is un@@ resolved .
Jan@@ č@@ ura willing to dis@@ continue services
Stu@@ dent Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the ste@@ ward service .
It emplo@@ ys nearly two hundred of them .
Even after the accident , the head does not consider their job to be ris@@ ky .
&quot; But as soon as I gain the impression that the ste@@ wards &apos; job is ris@@ ky , I will dis@@ continue them .
Pass@@ engers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding .
It would also save costs , &quot; he says .
Alex@@ e@@ j Lit@@ vin , head of Asi@@ ana , which operates a fra@@ ction of the bus lines that SA does , explained the absence of ste@@ wards in his vehicles as due to safety interests .
&quot; We don &apos;t have ste@@ war@@ d@@ esses , we &apos;ve been against it from the very beginning .
So@@ oner or later it will end in a fat@@ al accident , &quot; he told T@@ ý@@ den@@ .@@ cz nearly a year ago .
En@@ or@@ m@@ ous tragedy occurred
A young ste@@ war@@ d@@ ess from the Pil@@ sen area , who had worked for the company for two years , died in an accident on the bus line to Naples .
A Slovenian trac@@ tor tra@@ iler truck likely left the emergency lan@@ e without sign@@ alling and blocked the path of the bus .
The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeu@@ vre , however , the front right part of the bus gra@@ zed it .
Jan@@ č@@ ura re@@ buff@@ s the claim that the two seats reserved for the ste@@ wards &apos; rest had been sold out .
&quot; It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses , they are blocked . &quot;
The company plans to sue the driver of the truck .
The agency will not wait for the court ver@@ dict to compensate the girl &apos;s family , but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party .
Adap@@ tation of the law ?
Far away
An adaptation of the law , on which a thir@@ ty-@@ member expert group from the Ministry of Transpor@@ tation has been working for over a year , could bring about the specification of the movement of ste@@ wards on board the buses .
&quot; But no concrete conclusion has been reached .
They are not dealing with buses much , it is more the point system , the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving , &quot; says expert Ho@@ ř@@ ín .
&quot; The Ministry of Transpor@@ tation does not consider the activity of the ste@@ wards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way , &quot; concludes speaker Han@@ zel@@ ka , adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office .
Du@@ es@@ sel@@ dorf H@@ opes Rest in Frankfurt
In a letter from the West@@ L@@ B board of directors to the bank &apos;s employees , grand talk is not in short supply .
Com@@ bin@@ ing units of the Du@@ es@@ sel@@ dorf institution with Frankfurt &apos;s Dek@@ a Bank , the notice made public on Monday claims , could `@@ create a major capit@@ al-@@ market institution of the Spar@@ k@@ assen Finanz@@ gruppe . &apos;
West@@ L@@ B would contribute to the deal a `@@ blo@@ c of expertise &apos; with sustained earning power , it says .
Gener@@ ally , the letter suggests , this kind of jo@@ inter might provide the pi@@ vot@@ al impul@@ se for further concentration in the area of the German state banks , the Landes@@ banken .
That &apos;s what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times .
The flag@@ ging West@@ L@@ B is still exposed to tremendous pressure , after all .
Not just from the EU Commission , but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Super@@ vision , which only recently warned the state government of North R@@ hin@@ e-@@ West@@ phal@@ ia that there was an urgent need for a solution .
But talks of some type of jo@@ inter between Dek@@ a Bank , which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment funds , and West@@ L@@ B have been making the rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt .
Pres@@ enting the report on the first two quarters in late August , Dek@@ a Bank head Franz Wa@@ as said a fusion between the institute on Main@@ zer Land@@ strasse and a Landes@@ bank , such as H@@ esse and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia &apos;s Hel@@ aba or West@@ L@@ B , made little sense to him .
But the administrative board of Dek@@ a , which is owned in equal parts by the Landes@@ banken and the savings banks associations , has asked the board of directors to comm@@ ence talks with West@@ L@@ B on joint business v@@ entures .
The possible subject is the capit@@ al-@@ market business , or parts of it .
Of course , as sources in the financial community point out , negotiations have only just begun .
It &apos;s not the first time that the name Dek@@ a Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation .
In 2003 , a mer@@ ger of Dek@@ a Bank with Landes@@ bank R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate and Hel@@ aba briefly seemed to be within the realm of possibility .
But in the end , the thre@@ es@@ ome didn &apos;t happen .
As soon as the plans became public , the H@@ essi@@ an state government spoke out against the participation of Hel@@ aba .
The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement .
Instead , Landes@@ bank R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate was bought by Stuttgart &apos;s Landes@@ bank Bad@@ en-@@ Wu@@ er@@ tt@@ emberg .
But deliber@@ ations on a jo@@ inter between Dek@@ a Bank and Landes@@ banken have continued to rear their heads .
Most recently , Gu@@ en@@ ther Mer@@ l , chairman of the board at Hel@@ aba , had qu@@ elled considerations of a mer@@ ger with his institution .
This aside , there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative .
First up , now that the state elections in Bavaria are over , a jo@@ inter between Bay@@ ern@@ L@@ B and the Landes@@ bank Bad@@ en-@@ Wu@@ er@@ tt@@ emberg may have become more likely .
For Hel@@ aba , that &apos;s not necessarily good news .
Should the pressure for more mer@@ gers increase , it will by degrees be running out of potential partners .
In the South , it would merely be a junior partner , although it has to date we@@ a@@ ther@@ ed the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart .
A mer@@ ger with West@@ L@@ B , in turn , was squ@@ ashed early this year by the Sav@@ ings Bank Association of H@@ esse and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia , which owns 85 percent of Hel@@ aba .
Rem@@ ains only Nord@@ L@@ B .
But such geo@@ strategic considerations are only one side of the equ@@ ation .
On the other stands the question in how far the institutions &apos; different business models are compatible with another .
In June , Mer@@ l said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landes@@ banken had not yet been resolved by the German Sav@@ ings Bank Association .
Ultim@@ ately , West@@ L@@ B might also be split up , although , of course , that &apos;s not a solution favor@@ ed at West@@ L@@ B .
The letter from its board of directors , accordingly , voices the mani@@ fest desire for a `@@ comprehensive solution . &apos;
Quite how this is re@@ conc@@ il@@ able with a jo@@ inter between individual units of West@@ L@@ B and Dek@@ a Bank remains to be seen .
Second Week@@ end at the `@@ Wi@@ esn &apos; Is Know@@ n as `@@ Italian Week@@ end@@ &apos;
For El@@ ena it &apos;s the first time , for Lu@@ ca it &apos;s the third or fourth already .
But this time , he brought along his gir@@ l@@ friend El@@ ena , and that changes everything , he says .
Beh@@ ind them , next to a five-@@ li@@ tre ke@@ g of Kaiser beer , stands a massi@@ vely built bear@@ ded man who is pro@@ ving to the approximately 200 Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest tourists just how deep the sounds are that his thro@@ at his capable of producing .
El@@ ena first sl@@ aps Lu@@ ca , then k@@ is@@ ses him .
They came to Verona from Bologna .
From here , a parking lot for buses next to the rail@@ road station Pu@@ or@@ ta Nu@@ ova , four buses will de@@ part at 11 : 45 tonight , `@@ dest@@ in@@ azione Monaco , fest@@ a della bir@@ ra@@ .@@ ` E@@ stim@@ ated time of arrival : 6 : 30 AM .
Three buses are reserved for Itali@@ ans mainly , one is exclusively for Brazi@@ li@@ ans .
In one corner of the parking lot , the South Americans are already singing next to their flag . They were celebr@@ ating last night already .
And very lou@@ dly , too , says Marco Guar@@ da - too lou@@ dly for Itali@@ ans .
Marco , who we@@ ars a long coat with f@@ ake fur lining and gl@@ asses with broad silver ear@@ pieces , owns the buses .
They have been making trips to the Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest for five years now , three of them this year alone .
They travel at night , spend the day at the `@@ Wi@@ esn &apos; and head back home again at 10 : 30 PM .
St@@ aying over night would only generate unnecessary costs , Marco says .
The trip is 75 Euros , including a welcoming round of Kaiser beer , bre@@ w@@ ed according to the Bavarian P@@ urity Law , health insurance , as well as a German-@@ language guide - Marco en@@ rolled in a language course in Frankfurt .
And with no further ado , the buses head out into the night , on the auto@@ stra@@ da leading to `@@ Brenn@@ ero . &apos;
There is no beer to be had yet .
So@@ on all is quiet in the bus , the travelers are as@@ le@@ ep .
As they should be - they are going to need their strength .
They stop in Bri@@ xen and in Holz@@ kir@@ chen , where dro@@ ves of other buses with Italian plates are making a final stop on the Autobahn 8 , right before Munich .
When Marco &apos;s group finally arri@@ ves , as planned , at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there .
El@@ ena , Lu@@ ca and the others gather . Marco addresses them one last time to give them their mar@@ ching orders .
First up : P@@ ut on the yellow cap@@ s .
On the left side , they say `@@ Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest &apos; in Gothic type , next to the Internet address of Marco &apos;s travel agency , &quot; con@@ osc@@ er@@ si@@ vi@@ ag@@ gi@@ and@@ o.@@ it &quot; .
Second : `@@ When the doors of the beer t@@ ent open , you have to run ! &apos; Marco sh@@ outs into the morning .
`@@ R@@ un ! &apos; R@@ un and man the seats in the rear part of the t@@ ent .
`@@ Not in the front , or else we will block the entry . And not all yellow h@@ ats at the same tables - spread out in the room ! &apos;
It &apos;s 8.@@ 25 Euros per `@@ Maß , &apos; Marco scre@@ ams .
And don &apos;t forget to tip .
`@@ Show the security people that we beh@@ ave !
As soon as you abandon your seats , they &apos;re gone ! &apos;
Third : `@@ Be back here tonight at 10 : 30 sharp ! &apos; Under@@ stood ?
And off to the `@@ Wi@@ esn &apos; they go .
One of them is marking the way by t@@ ying yellow cap@@ s to trees , signs and even to campaign post@@ ers of a political party that &apos;s popular in Bavaria .

It is the second weekend at the `@@ Wi@@ esn , &apos; known as the `@@ Italian Week@@ end . &apos;
There are no exact figures ; estimates say that around 50@@ ,000 make their way across the Alps to des@@ cent on the beer t@@ ents - ten percent of all visitors on this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy specifically for this purpose .
Munich &apos;s police are reinforced by seven polic@@ emen from South Tyrol , and Italian volunte@@ ers are lending support to the Bavarian Red Cross , according to whose statistics on nationals the Itali@@ ans are leading the medi@@ cal@@ -@@ attention field with about 200 cases , with Austri@@ ans ( about 80 cases ) and Brit@@ ons ( about 60 cases ) coming in second and third .

No S@@ le@@ ep for H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate Cre@@ di@@ tors
As recently as last week , German Finance Minister Pe@@ er Stein@@ bru@@ eck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable .
It &apos;s a good thing that the politi@@ cian used the term `@@ relatively , &apos; further inter@@ j@@ ecting that the German banking sector w@@ ouldn &apos;t be spar@@ ed by the crisis .
Because that &apos;s what happened this weekend .
The real-@@ estate bank H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate ( HR@@ E ) from Munich , which is listed in the DA@@ X stock index , is receiving credits in the billions from a con@@ sortium of German banks in order to be shi@@ el@@ ded against the market tur@@ bul@@ ences .
An individual close to the proceedings told R@@ eu@@ ters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total .
H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using , they said .
The money was coming from private as well as public banks , they added .
The news comes in the wake of losses at subsidiary Dep@@ fa .
According to a news report , the govern@@ ment-@@ funding bank had re@@ financed long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which , due to the mi@@ str@@ ust at the markets , is no longer a possibility .
In the first half-@@ year of 2008 , the bank &apos;s cash reserve had shr@@ unk by 95 percent to 2.@@ 37 Euros , with the capital resource quota also slightly dec@@ lining from 1.@@ 6 to 1.@@ 45 percent .
The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to ni@@ l compared to the same period in the previous year , while earnings from writ@@ e-@@ ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liqui@@ dation of acc@@ ru@@ als from credit transactions had shr@@ unk by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros .
The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through re@@ funds from down@@ stream accounting costs from restructuring the former Dep@@ fa Group , as well as from re@@ funds of interest according to the Fis@@ cal Code and from agency for group companies .
After going private in 1990 , the former govern@@ ment-@@ funding bank had initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-@@ es@@ ate credits , which were then out@@ sour@@ ced to A@@ are@@ al Bank .
Because earnings in classical govern@@ ment-@@ funding were sli@@ m , Dep@@ fa had diversi@@ fied internationally , increasingly eng@@ aging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint v@@ entures between private investors and the government ( Pub@@ lic@@ -@@ Private Partnership , PP@@ P ) .
Now H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate has to indu@@ ce writ@@ e-@@ off@@ s according to the subsidiary &apos;s worth that will have a `@@ significant , material effect &apos; on the group &apos;s profit@@ -and-@@ loss statement , it said rather v@@ agu@@ ely .
As a matter of fact , the divi@@ dend has been om@@ itted .
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007 .
Since the acquisition of Dep@@ fa , H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate has been a significant finan@@ c@@ er of government and infrastructure .
Because it does not have client deposits , it is more dependent on re@@ financing at the inter@@ bank market than other banks .
With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers , the extension of loans among banks has largely dri@@ ed up again , because banks are ho@@ arding their assets .
For part of Dep@@ fa &apos;s loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion Euros - H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate annually requires short-term capital for re@@ financing .
According to H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate , the credits meet the group &apos;s financing requirements for the fores@@ ee@@ able future , shi@@ el@@ ding the cor@@ poration from `@@ the influence of the currently largely incap@@ ac@@ it@@ ated international financial markets . &apos;
Other sources say that , thanks to the credits , re@@ financing is covered until late 2009 .
HR@@ E chairman of the board Georg Fun@@ ke said that , in the fores@@ ee@@ able future , the H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again , however .
The Deutsche Bundes@@ bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Super@@ vision ( Ba@@ F@@ in ) are now considering the H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate Group &apos;s market@@ ability to be secured .
On behalf of the bank &apos;s shareholders and credi@@ tors , it is to be hoped they are right .
But given the dynamics and the un@@ pre@@ dict@@ ability of the crisis , things are likely to remain uncertain .
It &apos;s not even un@@ thin@@ k@@ able that not all of the financing will be needed .
The opposite cannot be dis@@ counted either , however .
After the bank was report@@ edly close to in@@ sol@@ vent late Sunday night , even a b@@ ail@@ out , temporary as it is , is incap@@ able of easing people &apos;s minds .
The price per share is dro@@ pping by 75 percent to 3.@@ 30 Euros .
B@@ ond prices are holding up reasonably well , mean@@ while .
Wher@@ eas senior debts are hardly moving , junior bonds are dro@@ pping more significantly .
This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wu@@ er@@ tt@@ emberg H@@ yp@@ o and , understand@@ ably , to re@@ payment periods beyond 2009 .
To date , H@@ yp@@ o Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for spec@@ ulative investment . After the financial crisis , as well as the bank &apos;s own hom@@ em@@ ade crisis caused by the acquisition of Dep@@ fa , however , their recover@@ ability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system .
As long as central banks , governments and less stri@@ cken corporate banks are still willing to support the system , bond settlement deadlines can be met .
Altern@@ atively , that which nobody dar@@ es to hope for yet right now comes to pass , and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months .
But considering that one report of partial nation@@ alization is ch@@ asing the next , a prob@@ ability bor@@ dering on certainty has now shr@@ unk to a valid hope .
This may be causing some sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess nights for long-term credi@@ tors in particular , as they pon@@ der the question whether or not to abandon their exposure .
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term investors may at least use the line that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss car@@ r@@ y-@@ forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come .
Sy@@ lv@@ ana and the Sec@@ rets of the Ben@@ to Box
When Sy@@ lv@@ ana Hil@@ tro@@ p , 16 years old , is asked to introduce herself on her first day at T@@ ach@@ i@@ ban@@ a High School , the girls begin to gi@@ ggle : The German girl is totally `@@ ka@@ wai@@ i &apos; !
What this means ?
Sy@@ lv@@ ana is familiar with the term from reading man@@ ga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan .
`@@ First day at school in Japan .
I was so exc@@ ited .
The way to school alone gave me the j@@ it@@ ters .
I live at the edge of Tokyo , towards Ka@@ was@@ aki , and the train ride to T@@ ach@@ i@@ ban@@ a High School is 40 minutes .
I had to find the way on my own , and lu@@ ck@@ ily I didn &apos;t get lost .
The beginning of class isn &apos;t organized as strictly as back home in L@@ ower Sax@@ ony .
Stu@@ dents begin tri@@ ck@@ ling in at eight o &apos;@@ clock , until a brief conference with the teacher , the `@@ home room , &apos; starts at 8 : 40 .
But before class began , it was my turn to introduce myself .
I &apos;m not someone who likes to talk in front of other people , mind you , let alone a class of 40 .
Because I didn &apos;t have a school uniform yet , I was dres@@ sed in one of my host mother &apos;s old sk@@ ir@@ ts , as well as a bl@@ ouse , blue stock@@ ings and black leather shoes .
In this atti@@ re , I stood before the desk and tried to pron@@ ounce everything correctly : &apos; S@@ ay@@ on@@ ara Wo she Sy@@ lv@@ ana ... &apos; - my name is Sy@@ lv@@ ana , I &apos;m from Germany and my birthday is a week from now .
At that moment , I was very glad that I &apos;d been learning the language for two years already .
The 31 girls in class were all wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing and gi@@ ggling among themselves and w@@ aving at me , and I kept hearing the word `@@ ka@@ wai@@ i . &apos;
I already knew it from my man@@ ga .
It &apos;s part of the essential voc@@ abul@@ ary of Japanese girls and means `@@ cu@@ te , &apos; `@@ sweet . &apos;
Then I s@@ cur@@ ried to my seat .
The girl beside me was sm@@ iling rather brigh@@ tly . She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be se@@ ated next to her .
The rest of class was pretty un@@ event@@ ful , but when the bel@@ l rang , they were all practically crow@@ ding me .
They were talking all at once and gi@@ gg@@ led and bom@@ bar@@ ded me with one question after another , even though Japanese English is really hard to understand .
Then , during the break , everybody got out their b@@ ent@@ os .
My host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me , too - it &apos;s something else than the ble@@ ak German lunch break sand@@ wich@@ es .
I had rice with her@@ bs , little s@@ aus@@ ages , sal@@ ad made from cu@@ cum@@ ber and al@@ ga@@ e , fruit and some kind of meat in a to@@ fu coat .
Most of the time I don &apos;t have the first clu@@ e what I &apos;m eating here in Japan .
The stuff looks wei@@ rd and has a completely novel taste .
I can say this : It &apos;s all delicious .
Well , except for the sal@@ ty pl@@ ums in oil , that is . Y@@ euch !
At Japanese schools , the b@@ ent@@ os aren &apos;t just lunch .
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a hom@@ em@@ ade ben@@ to that she &apos;s fixed in a particularly f@@ ancy way to a boy , in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break .
I read about that in my man@@ ga .
I &apos;m looking forward to finding out whether that &apos;s happening here , too .
`@@ Why Japan , of all places ? , &apos; my gir@@ l@@ friends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year .
And I always told them :
`@@ Because it happens to fascin@@ ate me . &apos;
After all , man@@ ga have been my favorite reading material for years .
And in order to have a better understanding of the com@@ ics and the culture in them , I eventually started to learn a little Japanese , as well .
So for me it &apos;s been a no-@@ bra@@ iner that I would have to come here eventually .
Because I also have a pen@@ ch@@ ant for tradition , mann@@ ers and customs .
And those are considered very important here .
On the one hand , Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends , but on the other hand it is strict , discipl@@ ined and traditional .
And because everything is so well-@@ organized , I haven &apos;t felt lost yet , even though Tokyo is the biggest city I &apos;ve ever seen .
Rats Have Fe@@ elings , Too
When in danger , a rat or ro@@ ach will run away . Does it mean they experience fear , too ?
Neur@@ o@@ scienti@@ st Joseph Le@@ Dou@@ x is convinced that many animals have feelings , as well .
But if they act the same way we do , how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings ?
The Internet magazine `@@ E@@ dge &apos; has been running pieces by famous scientists for years .
In a series , SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL ON@@ LIN@@ E presents a selection of responses to the question , `@@ What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it ? &apos;
I believe that animals have feelings , as well as other modes of awareness , although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date . For that matter , we haven &apos;t even been able to prove that other people possess awareness .
But in that case , we can at least hope , since all human bra@@ ins possess the same basic configuration .
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general , however , we are entering difficult terrain , because the hardware is not compatible .
When a rat is in danger , it does the same thing as many other animals : It plays pos@@ sum , runs away or attacks .
Hum@@ ans beh@@ ave simil@@ arly , which leads some scientists to conclude that the subj@@ ective experience is comparable .
But I don &apos;t believe that .
There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subj@@ ective experience onto animals .
For one thing , those circu@@ its almost always involved in human awareness include the later@@ al pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex ( due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions ) .
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other prim@@ ates , and it seems to be entirely missing in other creatures .
So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other prim@@ ates .
Another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man &apos;s linguistic nature : Because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language , it &apos;s often said that their awareness depends on it .
In that case , animals could be excluded .
But even if awareness was not dependent on language , it would certainly be affected by it , meaning that animal awareness , however it may be defined , would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness .
That &apos;s why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be like .
If you have something that , being internal and subj@@ ective , can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analy@@ zed according to our own experience , then its study comes with significant challenges .
My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness , but aside from that , there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scienti@@ fically .
Ani@@ mal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content , and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening in the study of the short-term memory of prim@@ ates , particularly when it comes to the example of visu@@ alization .
But this approach , which was followed by Christ@@ of K@@ och and Franc@@ is Cri@@ ck , is concerned with the ne@@ ural cor@@ relates of awareness rather than the caus@@ al mechanisms , which may or may not be identical .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , this approach also empha@@ sizes the significance of the pre@@ fron@@ tal cor@@ tex for the generation of the visu@@ alization .
What does this mean for feelings , now ?
Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is trig@@ gered in a brain that &apos;s aware of its own activity .
What we call `@@ fear , &apos; consequently , is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain ( or its effects , such as physical reactions ) is using virtual memory .
From that perspective , feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cor@@ tex which are unique to prim@@ ates , and humans in particular .
In conjunction with the linguistic nature , the result are delicate emotional sha@@ des , because through words and gramm@@ ar we can differenti@@ ate between states and categ@@ ori@@ ze them , in order to project them onto others as well .
In contrast to this , Antonio Dam@@ asi@@ o sup@@ poses , for instance , that feelings result from more pri@@ mi@@ tive activities in the areas of the cor@@ text and the bra@@ inst@@ em concerned with bo@@ di@@ ly sens@@ ations . Ja@@ ak P@@ ank@@ se@@ ep says something similar , but his focus is more on the bra@@ inst@@ em .
Since this network ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t changed in the course of human evolution , they say , it might well be a cause of cross-@@ species sens@@ ations .
In theory , I can &apos;t disagree with that , but I consider it impro@@ vable .
P@@ ank@@ se@@ ep argu@@ es that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it , as well , in both cases . But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways ?
A ro@@ ach &apos;s response to danger is flight . Does it experience fear ?
As far as I &apos;m concerned , a mere simil@@ arity of actions is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences .
The ne@@ ural comparison is helpful , granted : Rats and humans have similar bra@@ inst@@ ems , whereas ro@@ aches do not even have bra@@ ins .
But is the bra@@ inst@@ em responsible for emotions ?
And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats ?
I believe rats and other m@@ amm@@ als - maybe even ro@@ aches ( who knows ? ) - have emotions .
But I w@@ ouldn &apos;t know how to prove it .
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours ( since human awareness is based on specific circu@@ its and on language ) , I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sens@@ ations of rats .
There is the promise of results on the ne@@ ural level here , in any case , provided the same can be measured in rats and humans .
Just like I don &apos;t study language and awareness in rats , neither do I study their emotions , given that I don &apos;t even know if they exist .
One may consider that to be short-@@ si@@ ghted , but I prefer to make progress , rather than to keep h@@ itting a wall .
I just happen to be a practical emotion@@ alist .
U@@ EFA President Plat@@ ini : Rep@@ rie@@ ve for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister I@@ van V@@ asy@@ uni@@ k said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister .
`@@ The government considers U@@ EFA &apos;s decision a display of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the Eur@@ oc@@ up together with Poland , &apos; V@@ asy@@ uni@@ k said .
`@@ This is no am@@ nesty for our country .
Work has only just begun , and there is much still to be done in both countries . &apos;
The two hosts are behind on the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of sta@@ di@@ ums , roads , hotels and airports .
Even a reduction of the number of Euro sta@@ di@@ ums from eight to six is possible .
`@@ We cannot waste any more time .
We have to proceed at great speed now , &apos; said G@@ rig@@ ori@@ y Sur@@ k@@ is , president of the Ukrainian so@@ cc@@ er association .
`@@ U@@ EFA will be keeping an eye on us constantly . &apos;
An even more radical measure was taken in Poland .
After numerous sc@@ and@@ als , the leadership of the Polish association P@@ Z@@ P@@ N was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Z@@ aw@@ lock@@ i .
The commission had been assemb@@ led at the request of Minister of Sport Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Dr@@ z@@ evi@@ eck@@ i .

F@@ light and Hotel Rates Dro@@ p
In the first half-@@ year of 2008 , flights and rooms in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year .
In Germany , flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent , a current survey says .
Rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again , according to a survey by travel and financial services provider American Express .
Analy@@ zing its booking data from the first half-@@ year of 2008 , the company found that , after an increase of rates in the first quarter , there was a significant drop in the second quarter .
Following years of increasing rates in the hotel market , rooms have already become cheaper in many places .
From January to March , rates in 41 out of 48 analy@@ zed European cities were still increasing by an average 6.@@ 9 percent compared to 2007 .
But from April to June , rates had already dropped by 3.@@ 6 percent ver@@ sus the previous year .
The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome , the survey says , where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago .
American Express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this , as it results in a `@@ decre@@ asing desire for travel among American tourists . &apos;
Financial centers like Frankfurt and London were hit harder by the dro@@ pping hotel rates than industry locations such as Hannover , Cologne or St@@ av@@ anger , it further says .
With an increase of 2@@ 6.@@ 3 percent , hotel rates in the Norweg@@ ian city are holding the record for Europe , even .
F@@ light rates were also still tr@@ ending up in the first quarter .
Due to the increasing cost of ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e , econom@@ y-@@ class travelers had to pay 7.@@ 1 percent more on average than in 2007 , while rates for more fu@@ el-@@ intensive long-@@ range flights even went up by as much as 2@@ 9.@@ 2 percent .
From April to June , econom@@ y-@@ class flight rates dropped by an average 12.@@ 5 percent ver@@ sus the preced@@ ing quarter , whereas business@@ - and first-class price changes were much less notic@@ eable .
In Germany , rates dropped even more sharp@@ ly than in other European countries .
From January to March , rates had increased by 11.@@ 9 percent , in the second quarter they dropped by 23.@@ 6 percent .
The rates of domestic German flights were hal@@ ved even , a survey says .
On the one hand , the sudden drop in rates was the result of the s@@ lowing economic growth , the company says .
Dem@@ and was rec@@ eding in many segments of the air-@@ travel market , it says .
On the other hand , there was an increase in competitive pressure through the Open Sk@@ ies Agreement , which dereg@@ ul@@ ates air travel between the U.S. and Europe .
Among the signs of increasing tension were the can@@ cel@@ ation of un@@ profitable routes at airlines , it says , as well as the high number of airlines fil@@ ing for bank@@ rupt@@ cy in the first half-@@ year of 2008 - in Europe alone , it was 24 airlines , it says .

Later , the D@@ ow Jones somewhat rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated again .
Around 8 : 30 PM the world &apos;s most significant market indicator listed with 10@@ ,@@ 5@@ 79 points , with a min@@ us of more than five percent .
The technology stock exchange Nas@@ da@@ q was at 15@@ 48 points , with a min@@ us of more than seven percent .
In the D@@ ow , the biggest losses were suffered by American Express at this stage , which dropped by 14 percent , as well as by the Bank of America , which lost around twelve percent .
There were no increases for any shares .
Shar@@ es of the bank Gold@@ man Sach@@ s dec@@ lined by approximately ten percent .

Dar@@ k Mat@@ ter Aff@@ ects F@@ light of Space Prob@@ es
For years , a mysteri@@ ous phenomenon has had researchers st@@ ump@@ ed : Dar@@ k matter is affecting the speed of space prob@@ es during so-called sw@@ ing-@@ by man@@ eu@@ vers .
Exper@@ ts fear that Albert Ein@@ stein &apos;s general theory of rel@@ ativity may not be entirely correct .
For almost 18 years , the probe `@@ U@@ ly@@ ss@@ es &apos; has been flying through space .
Due to free@@ zing fuel lines , it is now threatening to shut down .
Among scientists , a mysteri@@ ous phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Sw@@ ing@@ -B@@ y An@@ om@@ al@@ y .
The sw@@ ing-@@ by is a flight man@@ eu@@ ver during which space prob@@ es gain additional acceler@@ ation in the gra@@ vit@@ ational field of a cel@@ esti@@ al body , such as Earth .
It enables the prob@@ es to save a lot of fuel .
The Europe@@ an-@@ American research probe C@@ ass@@ ini@@ -@@ Hu@@ y@@ gens made use of this physical tri@@ ck , as did the solar probe U@@ ly@@ ss@@ es .
But what resear@@ ches have been wonder@@ ing about for years is this : The objects in flight are not beh@@ aving precisely in the way we have come to expect according to the ven@@ er@@ able law of grav@@ itation .
Rather , there are irregularities in their speed .
The prob@@ es un@@ expect@@ edly become faster or s@@ lower .
To date , physi@@ ci@@ sts have been unable to explain this effect .
They have du@@ b@@ bed it the Sw@@ ing@@ -B@@ y An@@ om@@ al@@ y .
Some experts fear that even Albert Ein@@ stein &apos;s general theory of rel@@ ativity , which describes the gra@@ vit@@ ational pull of matter through a cur@@ v@@ ature of space , may not be entirely correct .
The American physi@@ c@@ ist Stephen Ad@@ ler at the Institute for Advanced Stu@@ dy in Princ@@ et@@ on still firmly believes that Ein@@ stein did not er@@ r , and is trying to explain the Sw@@ ing@@ -B@@ y An@@ om@@ al@@ y by way of the so-called dark matter that astronom@@ ers discovered in the universe .
`@@ It could be dark matter existing very close to Earth that may be responsible for the an@@ om@@ al@@ y , &apos; he writes .
Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years .
E@@ vi@@ dently , it em@@ its a gra@@ vit@@ ational force whose effect on other cel@@ esti@@ al bodies is measur@@ able .
The dark matter itself is completely in@@ visible , however , meaning that it neither sends nor em@@ its any electro@@ magnetic radiation whatsoever , such as , consequently , visible light in particular .
According to the scientists &apos; calculations , dark matter constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe .
Ab@@ duc@@ ted Tour@@ ists in Egypt Rel@@ e@@ ased
After being held ho@@ stage by their cap@@ tors for ten days , the tourists ab@@ duc@@ ted in Egypt have evi@@ dently been released , as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister .
The ab@@ duc@@ tors from Sudan had demanded a ran@@ som of several million Euros .
In a sho@@ ot-@@ out preced@@ ing the rescue , six of their cap@@ tors were report@@ edly killed .
In the south of Egypt , five Germans have been ab@@ duc@@ ted .
Neg@@ oti@@ ations concerning a ran@@ som are report@@ edly already under@@ way .
Time and again , Germans end up in the cross@@ ha@@ irs of kid@@ n@@ app@@ ers .
`@@ Welt Online &apos; reports the most notable cases .
The European tourists ab@@ duc@@ ted in the Sahara have apparently been fre@@ ed .
Re@@ ports by Egyptian state television , the Arab@@ ian TV channel al-@@ Arab@@ i@@ ya and Italian media are in accordance on that .
According to Italian TV channel Sky T@@ G 24 , Italian Foreign Minister Fran@@ co Frattini confirmed the release : `@@ Our fellow citizens and the other host@@ ages have been fre@@ ed .
Right now we are checking their health , &apos; Frattini said .
The five Germans , five Itali@@ ans , one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian compani@@ ons were safe and sound , Egyptian state television reported .
The 19 participants of a desert ex@@ pedition were already on their way to Cairo , it said .
The circumstances of the sho@@ ot-@@ out preced@@ ing the release remain unclear : According to an Egyptian security agent , the cap@@ tors were ready to end the ab@@ duction when the Su@@ dan@@ ese army suddenly killed six of the ab@@ duc@@ tors .
`@@ The problem had been solved .
They had agreed to a ran@@ som , &apos; the agent said .
It had been `@@ only a matter of receiving the host@@ ages , &apos; when suddenly `@@ this surprise &apos; happened .
On Sunday , Su@@ dan@@ ese soldiers had shot dead six of the ab@@ duc@@ tors and taken two as prisoners in the border region between Sudan , C@@ had and Egypt .
The ab@@ duc@@ tors had demanded a ran@@ som of six million Euros from Germany ; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the host@@ ages .
C@@ iting a German negoti@@ ator , the daily newspaper `@@ El Mas@@ ri El J@@ om &apos; reported that the release was being delayed because the kid@@ n@@ app@@ ers were fear@@ ing for their safety .
According to the report , the ab@@ duc@@ tors intended to release the female host@@ ages once the ran@@ som had been paid .
The men were to be held cap@@ tive until the ab@@ duc@@ tors would have secured an escape route .
The German emb@@ ass@@ y in Cairo dec@@ lined to comment on the report .
Step@@ father abuse &quot; led to suicide &quot;
Y@@ ears of abuse by her step@@ father led a woman to kill herself , a court has been told .
Michael Tr@@ er@@ ise , 57 , of Sti@@ thi@@ ans , Corn@@ wall , was j@@ ailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of in@@ decent ass@@ ault .
Tr@@ ur@@ o Cro@@ wn Court heard he regularly tied up his step@@ -@@ daughter Steph@@ an@@ ie Rand@@ le , when she was aged between five and seven .
Tr@@ er@@ ise wrote in a con@@ fes@@ sion note : &quot; I feel responsible for her death . &quot;
The court heard that Ms Rand@@ le killed herself at her home in Mut@@ ley , Pl@@ ym@@ outh , on 1 April 2007 , aged 34 .
When she was a child living in Co@@ v@@ entry , Tr@@ er@@ ise had tied her up and blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded her before performing sexual acts , while her mother was out working at a pub .
Tr@@ er@@ ise and his wife di@@ vor@@ ced in the 1980s , and he returned to live in Corn@@ wall .
His step@@ -@@ daughter went to Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
But the court heard that Ms Rand@@ le , who spent much of her time volunte@@ ering for the National Tr@@ ust , was ha@@ un@@ ted by the abuse which had been inf@@ lic@@ ted on her twi@@ ce-@@ weekly .
By 2006 , prosec@@ utor Ram@@ sey Qu@@ ai@@ fe told the court , friends said Ms Rand@@ le , who had been a keen sur@@ fer and cy@@ cli@@ st , was &quot; emo@@ tionally dead &quot; , and had &quot; given up on life &quot; .
In April 2007 her real father , Ter@@ ran@@ ce Rand@@ le , found her dead at her flat in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
She is thought to have killed herself through suff@@ oc@@ ation using a plastic bag .
Mr Rand@@ le confronted his daughter &apos;s step@@ -@@ father , who wrote a con@@ fes@@ sion letter which ended : &quot; I used to tie her up and blin@@ d@@ fold her .
&quot; I didn &apos;t sex@@ ually ass@@ ault her .
I feel responsible for her death . &quot;
Ju@@ dge Christop@@ her El@@ wen told Tr@@ er@@ ise : &quot; You are an extremely strange fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ist , and for your victim it must have been ter@@ rif@@ ying , especially when she was only seven .
&quot; This un@@ pleasant sag@@ a ends with the victim taking her own life .
Even more stark , is the fact that had she not done so , it &apos;s very doub@@ t@@ ful that matters would have ended up in court . &quot;
He added : &quot; I note the effect Steph@@ an@@ ie &apos;s father and mother describe your crime having on their daughter over the years .
&quot; She was pl@@ ain@@ ly otherwise likely to have been a promising , successful and happy young woman . &quot;
Lo@@ st data official to be charged
The Cab@@ inet Office official who left top-@@ secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Sec@@ rets Act , the BBC has learned .
The man was on sec@@ ond@@ ment from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Water@@ lo@@ o .
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police .
It is the least sensitive charge under the act and there is no suggestion of criminal intent .
BBC defence correspon@@ dent Frank Gar@@ dner said the move would have come as a surprise to many in Whit@@ eh@@ all .
&quot; They will have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mo@@ D and Cab@@ inet Office , &quot; he said .
The employee , who cannot be named , is being charged under section 8.@@ 1 of the act , the clause which deals with safeguarding information .
The Cro@@ wn Pro@@ sec@@ ution Service recommended the official should be charged by the Metro@@ politan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelli@@ gence Committee .
The documents he mis@@ placed contained classified assessments about al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda and the capabilities of Iraq &apos;s security forces .
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an un@@ disclos@@ ed location .
Building societies face B &amp; B bill
Britain &apos;s building societies could face a bill of more than £ 80@@ m after the rescue of the Bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; B@@ ing@@ ley bank .
The Government provided £ 14@@ b@@ n to protect the deposits of Bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; B@@ ing@@ ley &apos;s 2.@@ 6 million sa@@ vers .
The interest on that loan will be paid by all firms that take sa@@ vers &apos; money , including the 59 building societies .
The director general of the Building Soci@@ eties Association ( BS@@ A ) Adri@@ an Col@@ es said it was &quot; g@@ alling &quot; that societies and their members had to pay .
The £ 14@@ b@@ n loan will eventually be re@@ paid as Bra@@ d@@ ford &amp; B@@ ing@@ ley &apos;s mort@@ g@@ ages are re@@ deemed .
But the interest which will acc@@ rue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits .
The Financial Services Comp@@ ens@@ ation Sch@@ eme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies would be included in that number .
It is g@@ alling that those institutions that beh@@ aved pru@@ dently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the b@@ ills of those institutions that were far less pru@@ dent
Adri@@ an Col@@ es , BS@@ A
It said each firm had to pay in proportion to the deposits it held , and that the societies between them had to pay about 18 % of the cost .
The Treas@@ ury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £ 4@@ 50@@ m in 2009 .
That means the societies will have to find £ 8@@ 1@@ m to pay the first year &apos;s interest .
Adri@@ an Col@@ es , director general of the building societies &apos; trade association , told the BBC he believes that is unfair .
&quot; It is g@@ alling that those institutions that beh@@ aved pru@@ dently in the housing market up@@ s@@ wing are now being called upon to pay some of the b@@ ills of those institutions that were far less pru@@ dent . &quot;
According to the BS@@ A , no society has failed since its records began in 1945 .
&quot; We will need to examine all the aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill , &quot; added Mr C@@ ole .
The interest due in 2009 cover seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March .
In 2010 a full year &apos;s interest will be due and that could be almost twice as much .
Since building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders , their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates on saving accounts .
Mil@@ k to go up five p@@ ence a li@@ tre
People in Jer@@ sey are facing having to pay more for their milk .
Jer@@ sey D@@ air@@ y has announced that it will increase the wholes@@ ale price of its milk by an extra five p@@ ence a li@@ tre from Monday .
It is the second price increase this year , following a two p@@ ence rise in February , and comes after research carried out by a consultancy company .
Ret@@ ail@@ ers are to decide for themselves if they want pass on the price increases to their customers .
Before the February increase , the wholes@@ ale price of Jer@@ sey milk last changed in 2002 .
Banglad@@ esh ex-@@ PM is denied b@@ ail
A Banglad@@ esh court has rejected a b@@ ail ple@@ a of former PM S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina , meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country .
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her b@@ ail over charges of ext@@ or@@ ting 50 million tak@@ a ( $ 7@@ 29@@ ,@@ 700 ) from a business@@ man when she was PM .
The case is one of several corruption charges pending against her .
S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina &apos;s long-@@ time political ri@@ val , K@@ hal@@ eda Z@@ ia , was released on b@@ ail earlier this month .
S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina is due to return to Banglad@@ esh over the next few weeks but her party , the A@@ w@@ ami League , has demanded that the country &apos;s militar@@ y-@@ backed car@@ et@@ aker government should first give her full freedom .
Cor@@ respon@@ dents say that while she was given par@@ ole to go abroad for medical treatment , it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Banglad@@ esh .
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court order .
&quot; The High Court rejected S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina &apos;s b@@ ail petition saying that she doesn &apos;t have to get b@@ ail as she &apos;s already under@@ going treatment abroad on par@@ ole , &quot; her barri@@ ster Raf@@ i@@ qu@@ e-@@ ul Hu@@ q said .
&quot; We &apos;ll file an appeal against the High Court order . &quot;
Her lawyers argued that she needed b@@ ail to come back to the country from abroad to prepare for elections in December .
S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina is expected to return home after 17 October , a senior A@@ w@@ ami League party leader said on Sunday .
She was det@@ ained last year after the arm@@ y-@@ backed interim government assumed power , but was released from prison in June , to go abroad for medical treatment .
Both S@@ heik@@ h Has@@ ina and K@@ hal@@ eda Z@@ ia deny all charges against them .
F@@ ears for Afghan anti-@@ poli@@ o drive
Almost 200@@ ,000 children in Afghanistan missed out on a recent poli@@ o imm@@ un@@ isation drive because of violence linked to the Tal@@ eb@@ an , the UN says .
The UN carried out a vacc@@ ination programme in six provin@@ ces last week .
But it says it could not reach children in parts of Hel@@ m@@ and and K@@ and@@ ah@@ ar in the south for security reasons .
A UN spo@@ kes@@ man said this was despite ple@@ dges from the Tal@@ eb@@ an that they would not attack or ob@@ struc@@ t thousands of staff carrying out the vacc@@ inations .
B@@ Sky@@ B loses I@@ TV legal challenge
B@@ Sky@@ B has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission &apos;s decision forcing the firm to reduce its stake in ri@@ val broad@@ c@@ aster I@@ TV .
B@@ Sky@@ B has been told by the Competition Ap@@ pe@@ al Tri@@ bunal to cut its holding in I@@ TV from 17.@@ 9 % to below 7.@@ 5 % .
Pre@@ viously , the commission said that B@@ Sky@@ B &apos;s stake th@@ war@@ ted competition and allowed it unfair influence over I@@ TV .
B@@ Sky@@ B bought the stake in 2006 in a deal which effectively blocked NT@@ L , now ren@@ amed Virgin Media , from buying I@@ TV .
In April 2007 , the Office of Fair Trading reported that B@@ Sky@@ B &apos;s acquisition of its stake in I@@ TV shed doubt on the independence of I@@ TV , promp@@ ting the Competition Commission to launch a probe .
Virgin bo@@ ss Sir Richard Bran@@ son , consumer groups and the regul@@ ator O@@ f@@ com all opposed the purchase .
B@@ Sky@@ B argued that forcing it to reduce its I@@ TV stake was un@@ reasonable and a dis@@ proportionate remedy - particularly as B@@ Sky@@ B had said it would sur@@ render its voting rights .
New probe into US att@@ or@@ ney affair
The US att@@ or@@ ney general has appointed a special prosec@@ utor to look into the fir@@ ing of nine US att@@ or@@ neys in 2006 .
The move came as a report into the affair by the inspec@@ tor general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials .
The report was critical of White House officials , law@@ makers and the former Att@@ or@@ ney General Alber@@ to Gonz@@ ales .
The investigation was promp@@ ted by fears that the att@@ or@@ neys had been removed for political reasons .
Special Pro@@ sec@@ utor Nor@@ a D@@ ann@@ eh@@ y will now investigate whether officials ques@@ tioned during the probe lied to investig@@ ators in an attempt to ob@@ struc@@ t justice .
&quot; Seri@@ ous alleg@@ ations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved , &quot; In@@ spec@@ tor General Gl@@ enn Fine said in his report .
The appointment of a special prosec@@ utor with the power to force witn@@ esses to t@@ esti@@ fy was one of his key recommendations .
The row began when nine US att@@ or@@ neys were removed from their positions by the US Department of Justice in December 2006 .
At the time , the department said that the att@@ or@@ neys had been fi@@ red for poor performance .
But it later emerged that the fi@@ red att@@ or@@ neys had not been rated any more poor@@ ly than many of their colleagues , leading many observers to conclude that the s@@ ack@@ ings had been poli@@ tic@@ ally-@@ motivated .
Some of the att@@ or@@ neys had been involved in the prosec@@ ution of high-@@ profile Republic@@ an members of Congress , while others had refused to investigate alleg@@ ations of vot@@ er fraud against Democrats .
US att@@ or@@ neys investigate and prosec@@ ute court cases for the government .
They can be dis@@ missed at any time , but may not be removed for political reasons .
The then head of the justice department , Att@@ or@@ ney General Alber@@ to Gonz@@ ales , came under fire for the s@@ ack@@ ings , and eventually resign@@ ed his position .
A number of other justice department officials also resign@@ ed .
The inspec@@ tor general &apos;s report was highly critical of Mr Gonz@@ ales &apos;s role in the affair , saying he b@@ ore &quot; primary responsibility &quot; for the s@@ ack@@ ings , that he &quot; ab@@ dic@@ ated &quot; his leadership role and was &quot; remark@@ ably un@@ engaged &quot; in the process .
Other officials , including former senior Bush ai@@ de Karl Ro@@ ve , were criticised for failing to co-@@ operate with the investigation .
Me@@ at Lo@@ af &apos;s ep@@ ic to be hon@@ oured
Rock star Me@@ at Lo@@ af is to be hon@@ oured at the Q Awards for his ep@@ ic an@@ them B@@ at Out Of H@@ ell .
The singer , who will collect his special golden award at next week &apos;s ceremony in London , said he was &quot; hon@@ oured &quot; to gain recognition .
The song , which la@@ sts nine minutes and fif@@ ty seconds , was the title track to Me@@ at Lo@@ af &apos;s hit 1977 album .
Col@@ d@@ play are leading the nom@@ inations for this year &apos;s awards , making the short@@ lists of four categories .
Paul Re@@ es , Q magazine &apos;s edi@@ tor@@ -in-@@ chief , said : &quot; There are some songs that tran@@ sc@@ end such things as time and gen@@ re , and B@@ at Out Of H@@ ell is ass@@ ur@@ edly one of them . &quot;
The song , p@@ enn@@ ed by J@@ im Stein@@ man , required a huge vocal which was delivered by Me@@ at Lo@@ af .
It opened with an instru@@ mental section which la@@ sted almost two minutes .
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and pe@@ aked at number 15 .
But Me@@ at Lo@@ af &apos;s B@@ at Out Of H@@ ell album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide .
Me@@ at Lo@@ af - real name Mar@@ vin Lee A@@ day - has suffered health problems in recent years , including surgery for an ir@@ regular hear@@ t@@ beat in 2003 after collap@@ sing on stage .
In 2007 , acute lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis forced him to cancel concerts .
It later emerged that he had a cy@@ st on his vocal ch@@ ord .
Ob@@ sc@@ ure City Street , O@@ ften For@@ gotten and Perhaps So@@ on for S@@ ale
New York City has thousands of aven@@ ues , bou@@ lev@@ ards , streets and other by@@ ways , some famous , others merely utili@@ t@@ arian .
But even many veter@@ an taxi drivers and long@@ time local residents find it difficult to give the location of Ex@@ tra Place , mostly because they have never heard of it .
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bo@@ wer@@ y and Second Avenue .
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long , it res@@ emb@@ les a du@@ sty alle@@ y@@ way more than an active thorou@@ gh@@ fare .
There are no street signs .
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard at@@ las .
The street does , however , have admir@@ ers .
For instance , there is A@@ val@@ on Bay , the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street .
It wants to re@@ pa@@ ve Ex@@ tra Place and create a clean@@ er pass@@ age@@ way to the shops and bou@@ tiques that are expected to open in the new buildings .
Other admir@@ ers include long@@ time neigh@@ b@@ ors who said they were char@@ med by the tr@@ unc@@ ated lan@@ e simply because it was one of the last rem@@ n@@ ants of the block &apos;s pre@@ gent@@ ri@@ fied past .
But the city &apos;s Department of H@@ ous@@ ing Pres@@ er@@ vation and Development , which has control of the street , has no interest in holding on to it .
At a meeting of the neighborhood community board &apos;s land use committee this month , representatives of the city agency and A@@ val@@ on Bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street .
But the committee pre@@ fers that the street remain in the city &apos;s hands , and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month , said Sus@@ an St@@ etz@@ er , the district manager of Community Board 3 .
&quot; There &apos;s very little c@@ ity-@@ owned space left , and we would like the city to continue to own Ex@@ tra Place , &quot; she said .
&quot; There could be proposals to fix it up and manage it , which could be done by A@@ val@@ on , but we also want to guarantee public access . &quot;
A@@ val@@ on Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to re@@ pa@@ ve the little street and install seats , including some to be used by a caf@@ e to which the developer expects to le@@ ase space .
The idea that A@@ val@@ on Bay might buy the street was first made public at this month &apos;s meeting .
Mich@@ ele de Mil@@ ly , a spo@@ kes@@ woman for A@@ val@@ on Bay , said that though the company wanted to use the street , it did not necessarily want to own it .
&quot; A@@ val@@ on Bay &apos;s principal concern is refur@@ bish@@ ing this der@@ el@@ ic@@ t alle@@ y@@ way and turning it into a public amen@@ ity , &quot; she said , adding that the city had suggested the sale .
Se@@ th Don@@ lin , a spo@@ kes@@ man for H@@ ous@@ ing Pres@@ er@@ vation , said it was indeed the city &apos;s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency &apos;s mission was to develop property rather than manage it .
Compar@@ ed with its more color@@ ful neigh@@ bor , the Bo@@ wer@@ y , Ex@@ tra Place has left a light historical foot@@ print .
Some believe it got its name in 18@@ 02 , when a large farm owned by Phili@@ p Min@@ thor@@ ne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unc@@ laimed .
The back door of C@@ B@@ GB , the pun@@ k rock monument that closed in 2006 , opened onto Ex@@ tra Place , and the street is perhaps best known as the setting for the cover phot@@ ograph of the Ram@@ ones &apos; album &quot; Ro@@ cket to Russia . &quot;
&quot; The ground was magnificent , &quot; said D@@ ann@@ y F@@ iel@@ ds , the manager of the Ram@@ ones , who took the phot@@ ograph in November 1976 .
&quot; It was filled with j@@ unk , sh@@ reds of clothes and pieces of bar@@ rel@@ s , post@@ ers , leaves , ro@@ pes . &quot;
Some residents , including blo@@ gg@@ ers who write about the gent@@ ri@@ fication of the East Village , have opposed the idea of selling Ex@@ tra Place , argu@@ ing that the piece of public property , modest as it is , should remain public .
Others have lau@@ ded Ex@@ tra Place as a r@@ arity - a virtually un@@ changed sli@@ ver of the city that ought to be left alone .
Jer@@ emi@@ ah Mo@@ ss , who runs a blog called Jer@@ emi@@ ah &apos;s Van@@ ishing New York ( sub@@ ti@@ tled , &quot; The Book of L@@ ament@@ ations : A Bit@@ terly No@@ st@@ alg@@ ic Look at a City in the Process of Go@@ ing Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t &quot; ) , posted part of a Tal@@ k of the Town story about Ex@@ tra Place that appeared in The New Yor@@ ker in 195@@ 2 .
The author , Br@@ end@@ an G@@ ill , wrote : &quot; Ex@@ tra Place is a narrow little dead@@ -@@ end street , dark even by day and marked off by ru@@ sty iron wareh@@ ouse doors and sh@@ ut@@ tered windows , with week@@ -@@ old newspapers b@@ lowing along the gut@@ ters . &quot;
With a few exceptions , the street looked much the same on a recent evening .
A rat sk@@ it@@ tered across the back of the street near a door that used to lead into C@@ B@@ GB , which is now the site of an up@@ scale clothing store .
Gra@@ ff@@ iti was on walls and an empty 2@@ 2-@@ ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh bat@@ ch of dis@@ car@@ ded newspapers .
A few p@@ asser@@ s@@ by said that they rarely thought about Ex@@ tra Place but suggested that it could use some spru@@ cing up .
Mr. F@@ iel@@ ds , for his part , said he thought that some people were under@@ estim@@ ating the appeal of the street in its current state .
&quot; The best years of my life , &quot; he said , &quot; were in places that were dark , dam@@ p and dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
The Bil@@ ing@@ ual Deb@@ ate : English Immer@@ sion
In this install@@ ment of Education Watch , Bru@@ ce Ful@@ ler and L@@ ance T. I@@ zu@@ mi discuss the candidates &apos; positions on bil@@ ing@@ ual education .
L@@ ance T. I@@ zu@@ mi , a senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy , is the co-@@ author of the book &quot; Not as Good as You Th@@ ink : Why the Middle Class Ne@@ eds School Cho@@ ice . &quot;
Making effective appe@@ als to His@@ pan@@ ic voters is a tri@@ cky business .
Barack Obama &apos;s education proposals are a case in point .
Mr. Obama &apos;s campaign notes that , &quot; Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American and Lat@@ ino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students , &quot; which is true .
To combat such achievement gaps , Mr. Obama &apos;s education plan specifically advocates , among other things , &quot; transitional bil@@ ing@@ ual education &quot; for Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ lear@@ ners .
Yet , the question for Mr. Obama is whether his commitment to bil@@ ing@@ ual education , which empha@@ sizes class@@ room instruction in languages other than English , over@@ ri@@ des his interest in closing achievement gaps .
Take , for example , Six@@ th Street Pre@@ p , a charter el@@ ementary school in eastern Los Angeles County .
The school &apos;s students are overwhel@@ m@@ ingly His@@ pan@@ ic and low income .
More than a third of the students , many of whom are recent arri@@ vals , are learning English .
Yet , among fourth gra@@ ders , an ast@@ o@@ und@@ ing 100 percent of the students tested at the pro@@ fic@@ ient level on the 2008 state math ex@@ am .
A nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth gra@@ ders tested pro@@ fic@@ ient on the state Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ langu@@ age-@@ arts ex@@ am .
This incredible success was achieved using a different ing@@ re@@ dient than the one favor@@ ed by Mr. Obama .
Six@@ th Street empha@@ sizes review and practice , constant assessment of skills and a no-@@ exc@@ uses attitude .
Furthermore , and here &apos;s where Mr. Obama should take note , according to Lin@@ da Mi@@ k@@ els , Six@@ th Street &apos;s principal , the school &apos;s instruc@@ tional approach for English lear@@ ners is &quot; full immer@@ sion . &quot;
English immer@@ sion empha@@ sizes the near@@ -@@ exclusive use of English in content instruction .
M@@ s. Mi@@ k@@ els , who op@@ poses bil@@ ing@@ ual education , told me , &quot; we &apos;ve had tremendous success with having a student who is brand new from Mexico and you would walk into a class@@ room 12 months later and you w@@ ouldn &apos;t be able to pick out which one he was . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s working , &quot; she observed , &quot; it &apos;s working for us . &quot;
Would Mr. Obama hold up a school like Six@@ th Street Pre@@ p as one model for rep@@ lication by other schools with large His@@ pan@@ ic and Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ lear@@ ner populations ?
The school &apos;s achievement results should make the answer to that question a no-@@ bra@@ iner , but the education politics within his own party ( the National Education Associ@@ ations has been a long-@@ time suppor@@ ter of bil@@ ing@@ ual education ) and his own consistent support for bil@@ ing@@ ual education ob@@ sc@@ ure predic@@ ting Mr. Obama &apos;s response .
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English , Mr. Obama recently tri@@ vi@@ alized the issue when he said that people should stop worrying about &quot; Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ only &quot; legislation .
Instead , he said , &quot; you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish . &quot;
If Mr. Obama truly wishes to close achievement gaps , he should carefully consider education models that work rather than sc@@ orn or tri@@ vi@@ alize them .
Oil Falls Shar@@ p@@ ly on Ren@@ ew@@ ed Economic F@@ ears
Oil prices dropped sharp@@ ly on Monday because of concerns that even the American b@@ ail@@ out plan for the financial markets may fail to revi@@ ve the economy .
Cru@@ de oil fut@@ ures fell as much as 7 percent to $ 9@@ 9.@@ 80 a bar@@ rel on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange in morning trading .
Prices have lost more than $ 20 a bar@@ rel since last Monday .
In the last two weeks , commodity markets have been sha@@ ken by the financial tur@@ mo@@ il on Wall Street , and a pair of powerful hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es in the Gulf of Mexico .
After reaching a high of $ 14@@ 5.@@ 29 a bar@@ rel in July , prices had fallen to nearly $ 90 a bar@@ rel earlier this month , before once again j@@ umping back up on the back of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets .
An@@ x@@ i@@ ety gri@@ pped investors once again on Monday even after Con@@ gres@@ sional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the b@@ ail@@ out plan , the largest in history .
The news was over@@ shad@@ owed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over .
In the latest episode of the un@@ fol@@ ding mel@@ t@@ down , Ci@@ tig@@ ro@@ up will buy the banking operations of the Wach@@ o@@ via Corporation , the government said Monday .
Meanwhile , the Belgian , Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nation@@ alized the European financial con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ate For@@ tis .
An@@ alyst@@ s at Bar@@ cla@@ ys Capital said the fran@@ tic weekend negotiations that led to the b@@ ail@@ out agreement &quot; appear to have failed to revi@@ ve market sen@@ timent . &quot;
As the economic situation deterior@@ ates , the demand for commodities , including oil , is expected to slow down .
&quot; The outlook for global equity , interest rate and exchange rate markets has become increasingly uncertain , &quot; an@@ alyst@@ s at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors .
&quot; We believe commodities will be unable to escape the cont@@ ag@@ ion .
From a commodity perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the US virus spre@@ ads globally and specifically to China . &quot;
The bank &apos;s an@@ alyst@@ s par@@ ed down their expectations for next year as oil consumption dro@@ ps because of s@@ lowing economic growth , reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009 .
Sec@@ on@@ d-@@ Quar@@ ter Sp@@ ree S@@ ets Team Rec@@ ord
After spending more time in a J@@ ets uniform the last eigh@@ t-@@ plus seasons than anyone , def@@ ensive end Sh@@ au@@ n El@@ lis thought he had seen it all .
Then he wat@@ ched the second quarter un@@ fold Sunday , when the J@@ ets transformed a sc@@ or@@ eless game into a b@@ low@@ out .
&quot; N@@ ever seen anything quite like that , &quot; El@@ lis said .
The second quarter began after the J@@ ets and the Ari@@ zona Car@@ din@@ als had matched the glo@@ om@@ y clou@@ ds hang@@ ing over@@ head with sl@@ opp@@ y play .
Then quar@@ ter@@ back Bre@@ tt F@@ av@@ re found La@@ veran@@ ues Col@@ es for a 12-@@ yard tou@@ ch@@ down strike , providing the perfect har@@ b@@ inger for an afternoon when their evol@@ ving connection took a giant le@@ ap forward .
F@@ av@@ re found Col@@ es for two more tou@@ ch@@ down@@ s in the quarter , including one when a cor@@ ner@@ back fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the half .
&quot; I didn &apos;t go out of my way , &quot; F@@ av@@ re said of all the passes that went to Col@@ es .
&quot; He &apos;s a hell of a player .
Our communication has been great , regardless of what people may think . &quot;
While F@@ av@@ re and Col@@ es played catch , the defense batter@@ ed Car@@ din@@ als quar@@ ter@@ back Kur@@ t War@@ ner .
Cor@@ ner@@ back Dar@@ rel@@ le Rev@@ is inter@@ cep@@ ted an err@@ ant throw and returned it 32 yards for a tou@@ ch@@ down .
Safety Eric Smith ti@@ pped another pass and inter@@ cep@@ ted it .
Lin@@ eb@@ ack@@ er David Bow@@ ens forced a f@@ um@@ ble by War@@ ner .
The last turnover , the f@@ um@@ ble forced by Bow@@ ens , might have been the most eg@@ regi@@ ous .
The Car@@ din@@ als had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left , and after the J@@ ets recover@@ ed the ball , J@@ ay Fe@@ ely k@@ ic@@ ked a 20-@@ yard field goal for a 3@@ 4-@@ 0 lead .
It was the most the J@@ ets had ever sc@@ ored in a quarter .
A@@ sk@@ ed to describe the cra@@ zin@@ ess of it , J@@ ets Co@@ ach Eric Mang@@ ini said , &quot; The second quarter or the third quarter ? &quot;
When he was told both - the J@@ ets allowed 21 un@@ answered points in the third quarter - Mang@@ ini said : &quot; I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than I did the third quarter .
There were a lot of points sc@@ ored in a short amount of time . &quot;
Rest@@ ed Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie T@@ ops His World Rec@@ ord
Ha@@ ile Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie of Ethi@@ opia again showed why many consider him the greatest distance run@@ ner ever , breaking his own world record in the mar@@ athon in Berlin on Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 2@@ 6.@@ 2-@@ mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes .
With a victory on the accomm@@ o@@ dat@@ ingly flat course in 2 : 03 : 59 , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie sh@@ attered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2 : 04 : 26 , run last year in Berlin .
At 35 , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie set the 26@@ th world record of a career of such stunning b@@ read@@ th that he has produced a world champ@@ ionship or world record at every distance from the met@@ ric mile to the mar@@ athon .
Last month , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie ski@@ pped the Olympic mar@@ athon in Beijing , fear@@ ing - perhaps too alarm@@ ingly , in retro@@ sp@@ ect - that the air pollution would exacerb@@ ate his problems with as@@ th@@ ma .
Instead , he signed to run in Berlin .
In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start , 55 degrees at the finish - Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie won Sunday while aver@@ aging a bli@@ stering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile .
As track run@@ ners like Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie and Paul T@@ erg@@ at of Kenya have turned to longer distances , the record for the mar@@ athon has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade , since Ron@@ al@@ do da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2 : 06 : 05 in 1998 .
After Sunday &apos;s victory , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie told re@@ por@@ ters that he had cr@@ amps in his cal@@ f two weeks ago and had missed a week of training .
Clearly , the lay@@ off left him fresh , not ru@@ sty .
&quot; I &apos;m so happy , &quot; Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie told re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; Everything was perfect .
I started again a week ago , and had some doubts today , but in the end everything was fine . &quot;
He has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya , Ethi@@ opia &apos;s East African ri@@ val - for over@@ ly or@@ chest@@ rating his races , generally avoiding many of the world &apos;s top mar@@ athon stars , rel@@ ying on pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers as if it were a track race , and placing world records ahead of a sense of competition .
But this criticism hardly dimin@@ ishes the great@@ ness of Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie &apos;s skill as a distance run@@ ner .
P@@ ac@@ ed by four Ken@@ y@@ ans on Sunday , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie reached the mid@@ way point in 1 : 02 : 04 .
Two elite Ken@@ yan run@@ ners , James K@@ w@@ amb@@ ai and Charles Kam@@ ath@@ i , kept challenging Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie after the pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers f@@ aded .
A little more than three miles from the finish , Geb@@ r@@ sel@@ as@@ sie made a final sur@@ ge to separate from K@@ w@@ amb@@ ai , who finished second in 2 : 05 : 36 , improving his personal best by nearly five minutes .
Kam@@ ath@@ i took third in 2 : 07 : 48 .
In the women &apos;s race , I@@ rin@@ a Mi@@ kit@@ enko , a native of Kaz@@ ak@@ h@@ stan who is now a German citizen , completed a remarkable year by winning in 2 : 19 : 19 , the sev@@ enth@@ -@@ fastest time ever .
Pau@@ la Rad@@ cli@@ ff@@ e of Great Britain holds the world record of 2 : 15 : 25 .
Last spring , Mi@@ kit@@ enko , 36 , was a surprise winner of the London Mar@@ athon in 2 : 24 : 14 .
She missed the Beijing Games with what was described as a back injury , but recover@@ ed to win in Berlin , setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third mar@@ athon she has run .
She ran a race of smart calculation , letting a quar@@ tet of Ethi@@ op@@ ian and Ken@@ yan run@@ ners break out to a wide lead , then re@@ eling them after about 18 ½ miles .
A@@ sk@@ ale T@@ af@@ a Mag@@ ar@@ sa of Ethi@@ opia took second in 2 : 21.@@ 31 , while Hel@@ ena Ki@@ pro@@ p of Kenya finished third in 2 : 25 : 01 .
In a Town Apart , the Pri@@ de and Tri@@ als of Black Life
Hi@@ dden in the them@@ e-@@ park spra@@ w@@ l of greater Or@@ land@@ o , a few miles from the sh@@ iny , the loud and the gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an , lies a quiet town where the pride and complic@@ ations of the Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American experience come to life .
E@@ at@@ on@@ ville , the first all-@@ black town to incorporate in the country and the childhood home of Z@@ ora Ne@@ ale Hur@@ ston , is no longer as simple as she described it in 19@@ 35 : &quot; the city of five lakes , three cro@@ quet courts , 300 brown sk@@ ins , 300 good swi@@ mm@@ ers , plenty gu@@ av@@ as , two schools and no j@@ ail@@ house . &quot;
It is now a place of pilgri@@ ma@@ ge .
Ali@@ ce Wal@@ ker , T@@ oni Mor@@ ris@@ on and Ru@@ by D@@ ee have come to the annual Z@@ ora ! Festival in E@@ at@@ on@@ ville to pay their respects to Hur@@ ston , the most famous female writer of the Har@@ lem Renaissance .
And yet in many ways , the town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ -@@ era Federal Writ@@ ers &apos; Project - remains a place apart .
It is as independent , dig@@ ni@@ fied and private as it was in the 1930@@ s , when Hur@@ ston wrote that rural bl@@ acks in Florida often resist@@ ed sharing their true thoughts with the white man , who &quot; knowing so little about us , he doesn &apos;t know what he is missing . &quot;
Even now , in a year when a black presidential nomin@@ ee , Sen@@ ator Barack Obama , has called for an open conversation about race , many here remain war@@ y of the out@@ si@@ der &apos;s ga@@ ze .
&quot; We &apos;re very cau@@ tious about how our story is told , &quot; said Hor@@ ten@@ se Jones , 59 , a lifelong resident and member of the town &apos;s oldest church .
&quot; It needs to be right . &quot;
E@@ at@@ on@@ ville has long been defined as a parad@@ ox of tri@@ umph and struggle .
It is both a historic model of black em@@ power@@ ment and a community of nearly 2,@@ 400 where the poverty rates are twice the national average .
It is a literary hub but also an o@@ ak@@ -@@ sha@@ ded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes dis@@ da@@ ined , sometimes pra@@ ised - that was born of American sla@@ very .
Not surpris@@ ingly , residents here are both proud and protective .
And the concern about E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s image really began with Z@@ ora , which is all anyone here calls Hur@@ ston .
She introduced the world to her hom@@ et@@ own through hear@@ t@@ felt , dial@@ ec@@ t-@@ heavy books like &quot; M@@ ules and Men &quot; ( 19@@ 35 ) and &quot; Their E@@ yes W@@ ere Wat@@ ching God &quot; ( 19@@ 37 ) .
Five paragraphs in the Florida gu@@ ide@@ book transformed the town , just off Route 17 , a road that runs through the of@@ t-@@ forgotten center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama .
B@@ old as a bass drum in both life and literature , Hur@@ ston led readers to the store owned by E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s first may@@ or , Jo@@ e Clar@@ ke , then ve@@ ered into more private areas .
&quot; O@@ ff the road on the left , &quot; she wrote , &quot; is the brow@@ n-@@ with@@ -@@ wh@@ it@@ e-@@ tri@@ m modern public school , with its well-@@ kept yards and play@@ grounds , which How@@ ard Mill@@ er always looks after , though he can scar@@ c@@ ely read and write . &quot;
She also mentioned the new husband of Wi@@ dow D@@ ash and wrote that Lee Gl@@ enn &quot; s@@ ells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transi@@ ent rooms . &quot;
So in just a few hundred words , Hur@@ ston linked E@@ at@@ on@@ ville with self-@@ government but also illi@@ ter@@ acy , re@@ marriage and sex .
Clearly , F@@ od@@ or &apos;s this was not .
In fact , it was not a portra@@ it everyone appreciated .
&quot; Z@@ ora told it like it was , &quot; said Ell@@ a D@@ ink@@ ins , 90 , one of the John@@ son girls Hur@@ ston im@@ mort@@ alized by quot@@ ing men singing off-@@ color songs about their beauty .
She added : &quot; Some people didn &apos;t like that . &quot;
Hur@@ ston is still remembered here as a vi@@ v@@ acious ec@@ cent@@ ric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jack@@ son@@ ville , F@@ la .
August@@ us Frank@@ lin , 77 , rec@@ alled that when Hur@@ ston sp@@ ed into town , she usually arrived without notice in a th@@ umping Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let , smoking and wearing p@@ ants in a town that even today pri@@ des itself on dig@@ ni@@ fied dress .
Most residents were fascin@@ ated , Mr. Frank@@ lin said , while many s@@ ne@@ ered .
&quot; People were always glad to see Z@@ ora , &quot; Mr. Frank@@ lin said .
But , he added , ro@@ cking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Lake Sab@@ el@@ ia , where Hur@@ ston was most likely b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed , &quot; she never did stay too long . &quot;
When Hur@@ ston died in 1960 , she was poor and her books had fallen out of print .
Along with much of the world , E@@ at@@ on@@ ville seemed to have forgotten her .
Though she was once a literary star , a contemporary of Lang@@ ston Hu@@ gh@@ es and the only black woman at Bar@@ n@@ ard College in the 19@@ 20@@ s , she was bur@@ ied in an un@@ marked grave in Fort Pier@@ ce , F@@ la . , where she had been living .
In E@@ at@@ on@@ ville , there were no major mem@@ orial services , no grand public read@@ ings .
&quot; I don &apos;t think they understood her contribution to the world or her legacy at all , &quot; said Val@@ erie Bo@@ y@@ d , author of &quot; W@@ ra@@ pped in Rain@@ b@@ ows , &quot; a Hur@@ ston bi@@ ography published in 2003 .
A turning point came in the 1980s .
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-@@ lan@@ e highway through town to replace Kenne@@ dy Bou@@ levard , the community &apos;s put@@ tering two-@@ lan@@ e main street .
Or@@ land@@ o &apos;s spra@@ w@@ l had already pushed Inter@@ state 4 through the western edge of town .
The proposal came as E@@ at@@ on@@ ville was still recover@@ ing from a difficult period in its history .
For@@ ced integration , among other things , had ended the community &apos;s relatively idyllic isolation .
In the 1950@@ s , the fight over ra@@ cial mixing brought h@@ ate to the community &apos;s door@@ step .
&quot; During that time , a b@@ unch of white boys , they would come through and throw or@@ an@@ ges and things at people sitting down on the side , &quot; Mr. Frank@@ lin said .
&quot; We actually had a lady that got killed from that once .
They thre@@ w a water@@ mel@@ on out of the car . &quot;
In a 195@@ 5 letter to The Or@@ land@@ o S@@ ent@@ in@@ el , Hur@@ ston ques@@ tioned the Supreme Court &apos;s demand for forced integration , calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education &quot; ins@@ ul@@ ting rather than hon@@ oring my race . &quot;
Res@@ idents now say that the des@@ eg@@ reg@@ ation of schools , while positive in some respects , dil@@ uted E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s cohes@@ i@@ veness and undermined the confidence of its youth .
&quot; Black children were accu@@ stom@@ ed to being hu@@ g@@ ged - I remember this - you hu@@ g@@ ged your teacher in the morning , you hu@@ g@@ ged your teacher at night , &quot; said N@@ . Y@@ . N@@ ath@@ i@@ ri , the daughter of Ell@@ a D@@ ink@@ ins and the executive director of Pres@@ er@@ ve the E@@ at@@ on@@ ville Community , a non@@ profit group .
That la@@ sted , she added , until the teachers and students did not come from the same place .
&quot; You were not hu@@ gging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there &apos;s a cultural divide there , &quot; M@@ s. N@@ ath@@ i@@ ri said .
Civil rights , however , helped create space for many more Z@@ ora Ne@@ ale Hur@@ st@@ ons - black writers , actors and artists who rose above prejudi@@ ce , like she did , with bu@@ o@@ y@@ ant self-@@ assurance and lines like : &quot; How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company !
It &apos;s beyond me . &quot;
In 1975 , the writer Ali@@ ce Wal@@ ker tre@@ k@@ ked to Hur@@ ston &apos;s un@@ marked grave and began fighting to res@@ ur@@ rec@@ t her reputation .
Five years later , an acc@@ laimed Hur@@ ston bi@@ ography by Robert E. H@@ emen@@ way hit book@@ shel@@ ves , re@@ introducing her to the American can@@ on .
The highway project arrived just as E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s most famous daughter had once again found the spot@@ light .
And this time , Hur@@ ston &apos;s old neigh@@ b@@ ors saw her as a sa@@ vi@@ or .
The community began planning in 1988 for a Hur@@ ston festival to show what the county could ru@@ in with its highway .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of fans came to the inau@@ g@@ ural event two years later , and each January , many return for the celebration .
After several years , the county backed away from its road proposal .
&quot; The five-@@ lan@@ ing of the highway res@@ ur@@ rec@@ ted , it put in what you &apos;d call war@@ p speed , real civi@@ c pride , &quot; M@@ s. N@@ ath@@ i@@ ri said .
M@@ s. Bo@@ y@@ d put it more simply : &quot; Z@@ ora saved E@@ at@@ on@@ ville . &quot;
Vic@@ tory over the highway project has helped change the town &apos;s self-@@ image .
Out@@ -@@ of-@@ t@@ owners like R@@ ach@@ elle M@@ uns@@ on , a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993 , started to appear in larger numbers , and residents started to re@@ value the past .
E@@ at@@ on@@ ville joined the national historic regi@@ stry in 1998 .
A new one-@@ story library ( named after Hur@@ ston , of course ) opened in 2006 on a rep@@ aved and beauti@@ fied Kenne@@ dy Bou@@ levard .
Today , E@@ at@@ on@@ ville remains a Florida an@@ om@@ al@@ y : only six miles from downtown Or@@ land@@ o , it can , at times , feel like a back street in a summer rain , as small as it did when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 18@@ 8@@ 0s .
( It is 90 percent black today . )
Out@@ si@@ ders who come looking for E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s story , its meaning , are often still treated with caution .
Adv@@ ance permission is required for most interviews , and certain things - like the mur@@ als at E@@ at@@ on@@ ville &apos;s oldest church , painted by a white man , showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photograph@@ ed .
Many in E@@ at@@ on@@ ville , like M@@ s. Jones , a bold , confident teacher partial to bright red , still fear that their ins@@ ular community will be mis@@ understood .
And yet , as the Hur@@ ston festival has expanded , a hei@@ gh@@ tened level of hom@@ et@@ own pride has also emerged .
Young people , in particular , tend to see E@@ at@@ on@@ ville as Hur@@ ston saw her entire race : beautiful , problems and all , no better , no worse and as proud , creative , hard-@@ working , sil@@ ly and mix@@ ed@@ -up as other ra@@ cial and ethnic groups in America .
It is sincere civi@@ c aff@@ ection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Frank@@ lin &apos;s ne@@ ph@@ e@@ w , Ed@@ win Harv@@ ey , 18 , who plans to come back to E@@ at@@ on@@ ville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department , which he said could use some help .
And even those who are younger , like Al@@ on@@ dr@@ a and Alex@@ ia Ken@@ on , 11-@@ year-old tw@@ ins from Winter Park , seem to have learned to describe E@@ at@@ on@@ ville correctly .
&quot; Most people , if they just drive through here , they &apos;ll think , &apos; O@@ h , this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones , &apos; &quot; Al@@ on@@ dr@@ a Ken@@ on said after church on a recent Sunday .
&quot; But if you actually stop and take a moment to look at the history , it &apos;s a very nice city . &quot;
Over here in New York we all speak flu@@ ent finance
On the face of it , nothing has changed .
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from news@@ stands and the gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an television screens in Times Square , they w@@ ouldn &apos;t realise they were standing in the eye of a storm .
They would never gu@@ ess that in the gl@@ ass@@ -@@ fron@@ ted , hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b offices above their heads the ban@@ kers and h@@ edge fund managers who mon@@ opoli@@ se New York are daily having the worst &quot; bad day at the office &quot; since the crash of 19@@ 29 .
Deli@@ very boys still r@@ attle metal tea trol@@ leys across side@@ walks , fer@@ rying tra@@ ys of mu@@ ff@@ ins for breakfast meetings .
Lat@@ ino men still sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le between apartment buildings carrying , like human m@@ ules , 50-@@ od@@ d pressed shi@@ rts hang@@ ing from a yo@@ ke across their shoul@@ ders .
Office workers still wait in line for their morning bag@@ el at p@@ av@@ ement food car@@ ts , and it is still impossible to get a yellow c@@ ab between 4@@ pm and 7@@ pm on a week@@ day .
It didn &apos;t feel as if there was a crisis at all , until , with all the talk of d@@ oom and glo@@ om , I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon .
Even though I had tim@@ ed the ch@@ ore to coinci@@ de with the late afternoon l@@ ull at my local branch of J@@ P Morgan Ch@@ ase , a qu@@ eu@@ e of 20 or so people was already waiting in line .
Not in front of the t@@ eller windows , to withdraw cash or make a deposit , but in front of the customer service desk , where older clients order che@@ que books , tourists ask for directions to M@@ acy &apos;s department store and new customers open accounts .
Most of those ahead of me , I was to learn later from Star@@ r , my &quot; licensed personal ban@@ ker &quot; , were lining up for the same reason as me .
Unlike me , however , they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they comm@@ uted , from the likes of New Jer@@ sey , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania and St@@ aten Island .
They had taken out money from so-called th@@ rif@@ ts ( a bit like a building society ) , credit unions and the type of hom@@ et@@ own savings banks whose branches only operate within one state , and who say they treat customers like family .
In the past year , 15 of these banks have quiet@@ ly gone b@@ ust .
In the last few days Washington Mut@@ ual , a bank with $ 3@@ 27 billion of assets , went into recei@@ ver@@ ship , and as New Yor@@ kers headed home for the weekend on Friday night , another bank , Wach@@ o@@ via , with savings deposits of $ 4@@ 40 billion , was on the h@@ unt for a rescue buyer .
The office and shop workers standing in front of me , scar@@ ed of another collapse , were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be a safe haven , the bank that is doing most of the b@@ ailing out on Wall Street .
Ord@@ inary New Yor@@ kers in the last few weeks have become flu@@ ent in finance .
A woman at my local Chinese super@@ market , speaking into her phone , referred to Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers , the b@@ ust bank , and its ga@@ un@@ t-@@ looking chief executive D@@ ick Ful@@ d with all the famili@@ arity as if she were bit@@ ching about an id@@ le colleague .
And Ly@@ n , the uni@@ formed , fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ something conci@@ er@@ ge of my apartment block , has changed t@@ ack from our normal topic of conversation about Bra@@ d and Angel@@ ina or my gro@@ cer@@ y delivery .
She told me , after my visit to the bank , that &quot; I got all my savings in money market funds now .
I &apos;ve swit@@ ched , I &apos;m not taking any risks . &quot;
Muslim gra@@ ves des@@ ec@@ rated as Austria sw@@ ings to the right
Hein@@ z-@@ Christian Stra@@ che , left of the Austrian right-@@ wing Austrian Freedom Party and Fili@@ p De@@ winter of Belgian right wing party V@@ la@@ ams Bel@@ ang , take part in a manifest@@ ation to present the organisation of &quot; Ci@@ ties against Islam@@ isation &quot; in Ant@@ wer@@ p , Thursday 17 January 2008 .
They carry traff@@ ic-@@ style signs depic@@ ting mos@@ ques with a red line running through .
Police are bl@@ aming far Right extrem@@ ists for des@@ ec@@ rating a Muslim c@@ emet@@ ery in Austria , the same weekend that the political parties of the far Right made huge gains in the country &apos;s general election .
Over 90 gra@@ ves were severely damaged at the c@@ emet@@ ery in Trau@@ n , near Linz , some time between Friday night and this morning , in what police believe was an organised action .
The offen@@ ders spra@@ yed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some of the gra@@ ves , but det@@ ectives believe this may have been a bid to dis@@ gu@@ ise the mo@@ tives of extrem@@ ists driven by a hat@@ red of Muslim immigrants .
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the local Islamic Community said they were &quot; deeply sho@@ cked &quot; at the news of the des@@ ec@@ r@@ ation , which comes as the Muslim religious month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ne@@ ars its end .
Austria is mean@@ while embark@@ ing on a round of sou@@ l-@@ searching following its s@@ wing to the right in yesterday &apos;s parliamentary elections .
The two far-@@ Right parties that captured almost 30 percent of the vote , the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria , have campaign@@ ed on an veh@@ em@@ ently anti-@@ immigration ticket and some of their slo@@ gan@@ s were deemed xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic by critics .
Hein@@ z-@@ Christian Stra@@ che , the head of the Freedom Party that won over 18 per cent of the vote , campaign@@ ed against head@@ scar@@ ves and bur@@ kas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam .
At his final r@@ ally in Vienna , he spoke of a &quot; European bro@@ ther@@ hood &quot; to prevent the rise of Islam .
Both parties seek to ban the building of mos@@ ques and min@@ ar@@ ets , argu@@ ing that they were political symbols of an ongoing Islam@@ isation of Austria and Europe .
P@@ olls and analysis conducted immediately after the elections , which established the far Right as the country &apos;s strongest political blo@@ c , indicate that the change was brought about by predomin@@ ately young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union .
G@@ ary G@@ lit@@ ter banned from trip abroad
G@@ ary G@@ lit@@ ter , the gla@@ m rock star convic@@ ted of child sex abuse , has been banned by the courts from travelling to France and Spain .
Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ates imposed the six month ban on G@@ lit@@ ter after he informed the authorities monitoring him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France .
Police in K@@ ent were granted the foreign travel ban last Thursday after giving ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ates evidence of G@@ lit@@ ter &apos;s previous convic@@ tions for child sex abuse .
G@@ lit@@ ter , real name , Paul G@@ add , did not attend the hearing at Ash@@ ford Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ates court in K@@ ent but he was represented by so@@ lic@@ it@@ ors Cor@@ ker B@@ inning .
A Court Service spo@@ kes@@ man said : &quot; On Thursday September 25 at Ash@@ ford Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ates &apos; Court , K@@ ent Police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to France and Spain until March 25 by Mr Paul G@@ add .
&quot; Paul G@@ add did not attend in person . &quot;
G@@ lit@@ ter , 64 , had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to under the sex offen@@ ders register .
He must give the authorities notice if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days .
He is also required to give police seven days notice of his planned departure date .
F@@ ail@@ ure to notify the authorities could lead to a five year prison sentence .
K@@ ent Police said they would not discuss individual cases or the possible wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs of G@@ lit@@ ter in the county .
A K@@ ent Police spo@@ kes@@ woman said : &quot; K@@ ent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country , or abroad .
&quot; From our point of view , it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risks more effectively .
&quot; Prot@@ ecting the residents of K@@ ent is the par@@ amount concern of K@@ ent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offen@@ ders in the county to minim@@ ise any risk to the public that may exist . &quot;
G@@ lit@@ ter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnam@@ ese j@@ ail for the abuse of two girls , aged 10 and 11 .
When he was fre@@ ed G@@ lit@@ ter fle@@ w to Bangkok where he was due to board a flight to London .
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London .
The Thai authorities would not allow him through passport control and he eventually fle@@ w to Hong Kong .
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he fle@@ w back to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insi@@ sted he return to Britain .
He eventually arrived at Heathrow &apos;s Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his so@@ lic@@ it@@ or David Cor@@ ker went to U@@ x@@ bridge Mag@@ i@@ str@@ ates Court , west London , as Scotland Y@@ ard successfully applied for an order requiring him to register as a sex off@@ ender .
G@@ lit@@ ter had previously been j@@ ailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for poss@@ essing images of child abuse .
A Home Office source said that J@@ acqu@@ i Smith , the Home Secretary was re@@ assured and glad that G@@ lit@@ ter has been stopped from travelling to France and Spain .
&quot; I phot@@ ograph the master away from the scene to extract his character &quot; Gün@@ ther Bauer , photographer
Neither he@@ els nor ru@@ ff@@ les or stage clothes .
Only the essence of the great masters of fl@@ amen@@ co , stri@@ pped of the concentration which character@@ iz@@ es the interpretation , to face a relaxed man or woman .
On one hand , the artist .
On the other , the person .
The two sides are in@@ separ@@ able , except in private life . In those moments , away from the public , the privacy of a gest@@ ure , the depth of a st@@ olen gl@@ ance or the expres@@ si@@ veness of the hands , are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage .
German Gün@@ ther Bauer , in the work &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ People &quot; , altern@@ ates the theat@@ ri@@ c@@ ality of some shots of sing@@ ers , dan@@ c@@ ers and gu@@ itar@@ ists on stage with these masters &apos; private and less known being .
This is the phot@@ ograph &apos;s aim when collecting an original i@@ con@@ ography of fl@@ amen@@ co , taken from different perspectives .
The exhibition , included in the Mon@@ th of Fl@@ amen@@ co Phot@@ ography &apos;s program , reflects the importance of international fl@@ amen@@ co , which increases day by day &quot; the artist explains . He also clari@@ fies that in &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ People &quot; even it should be ordinary people , going through the pictures , the observers get these are not the classic images of artists , interpre@@ ters or perform@@ ers on stage .
The people I portra@@ yed on the street &quot; are &quot; artists able to convey passion , s@@ ad@@ ness and joy when on stage ... and finally , to capture their audience .
To catch the personality of these artists taking pictures of the scene is over .
It is much more an inner personality and character .
I &apos;m very interested in creating an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the gre@@ ats of fl@@ amen@@ co by my camera . &quot;
Bauer began his path to portra@@ y sing@@ ers , gu@@ itar@@ ists and dan@@ c@@ ers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival &quot; Can@@ te de las Min@@ as &quot; . He likes to use a plate camera .
Due to the choice of the camera and the equipment , These portra@@ its remember the classic photos .
The application of different sty@@ li@@ stic techniques breaks with the i@@ con@@ ographic traditional principles , giving the photos modern@@ ity , as Bauer considers fl@@ amen@@ co : &quot; A music with very traditional roots which evol@@ ves and still sur@@ prises every day more . &quot;
It is not the dancing , the singing or the playing itself , but the artist &apos;s personality , his character , able to con@@ quer the audience through his art .
The search for a meeting with the essenti@@ ality , with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling , are and have been constant elements in this work , now on display at the gallery El Fot@@ ó@@ mat@@ a .
Fam@@ ous fl@@ amen@@ co artists such as Di@@ ego El C@@ ig@@ ala , Ch@@ an Lob@@ ato , Crist@@ ina Ho@@ y@@ os , En@@ ri@@ que Mor@@ ente , El Leb@@ ri@@ ja , Antonio Can@@ ales and Vic@@ ente Am@@ ig@@ o among others , are included in this selection of around s@@ event@@ y portra@@ yed artists .
The project has also become an an@@ th@@ ology of fl@@ amen@@ co , going to be published in a book which coll@@ ects the portra@@ its displayed at the exhibition .
The passion for the portra@@ it led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with &quot; Por@@ tra@@ its of veter@@ an ath@@ letes &quot; ( &quot; Sport@@ ART@@ project &quot; ) .
Although in &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ People &quot; the concept is different , the photographer ad@@ mits &quot; I love to portra@@ y people , to know them and to pen@@ et@@ rate into their lives for a while , being this a long or short moment .
I think portra@@ y is the most difficult subject in photography .
You meet or face people and characters sometimes you even know or persons who best@@ ow you only a few minutes to take the picture .
Beyond circumstances , as a photographer , I always try to realize my ideas . &quot;
The collection of portra@@ its of contemporary fl@@ amen@@ co , entitled &quot; Fl@@ amen@@ co-@@ people &quot; is exhi@@ bited at the gallery El Fot@@ ó@@ mat@@ a , Via de la Mat@@ a 20 , which is a parallel street to Al@@ am@@ eda de Her@@ cul@@ es . The exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of October .
Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a ad@@ mits the novel he &apos;s writing is a &quot; chance &quot;
The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject . Despite this , Mario Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a is stru@@ ggling with the new project he is working at , a novel whose prot@@ agon@@ ist , Rog@@ er Cas@@ em@@ ant , is an Irish nation@@ alist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and cross@@ ed Ama@@ zon .
The writer , always favoured for the Nobel Prize in Liter@@ ature , conf@@ essed yesterday during the H@@ ay Festival in Seg@@ o@@ via , that the draft he is dealing with is a &quot; chance &quot; and that everything indicates that I should not write it down . &quot;
&quot; If I had good sense , I do not write it at all , but I &apos;m going ahead anyway and I hope to finish it once and for all , &quot; he concluded his speech at this festival for the exchange of ideas , thoughts and words that saw many guests , during the four days , passing by the Aqu@@ educ@@ t &apos;s city . H@@ und@@ reds of writers , hist@@ ori@@ ans and journalists and thousands of people joined it .
The author of &quot; La ci@@ u@@ dad y los per@@ ros &quot; was a prominent figure in the third edition of the word &apos;s festival , as forec@@ ast@@ ed .
Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a , who won the H@@ ay Festival prize being the most voted writer by participants - an ancient edition of &quot; Our mutual friend &quot; by D@@ ick@@ ens , packed the theatre Juan Bra@@ vo with fans .
In@@ tro@@ duced by F@@ é@@ li@@ x Rom@@ eo , the writer faced a public whose time fle@@ w away when the Peru@@ vian author , started to recall with a pro@@ di@@ gi@@ ous memory and with large do@@ ses of hum@@ our , the way he discovered his literary vocation , derived from the &quot; extraordinary adventure and the pleasure of reading . &quot; This is &quot; living beyond life &quot; , as he put it in . He explained why or@@ derly basis in writing permits &quot; to remove the lack of inspiration , &quot; through an intense work of documentation , editing and re@@ vising . He under@@ lined how F@@ aul@@ k@@ ner , Vic@@ tor Hu@@ go and Alexand@@ re D@@ um@@ as affected his vocation and said that the &quot; images of memory &quot; are the foundation from which his stories spring up .
The His@@ pan@@ ic-@@ American no@@ vel@@ ist , acknowledged that &quot; there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people &apos;s lives . I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and eph@@ emer@@ al entertainment experience , &quot; said Var@@ gas L@@ los@@ a who , also supported that &quot; the literature has a strong impact and pus@@ hes people to be non@@ con@@ form@@ ist . &quot; So he suggested the writers &quot; not to give into fri@@ vo@@ lity &quot; and to &quot; take the responsibility &quot; of their own vocation .
We@@ ather h@@ amp@@ ers the Po@@ z@@ ob@@ lan@@ co festival , which remains with no bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts
The bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts which were to seal the days of the festival of Po@@ z@@ ob@@ lan@@ co were suspended yesterday morning after the bul@@ l figh@@ ters had assured that the square &apos;s soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations .
Therefore , the company , together with Fer@@ min Boh@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , P@@ ab@@ lo Her@@ mo@@ so de M@@ end@@ o@@ za and Leonardo Her@@ nan@@ dez , decided to suspend the bul@@ l@@ fighting .
The weather was rather f@@ ier@@ ce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations .
Saturday , the rain had prevented the holding of the second bul@@ l@@ fight .
The b@@ ill@@ board included J@@ ose Lu@@ is Mor@@ eno , Cur@@ ro Di@@ az and Juan Bau@@ ti@@ sta , who would have faced a bul@@ l of Cas@@ til@@ blan@@ co .
So far , the only celebration took place on Friday .
This was the tri@@ umph of Daniel Lu@@ que , who cut three ears and was brought on shoul@@ ders after he had bul@@ l fought with taste and aes@@ the@@ tics .
The same afternoon A@@ le@@ j@@ and@@ ro Tal@@ av@@ ante completed his two bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and collected gre@@ etings and one ear , granted by the public more than by the quality of the bul@@ l@@ fight itself .
Among all , the worst was El Juli , who passed by the bul@@ l-@@ ring of Los L@@ lan@@ os gaining no gl@@ ory , no penalty .
With the second bul@@ l , after a tremendous mul@@ eta , he earned the boo@@ s of a bigger part of the public .
A van loaded with two thousand ki@@ los of h@@ ash@@ ish ski@@ ps a road block in Ala@@ va
Ten to six in the morning .
Traff@@ ic control by the Er@@ tz@@ ain@@ tz@@ a in the municipal district of Ar@@ mi@@ ñ@@ ón ( Ala@@ va ) .
The officials order the two occup@@ ants of a van to stop but they , instead , give to fle@@ e .
Their cargo , more than two tons of h@@ ash@@ ish , is a good reason for not st@@ opping .
The officers ch@@ ase after them , are succeed in arres@@ ting one over two occup@@ ants . The man , 28 years old , is identified as A. A. J. , as reported in a press release by the Department of the Inter@@ ior of the Basque Government .
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and for@@ gery of public documents .
This occurred when some officials of the Ala@@ va High@@ way Police were conducting an audit of transpor@@ ts along the N-@@ 1 , at the point which it cross@@ es the district town of Ar@@ mi@@ ñ@@ ón .
They were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver , bre@@ ached of the orders , sharp@@ ly acceler@@ ated and just ski@@ pped the road block .
The officials ch@@ ased the van until the vehicle stopped after a couple of miles on the edge of the road , and its two occup@@ ants fle@@ w into a woo@@ ded area .
The Er@@ tz@@ ain@@ tz@@ a officials managed to arrest one of the fu@@ gi@@ tives and , after the inspection of the van – an I@@ v@@ ec@@ o Da@@ ily , sei@@ zed 2@@ 17@@ 8 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of h@@ ash@@ ish .
The blocks of h@@ ash@@ ish , which were located in the rear of the vehicle , were subsequently placed under police cust@@ ody for a deep investigation and detection of weight .
Moreover , since officials found that the ch@@ assis number had been &quot; duplic@@ ated &quot; because it did not coinci@@ de with the one reported in the van &apos;s documentation , the arrested man was also charged for public documents &apos; fal@@ si@@ fication .
The Er@@ tz@@ ain@@ tz@@ a is continuing its investigations to arrest the second susp@@ ected person who managed to fle@@ e as mentioned above , and to determine the origin of sei@@ zed drugs .
The pris@@ oner , A. A. J. , 28 years old , was conducted to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures . He will be available to the court in the coming hours .
The act@@ ress He@@ ather Lock@@ le@@ ar arrested for driving while ad@@ dic@@ ted with drugs
The act@@ ress He@@ ather Lock@@ le@@ ar , Am@@ anda of the popular series Mel@@ rose Place , was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbar@@ a ( California ) after driving under the influence of drugs .
A witness viewed her performing inappropriate man@@ eu@@ vers while trying to take her car out from a parking in Mont@@ eci@@ to , as revealed to People magazine by a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Califor@@ ni@@ an High@@ way Police .
The witness stated that around 4.@@ 30@@ pm M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar &quot; crus@@ hed the acceler@@ ator very thoroughly , making excessive noise and trying to take the car out from the parking with ab@@ rupt back and forth man@@ eu@@ vers . By re@@ vers@@ ing , she passed several times in front of his s@@ ung@@ l@@ asses . &quot;
Sh@@ or@@ tly after , the witness , who , in a first time , apparently had not recognized the act@@ ress , saw M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar st@@ opping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle .
It was this person to alert the emergency services , because &quot; he was concerned about M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar &apos;s life . &quot;
When the pat@@ rol arrived , the police found the act@@ ress sitting inside her car , which was partially blocking the road .
&quot; She seemed confused , &quot; and for this reason the polic@@ emen led her to a specialized centre for drugs and alcohol and submitted her a test .
According to a spo@@ kes@@ man for the police , the act@@ ress has proven collabor@@ ative and the hypo@@ thesis of excessive alcohol was dis@@ car@@ ded since the very first moment , even if &quot; as the officers observed at first sight , we believe M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar was under the effect of any drug . &quot;
M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar was arrested under sus@@ pic@@ ion of driving under the influence of some - not better specified substance , and impris@@ oned in the local j@@ ail at 7.@@ 00@@ pm , to be released some hours later .
Two months ago , M@@ s. Lock@@ le@@ ar was out of a specialist clin@@ ic in Ari@@ zona where she was cur@@ ed after an episode of anx@@ i@@ ety and depression .
L@@ lam@@ az@@ ares ur@@ ges the Andalu@@ sian federation of I@@ U to assume its responsibilities in the Sil@@ va case
G@@ asp@@ ar L@@ lam@@ az@@ ares , the general coordin@@ ator of I@@ U and member of the party Iz@@ qu@@ ier@@ da Uni@@ da , confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or for Youth and Sport of the city of Si@@ vi@@ gli@@ a , Francisco Manuel Sil@@ va , who resign@@ ed last week after the accus@@ ation of c@@ ron@@ y@@ ism . The case will be up to the regional federation for training .
&quot; I &apos;m very feder@@ alist when considering this kind of issues , and the Andalu@@ sian organization needs to assume its responsibilities , &quot; said L@@ lam@@ az@@ ares regarding the resolution the party should adopt with the man who was an al@@ der@@ man in Si@@ vi@@ gli@@ an board until now .
Moreover , the leader stressed the need for &quot; transparency &quot; in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregul@@ arity Sil@@ va had committed , &quot; The U@@ I always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency . &quot;
Similarly , he stressed that training goes under &quot; very strict codes of ethics for all public functions . &quot;
&quot; San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o &quot; , an ep@@ ic challenge by Gar@@ ci .
J@@ ose Lu@@ is Gar@@ ci , inspired by the novel Epis@@ odi@@ os N@@ aci@@ on@@ ales of B@@ ani@@ to Pé@@ rez Gal@@ d@@ ó@@ s , recre@@ ates in San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o the span@@ ish popular ri@@ ot against the French . This is the most ambitious work of his fil@@ mo@@ graphy , with a nearly 15 million euro budget .
With this film , the director has tried to &quot; explain the tor@@ rent of characters and at the same time the social analysis &quot; that he always ad@@ mi@@ red in the work of the famous no@@ vel@@ ist , he said today , during the film &apos;s presentation , with Qu@@ im Gu@@ tier@@ rez and Pau@@ la Ech@@ ev@@ arr@@ ía heading a larger cast of interpre@@ ters .
San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o , a film longer than 2.@@ 30 hours , de@@ bu@@ ts this Friday at the cin@@ em@@ as , to become a four hours TV min@@ is@@ eries on Tel@@ e@@ Madrid in next future .
Great fan of Gal@@ d@@ ó@@ s &apos; literature , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Gar@@ ci claims this shooting realized &quot; a dream of his childhood &quot; . He likes to thank E@@ sper@@ anza A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re , who , three years earlier , had commissioned him to shoot a film to commem@@ or@@ ate the second cent@@ en@@ ary of the Madrid 2nd of May . This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid . The director agreed on condition that the story ground@@ ed on the novel Epis@@ odi@@ os N@@ aci@@ on@@ ales .
The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Gar@@ ci a &quot; unique opportunity &quot; to recre@@ ate the appropriate sets and cost@@ umes to portra@@ y a &quot; st@@ un@@ ned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the rei@@ gn of Fer@@ din@@ and VII &quot; said Gar@@ ci .
However , the director reg@@ rets not having received equal funds of Al@@ atri@@ ste or Los fantas@@ mas de Go@@ ya - more than twice compared to San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o . So far , it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan , he himself had signed together with Hor@@ acio Val@@ car@@ cel , his care@@ er-@@ long collabor@@ ator .
The difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of Vol@@ ver a em@@ pe@@ z@@ ar : for example , the st@@ aging with the actors , with whom he often uses to re@@ hear@@ se before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast , considering this &quot; hum@@ ili@@ ating &quot; and thinking that &quot; the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on . &quot;
A certain number of interpre@@ ters , some of which fall within the cast of San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o , repeat in front of his vide@@ o-@@ camera . It is the case of Michael R@@ ell , Carlos L@@ arran@@ aga or Fern@@ ando Gu@@ il@@ len Cu@@ er@@ vo .
Four times in the O@@ scar nom@@ inations - winning one - Gar@@ ci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent Spain at Hollywood this year , his San@@ gr@@ e de may@@ o , Si@@ ete mes@@ as de b@@ illar fran@@ c@@ és , and the Los selected uli@@ t@@ mo gir@@ as@@ ol@@ es ci@@ eg@@ os do represent the Spanish cinema &apos;s younger generation , &quot; that should be known instead . &quot;
Gar@@ ci does not expect awards from this film .
&quot; At first you think of working for po@@ sterity , then you realize you only work for the prosperity , and at certain point you just shoot a film more , &quot; says Gar@@ cia after more 30 years of career .
Is@@ abel Bay@@ on re@@ dis@@ covers the essence of the si@@ vi@@ gli@@ an dan@@ c@@ er Tor@@ t@@ ola Valencia
A si@@ vi@@ gli@@ an dan@@ c@@ er pays tribute to another si@@ vi@@ gli@@ an dan@@ c@@ er .
Carmen Valencia Tor@@ t@@ ola , father from Catal@@ onia ( Flor@@ en@@ ç T@@ ór@@ t@@ ola Ferr@@ er ) and mother from Andalu@@ sia ( Geor@@ g@@ ina Valencia Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela ) , was born in the district of Tri@@ ana , and moved with her family to London when three .
She was a bal@@ let dan@@ c@@ er and a free style and ori@@ ental dan@@ ces &apos; specialist .
Her life was rather fascinating and she was a pione@@ er of women &apos;s eman@@ cip@@ ation , such as Is@@ ad@@ ora Dun@@ can , Vir@@ g@@ inia Wo@@ olf or Sar@@ ah Bern@@ hardt .
She was Buddh@@ ist and veget@@ arian , and defended the cause for the cor@@ set &apos;s abolition because it prevented women from moving freely .
The life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aes@@ the@@ tics of dance in Europe between the two wars , had always fascin@@ ated Is@@ abel Bay@@ on .
&quot; I &apos;d liked to work with Pep@@ a Gam@@ boa , and she proposed me to interpret this character . It seemed to me incredible . &quot;
According to the dan@@ c@@ er &quot; we do not pre@@ tend to tell her whole life , but to collect her spirit .
Her dan@@ ces &apos; titles suggested me some elements of fl@@ amen@@ co .
Thus , &quot; la dan@@ za de la Mari@@ pos@@ a &quot; suggested me a gu@@ aj@@ ira , or the &quot; dan@@ za de la ser@@ pi@@ ente &quot; some tan@@ gos .
Her dance was sen@@ su@@ al and I was told my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic , too &quot; she says .
The st@@ aging includes two outstanding contributions : that of Miguel Po@@ v@@ eda , who will sing again Is@@ abel in one of the shows , the same he did in &quot; La pu@@ er@@ ta ab@@ ier@@ ta &quot; , and the master M@@ ati@@ l@@ de Cor@@ al , which exceptionally wanted to work together with a former student of h@@ ers .
&quot; M@@ ati@@ l@@ de interpre@@ ts Tor@@ t@@ ola in the ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood , she is the character of mat@@ urity .
I &apos;m very happy she accepted to play in my work and I feel very hon@@ oured for this . &quot;
The st@@ aging also includes the musical composition and gu@@ itar@@ ists such as Jesus Tor@@ res and P@@ aco Arri@@ aga , sing@@ ers as Miguel Ort@@ ega , Pul@@ ga y Mo@@ i of Mor@@ ón and the perc@@ ussion of El P@@ á@@ j@@ aro , the viol@@ a of Raf@@ a El Vi@@ ola and the collaboration of an actor , Ju@@ an@@ fr@@ an Ju@@ á@@ rez &quot; who plays the role of et@@ ernal comp@@ an@@ ion of artists like her , who were real round stars , and always had many lovers . &quot;
This work also tell something of this woman &apos;s life because it was mainly held in distant places , particularly for her time , such as India , United States or Russia , as well as the whole Europe , using her to res@@ ide in London .
&quot; I wanted to remember her , because I think she was one of that women who had an enormous influence in a specific historical period . Nowadays nobody rem@@ embers of her and even considers her work as something of value &quot; supports Bay@@ on .
The show will be on stage starting from today , 20.@@ 30@@ pm , at the theatre L@@ ope de V@@ ega .
The publication &quot; Di@@ ario de un po@@ eta reci@@ én cas@@ ado &quot; clos@@ es the 3 Y@@ ears An@@ ni@@ versary &apos;s celebration
The presentation of the first illustr@@ ated edition of &quot; Di@@ ario de un Po@@ eta R@@ eci@@ en@@ cas@@ ado &quot; at Saint Stephen &apos;s Church ( New York ) , the place where Juan Ram@@ ón Jim@@ é@@ nez married Z@@ en@@ o@@ bia in March 19@@ 16 , falls within the plan made by the Department of Culture of the Committee of Andalu@@ sia to celebrate the &quot; 3 Y@@ ears An@@ ni@@ versary of Z@@ en@@ o@@ bia and Juan Ram@@ on &quot; ( 200@@ 6-@@ 2008 ) , organized to commem@@ or@@ ate the fif@@ tieth anniversary of the allocation of the Nobel Prize in Liter@@ ature and the death of both .
So far , the &quot; 3 Y@@ ears An@@ ni@@ versary of Z@@ en@@ o@@ bia and Juan Ram@@ on &quot; ends with the second edition of this work , with the International Congress held in New York , the restoration of the hou@@ se-@@ museum of the Nobel pri@@ zed and the travelling exhibition &quot; Juan Ram@@ ón Jim@@ é@@ nez : Aqu@@ el ch@@ op de lu@@ z &quot; , which was inau@@ gur@@ ated last May and , after having touched the various provin@@ ces of Andalu@@ sia , is expected to be brought to New York in conjunction with the International Congress .
In addition , the Department of Culture of the Committee of Andalu@@ sia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the &quot; Di@@ ario de un Po@@ eta R@@ eci@@ en@@ cas@@ ado &quot; , edited by Peter Tab@@ ern@@ ero and illustr@@ ated by James Per@@ e@@ z-@@ En@@ c@@ is@@ o , to promote and spread the figure and the works of one of the highest Andalu@@ sian po@@ ets .
We like America a bit less without Paul New@@ man
&quot; Sometimes God creates perfect people .
Paul New@@ man was one of those . &quot;
The sentence is by S@@ ally F@@ ield , who worked with him in &quot; Aus@@ encia de mal@@ ici@@ a &quot; and gives the feeling of American cinema &apos;s im@@ poten@@ ce , and throughout America , facing the shock that New@@ man has gone .
And awar@@ ding him with an O@@ scar had been quite hard .
And in 2007 he had reti@@ red .
And people also knew he was very ill .
Although this , it was a very hard blow for all .
&quot; Sometimes your feelings go far beyond any word , and now I lost a great friend , &quot; cri@@ ed Robert Red@@ ford , &quot; my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence . &quot;
No one was afraid of result ridicul@@ ous or exagger@@ ate .
A father of the cinema and of the country had died in a particularly dark period , with the fear of terrorists and markets , with American people &apos;s self-@@ est@@ e@@ em on the ground , desper@@ ately seeking new reasons to feel worthy .
When times are so difficult , men so less virtu@@ ous and with very few beings ad@@ mi@@ red by people , you have not to be Lu@@ is C@@ ern@@ u@@ da to love Paul New@@ man .
For all people he em@@ bo@@ died the Plat@@ onic ideal of beauty and truth .
He was an official enemy of Richard Ni@@ x@@ on and a suppor@@ ter of lost and won causes , starting from the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the fir@@ st@@ born who died of over@@ do@@ ses until the promotion of a new brand for hom@@ e-@@ made and organic food .
All gifts he did to a country which had to pay huge costs to go beyond a suici@@ dal food culture .
The wave of admir@@ ation went beyond Hollywood , independently from nationality or passport .
The latest James B@@ ond , the English actor Daniel Cra@@ ig , observed that this is not a dead man , it is an era which is over .
Another English man , S@@ am Men@@ des , a director who won the O@@ scar , said that working with New@@ man was nothing less than the highest peak of his career .
The bad boy arrived from Australia , Rus@@ sell Cro@@ we , arrived to define Paul New@@ man as his biggest inspiration .
&quot; He left an example of the highest level for all of us , &quot; notes George C@@ lo@@ on@@ ey , perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul New@@ man did : maintaining in high consideration the need for rec@@ titude and having a serious private life , away from the cameras .
This is not always easy or possible in contemporary media jung@@ le .
However , some people will try and Paul New@@ man will remain a very good example to get them inspired .
After the di@@ vor@@ ce , his second marriage with Jo@@ anne Woo@@ d@@ ward la@@ sted fif@@ ty years long , and he remained fai@@ thful having certainly opportunities for not being so .
&quot; Why am I going out to have my ham@@ bur@@ gers , when I can have a good ste@@ ak at home ? &quot; used to jo@@ ke himself .
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his dau@@ gh@@ ters who are also his fans on the earth , something not so common in America .
&quot; Of all the major roles he interpreted , none he was so proud of than that of devoted husband , lo@@ ving father , attentive grand@@ father and passion@@ ate phi@@ lan@@ throp@@ ist &quot; they say .
The im@@ perfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes , the dream of many of us is that one day Olymp@@ ics will be held in Madrid and , after the failed attempt in 2012 , this could happen in 20@@ 16 .
But I wonder , are we ready ?
If we follow the example of yesterday race , I just say no !
They called it the &quot; perfect race &quot; but in my opinion it was by far the worst I witnessed .
All a non@@ sense , that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it , the output would be totally negative .
But let &apos;s go with order and start from the very beginning .
The non@@ sense began with the collection of the back number , which pres@@ up@@ posed you went there before the race .
It did not seem a bad idea , but if you &apos;re forced to go , it should be to withdraw all things ( including the chip to avoid qu@@ eu@@ es during the race ) .
But this was not .
We went there just to collect the back number ( first non@@ sense , just go for this only reason ) and ( after the qu@@ eu@@ e ) , surprise ! they only had &quot; S &quot; size T-@@ shi@@ rts ( second non@@ sense , because I need an X@@ L ) .
What kind of world are we living in ?
Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T-@@ shi@@ rts , made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive ?
Well , these things were nothing if compared with the day of the race .
We had to go very early to collect the chip but the qu@@ eu@@ e was 15 minutes long and , furthermore , you had to deposit your back@@ pack .
The wait la@@ sted more than 35 minutes , something in@@ comprehensible for a race where you expect more than 11@@ ,000 people .
Then , as expected , the race started when we had not even handed over the back@@ pack , although , once succeeded , the recovery was even worse .
In addition , the rain threatened the waiting longer than 40 minutes , which went along with a kind of popular re@@ bel@@ lion and an attempted ass@@ ault to stand .
I believe we will be around 500 people surely with p@@ neum@@ onia tomorrow , and some , like me , not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chip , which , I sup@@ pose , did not record the arrival time properly .
In future , if I will be asked for the perfect race , this one w@@ ont &apos;t certainly enter in my thoughts .
At the end of the day , I think we will continue to dream of an Olympic and well prepared city .
Microsoft looks for a ( virtual ) recep@@ tion@@ ist
During the conference on Emer@@ ging Technologies at the M@@ IT , Microsoft presented a preview of the new recognition and human interaction system , a kind of artificial intelligence , but without that much intelligence , able to perform some basic tasks , such as call a taxi ( or , in the scenario described by Microsoft , a shuttle service to move within the company &apos;s camp@@ us ) &quot; understanding &quot; what happens in a standard conversation .
Thanks to a camera and a forms and faces &apos; recognition system , this &quot; recep@@ tion@@ ist &quot; may know how many people are there in a specific room , who are they – including remember what &apos;s their position - and listen and understand the key@@ words in a conversation with them .
It may also clu@@ stered people in groups of conversation .
The demo showed that the recep@@ tion@@ ist notes a third person , understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company &apos;s employee .
It asks him if he &apos;s there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible .
This without any aw@@ ful blue screen .
A@@ wes@@ ome .
But this is the future , of course .
Now the company needs to focus on many other issues , such as the next Windows operating system &apos;s release .
This week it was a big talk on Microsoft &apos;s change of strategy .
Windows 7 will be ligh@@ ter and will not be charged with so many programs .
Steve Ball@@ mer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rub@@ b@@ ish , these should be five times faster - h@@ ey ! Steve , will be for less .
A real discovery , if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft , version after version has only added features and &quot; ex@@ tras &quot; to Windows .
The change of direction is very welcome .
Microsoft is right : the operating system will be increasingly losing importance , and the software with it .
When Google launched Ch@@ rome , I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with Windows .
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system .
The operating system will be always a necessity because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate .
It perform@@ s the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mo@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law .
It &apos;s true .
It won &apos;t ever disappear , perhaps you just need to think about the &quot; death &quot; of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one .
What Ball@@ mer said this week confirms this idea .
People give less attention to the operating system , and increasingly focus on the browser .
They only use the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Ch@@ rome - daily and spend a longer time brow@@ sing the web rather than working in a window environment .
What half of the operating system &apos;s applications are there for ?
L@@ ess is more .
And Windows 7 should be less , much less than Vista .
L@@ ess heavy , less loaded , less complex .
A Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should constitute a viable alternative to Google .
Ac@@ tually , they desper@@ ately need it . Let &apos;s take a little example .
I shot the photo of this post during the Microsoft employees &apos; break , in Red@@ mond , earlier this month .
A sign , hang@@ ing on the soft drinks &apos; machine suggested them to use the company &apos;s search engine - &quot; Your search . Our Future &quot; .
In 2006 , an independent study reached the conclusion that the 66 % of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the net .
Last week , moreover , Microsoft confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 .
It will not be launched on the market at the beginning of 2009 , but even at the end , maybe in 2010 .
Microsoft surely will try a joint launch , Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together .
Our phones , at the very end , is increasingly becoming a computer .
But the delay , with Andro@@ id and the iPhone already on marketing , will result detri@@ mental .
The Fab@@ u@@ leu@@ x Mar@@ cel
P@@ ab@@ lo Pic@@ asso used to dress it while in the French Riviera , Leonardo di Cap@@ ri@@ o sh@@ one with one of this in &apos; Diam@@ ante de san@@ gr@@ e &apos; by Ed@@ ward Z@@ wick , as well as Al P@@ ac@@ ino in &apos; The Go@@ d@@ father &apos; of Franc@@ is Ford C@@ opp@@ ola . Moreover , it is part of the typical uniform worn by the mus@@ cular g@@ ay parish .
If we try to count the number of stars wearing it , we can also recall the image of the strong@@ -@@ built man with pointed mu@@ sta@@ che who li@@ fted wei@@ ghts in the st@@ rolling cir@@ cus .
Finally , this is nothing more than the typical T-@@ shirt for men , with a cotton interior , tight and sle@@ ev@@ eless shape .
It is the &apos; tank &apos; , as English speakers call it , though , the Brussels Fab@@ u@@ leu@@ x Mar@@ cel stands out above all .
First of all , this is due to its gr@@ andi@@ ose name - even if it is commonly known just as &quot; Mar@@ cel &quot; - name that has something to do with the sport because it deri@@ ves , according to the legend , from the box@@ er Mar@@ cel Cer@@ dan , who loved the singer Edi@@ th Pi@@ af .
The &quot; Mar@@ cel &quot; exc@@ els - if compared to the others - for its high quality cotton , for its un@@ is@@ ex cutting , for his distinctive little shi@@ eld and the small Belgian flag ( barely recogni@@ z@@ able ) , which the most emb@@ lem@@ atic models keep as a detail on the neck .
And open your eyes ! , because the Belgian company does not produce only its famous &quot; tank &quot; .
The production also includes college swe@@ ats , vin@@ tage box@@ ers , c@@ ash@@ mere car@@ di@@ gan@@ s , cotton tro@@ users , sail@@ or shi@@ rts , bab@@ y-@@ d@@ olls , mini shor@@ ts ...
Gar@@ ments meant to be comfortable .
It is a pity to use them as under@@ wear .
They &apos;re too smart .
&quot; I want to be a young mother , doesn &apos;t matter the candidate &quot;
The great res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance with her sister has not prevented her from developing a strong personality .
Mon@@ ica Cruz is a tiny woman , but still , full of vit@@ ality .
Currently , both the Cruz si@@ sters have taken very seriously their new activity in the fashion field .
According to Mon@@ ica , it is much more than beautiful girls and celeb@@ ri@@ ties who lend their names .
She went to Paris for the campaign Mang@@ o is hang@@ ing on to promote the new branch , and the presentation of the most important prizes for fashion sponsor@@ ed by the Spanish fashion house .
War@@ m and tim@@ id , she con@@ qu@@ ers you quite quickly .
T@@ ell us what you &apos;re doing in Paris .
I came here to present the new collection my sister Pen@@ el@@ ope and I have designed for the new Mang@@ o aut@@ um@@ n-@@ winter season , to join the second edition of &apos; Mang@@ o Fas@@ hion Awards &apos; and the Opera dinner in honour of Val@@ entino .
Let &apos;s say , a very intense day but a very exciting one , at the same time .
What is the inspiration of your new collection for Mang@@ o in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house ?
Both my sister that I like the cinema of the 50@@ s and 6@@ 0s . From there we get bigger inspir@@ ations .
Then , I like to get lost in the city and look at how women dress , at the way they combine and mix their clothes . I do it quite frequently .
D@@ anc@@ er , act@@ ress and designer , you &apos;re a very versatile woman , aren &apos;t you ?
I think so , although at the very end , all mer@@ ged and many elements remain cross-@@ field ideas .
I liked clothes since I was a child . I loved to visit my grand@@ mother to rum@@ ma@@ ge in my a@@ unt &apos;s c@@ up@@ boards and discover her clothes .
It was so good ! , much better than going to the am@@ us@@ ement park .
Then , once a dan@@ c@@ er , I always took great care of my dres@@ sing .
It is known dan@@ c@@ ers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance rec@@ it@@ als , to look themselves in the mirror and feel good .
And in the act@@ ress role , when you are delivered the war@@ dro@@ be , this is the time you actually encounter the character .
So , everything goes together , yes , with a lot of respect for designers and professionals .
Not long ago , you celebrated your 30 years , did you entered a crisis ?
Absol@@ utely I didn &apos;t .
I &apos;ve never felt better , I like to be 30 years old .
I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors .
I &apos;m not scar@@ ed by the biological clock .
Since I was a child , I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness .
So , are you thinking of being mother or not ?
Yes , of course , I &apos;m . I know it is my same body pushing me for this and also I want to be a young mo@@ m , I &apos;m not g@@ onna miss it .
And about the candidate … Does not matter that much .
I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educ@@ ate him with bigger love .
Tal@@ king about cinema , you are waiting the release of some films you acted last year .
That is , and I &apos;m really cur@@ ious about that .
Com@@ ing from the theat@@ ri@@ cal experience , I am a very imp@@ ati@@ ent and anx@@ ious woman , I want everything now and clearly , but I know this may not be always possible .
I &apos;m looking forward mainly for &quot; La ú@@ l@@ tima hor@@ a &quot; and &quot; En bus@@ ca de la tum@@ ba de Crist@@ o &quot; .
Let &apos;s see if you like it ...
Fe@@ w days ago you deb@@ uted on the cat@@ walk side by side with Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bel@@ l , didn &apos;t you ?
Well , don &apos;t put it this way .
It &apos;s not I was on the cat@@ walk as a professional model .
Simply Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bel@@ l , whom I know since a long time , called and invited me to go to London and attend a char@@ ity fashion show for her organization &quot; Women for a Better World &quot; . The clothes presented during the show - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mang@@ o - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this Na@@ om@@ i &apos;s NG@@ O .
People usually ignore this Na@@ om@@ i &apos;s tender heart .
It is said so many things on her , that , knowing her quite well , I can assure you are not true .
Moreover , I like to share and get involved in this good part of h@@ ers .
She asked me to be shown for a noble cause , but if I had asked to play a pine , I would do it anyway .
You cannot back out of helping the third world women .
Dri@@ vers re@@ tic@@ ent of alco@@ holi@@ sm should install the &apos; al@@ col@@ o@@ ck@@ &apos;
The Inter@@ ior Office wants the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoho@@ lic rate , to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when dr@@ unk . The same if you do not blow into the measuring device .
The measure was announced last June and has been already included in the Annual Report of the State Att@@ or@@ ney General , according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year .
This project &apos;s goal is the rein@@ statement of the driver , since he will need to attend a course of road re-@@ education .
The initiative is supported by the Att@@ or@@ ney General for Road Safety , together with the General Direc@@ torate of Traff@@ ic ( D@@ G@@ T ) and the Techn@@ ological Institute Foundation for Security in the Autom@@ obile ( F@@ IT@@ S ) .
According to statistics , between 30 % and 75 % of drivers fined more than once for dr@@ unk driving , still drive a car .
The &apos; al@@ col@@ ock &apos; would avoid this , because the device , connected to the vehicle , measures the rate of alcohol in bre@@ ath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it , or in case it det@@ ects in the car an higher alcoho@@ lic concentration than permitted by law .
The cost of the device , a bit more than 1000 euro , should be charged to the sanc@@ tioned .
In this regard , a study conducted in 2007 in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infrin@@ gements up to 65 % during the first year of introduction .
And in Spain it was estimated it could save around 115 lives in one year .
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons : first of all to stop these behavi@@ ors before they turn into criminal off@@ enses .
And second , to facilitate the implementation of this practice , as the legal reform can be ordin@@ arily made , but , on the contrary , the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law .
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution , even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transpor@@ ts .
Just tomorrow , the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties will vote a PS@@ O@@ E &apos;s initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in school buses , as has already been done in France .
In Mexico , and without her pe@@ ep@@ -@@ to@@ es &quot;
In line with the British punc@@ tu@@ ality , at 17.@@ 40 pm , perfectly on schedule , the Spanish airline land@@ ed at the presidential hang@@ ar of Ben@@ ito Ju@@ á@@ rez airport in Mexico City , bringing there the Prices of Ast@@ uri@@ as .
The suns@@ et was almost done but the sun &apos;s rays still forced you to use your hand as a vis@@ or to see the royal couple getting off the plane .
The Spanish amb@@ ass@@ ador and other authorities stood at the foot of the lad@@ der .
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver , along the street , if he knew that the Spanish prin@@ ces were about visiting the city to form@@ alize an official travel .
- A@@ h , very good , so we cannot go to the airport and collect people in that time band ... Is she from here or ...
- No , no si@@ r , she is Spanish , but lived in your country for a couple of years .
- A@@ h , well ...
On the way round , the Mexican press perfectly knows who are the prin@@ ces of Ast@@ uri@@ as and is aware of the importance of the travel .
Many are those who wait for them at the airport &apos;s hang@@ ar , crow@@ ded together on the red car@@ pet and closed to a military line composed by 27 nav@@ y soldiers offering the honour gre@@ eting .
The prin@@ ce appears sm@@ iling , with a nav@@ y blue dress , and she , the pr@@ inc@@ ess , hair in the wind , very so@@ ber , does not wear her &quot; pe@@ ep@@ -@@ to@@ es &quot; as usual . Perhaps she had been reported Mexico City is threatened by bad weather .
They give photograph@@ ers a s@@ mile and a brief stop@@ over before moving to the room where the official group is looking forward to them .
By the door of the hotel where they &apos;re going to stay , one of the biggest four in the city , a f@@ unny re@@ porter of Mexican television wa@@ its for them .
The best fashion award
Prob@@ ably there is not a more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award , and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as Val@@ entino .
Mang@@ o has just presented the second edition of El Bot@@ ó@@ n-@@ Mang@@ o Fas@@ hion Awards , to support the international promotion of new tal@@ ents in the fashion field .
It offers a prize of 300@@ ,000 euros .
Yesterday , Sand@@ rin@@ a Fas@@ oli , the Belgian winner of the first edition , looked at his drawings in the Mang@@ o &apos;s window at the number 54 of Bou@@ levard Haus@@ sm@@ ann – Paris , and was almost cr@@ ying for emo@@ tion .
Moreover , the company &apos;s store is the second largest in Europe , recently opened on 13@@ 35 square meters &apos; space .
The most important one is located in London .
The numerous events , combined with the desire to please the designer Val@@ entino who ch@@ ai@@ red the jury of the contest , brought us to a luxury dinner at the Gar@@ nier Opera in Paris .
The proximity of the most exquisite paintings by Cha@@ gal made the presidential g@@ ala table prepared by Mang@@ o even more spectacular .
N@@ ati , with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity , because of the recent death of her brother , wor@@ e a dress of the company and fashion compl@@ ements by E@@ LA@@ H that took your bre@@ ath away . So , arm in arm with her son Lu@@ is - a two meters height boy - accompanied Val@@ entino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized .
An@@ di@@ k , owner and master of Mang@@ o , welcomed the guests and as the gentlem@@ an he is , along with Bar@@ on Rot@@ ch@@ il arrived at the end of the night without his jack@@ et , because both had granted it to two ladies .
Mon@@ ica Cruz , who ran the shop in tro@@ users and shirt - designed by herself – changed her dress for the dinner , wearing a very sen@@ su@@ al long black dress . She got very exc@@ ited when , during the night walk inside the opera house , accompanied by Go@@ ya Tol@@ edo , we were shown the room for dance rec@@ it@@ als , and rec@@ alling other times , she grab@@ bed a bar and outlined a &quot; grand p@@ lie &quot; .
In@@ és Sa@@ str@@ e did not join the walk inside the building , but before leaving , showed us her son &apos;s photos on her mobile phone .
Next morning we welcomed the presence of Oli@@ vier Mart@@ ine@@ z - another boy who likes moving by motor@@ bike - and John Tra@@ vol@@ ta , who arrived at the Inter@@ continental Hotel of Paris , bringing his own sheets , towels and only after asking to have no sm@@ ells in his room .
Stars under the star@@ lit Paris sky .

10@@ 01 , the number anti-@@ stress
It is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 the way to forget the cha@@ otic and hec@@ tic everyday life .
And if it seems not enough , all these ways have been collected in a book which will bring the relax to the book@@ stores by the 30@@ th of September .
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when ring@@ ing every morning at 7 o &apos;@@ clock , but the worst is ima@@ ging yourself involved in the fran@@ tic pace dict@@ ated by modern life .
Office means tension , computer back pain .
Stress is the illness of the twenty-@@ first century .
However , you are offered now neither one nor two ways to combat daily exhaus@@ tion and the struggle in taking a proper distance from the work &apos;s dimension ,
but no more no less than 10@@ 01 ways .
Beyond y@@ oga positions , the classic massage or the &quot; spa &quot; treatments , Sus@@ ann@@ ah Mar@@ ri@@ ott coll@@ ects in the pages of her book , a &quot; menu &quot; full of options tailored to individual tastes and needs .
The anti-@@ stress work is ti@@ tled &quot; 10@@ 01 ways to relax &quot; and will be available in the libraries thanks to Pear@@ son Al@@ ham@@ bra and D@@ K publish@@ ers .
If someone believes winning the peace in areas such as business or personal relationships is not possible , this &quot; manual &quot; den@@ ies that belief .
It also suggests alternatives , such as staying in touch with nature , or provides 100 % natural recip@@ es that help to relax .
If the ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine is not already f@@ lowing in your v@@ eins to produce the balance of the body and stress has become a major problem for you , it &apos;s time to sit on the cou@@ ch , turn off your mind and focus on reading .
Spe@@ aking while sleeping
Some children speak during the night .
I am not referring to those who wake up very ag@@ it@@ ated to tell us something happened to them the day before , but those children who talk while as@@ le@@ ep .
The first time it happens , at most , you get scar@@ ed , but it really does not have that much importance .
This is a ben@@ ign alter@@ ation of sleep , defined som@@ ni@@ lo@@ qu@@ y .
It is a quite common phenomenon , especially in children and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents .
Certainly , most of you have been told talked in your sleep .
This phenomenon can occur very spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally ( just once in life , for example , associated with an episode of high f@@ ever ) or on a more regular basis ( every day , once a week , once in the month ... ) . The day after the child does not remember anything .
There is not a single reason to explain the presence of som@@ ni@@ lo@@ qu@@ y .
Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep dis@@ orders such as night@@ mar@@ es , night fears , no@@ c@@ turn@@ al en@@ ur@@ esis ( do pe@@ e in bed ) , or sle@@ ep@@ walking , but it is not necessarily the case .
As mentioned above , it may be associated with stages of very high f@@ ever , in situations of stress or over exc@@ itement .
In any case , this phenomenon is not resear@@ ched that well .
Even its intensity is extremely variable .
It may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice , with loose words , almost in a wh@@ is@@ per , or the opposite ( scre@@ ams , cri@@ es , long speeches ... ) .
In case the event is particularly intense , the child should be observed and possibly , a specialist should be consulted to check if the ab@@ normal state of anx@@ i@@ ety is due to any question , thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings .
We said that this is a ben@@ ign alter@@ ation , therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep dis@@ orders which , instead , can be treated ( for example , if coupled with ins@@ om@@ nia or a situation of stress ) .
What you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very simple preventive measures , such as :
Try not to over-@@ exc@@ ite the child before going to sleep .
Pro@@ pose calm games and avoid television programs or series that insp@@ ire fear or suggest violence .
Very ner@@ vous children for whom relaxing is a very hard task , need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm .
This will allow the child to sleep more peac@@ efully .
Once som@@ ni@@ lo@@ qu@@ y appears , try to keep calm .
Remember that it is an in@@ offensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it .
U@@ se@@ ful Ti@@ ps
Don &apos;t wake him up .
It is us@@ eless , because he is not aware of what is going on , and you just inter@@ rupt his sleeping .
Although he is talking , he is as@@ le@@ ep and thus , he is res@@ ting .
Remember that if he appears very an@@ gu@@ ished and the epis@@ odes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such a great anx@@ i@@ ety comes from .
If you get what he is saying ( which is not the most common situation ) does not fall into temp@@ tation to make him an inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation to obtain information .
Do not get anything , because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts .
In addition , you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dre@@ aming about to say that things . Therefore , be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead .
Do not ever tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his sec@@ rets .
Not even j@@ ok@@ ingly .
This can generate a huge anx@@ i@@ ety .
In short , do not worry , it &apos;s nothing serious , just an episode that la@@ sts few minutes .
I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ us@@ ern ... finally
I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ us@@ ern has finally reg@@ ained its path to victory on its own soil after a long period of drau@@ ght .
Without playing a great match , the Y@@ ellow and Black have created the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner .
The rhyth@@ m was not very steady during the match and the attack@@ ers found it hard to express themselves .
After a first attempt by the guest cap@@ tain K@@ auff@@ mann who nar@@ row@@ ly missed the goal from a far shot , I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ us@@ ern went on to take a slight lead and in turn F@@ onder@@ f@@ lick from af@@ ar , then with Hir@@ n from high , Rom@@ ain with the tip of his foot or again Di@@ eb@@ old came to tick@@ le the D@@ ann@@ em@@ ar@@ ie defence .
At the front , there was a mid@@ field block that allowed just the centre forward Ri@@ a@@ hi at the for@@ efront of the attack .
The beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Ri@@ a@@ hi and Tem@@ por@@ ale for D@@ ann@@ em@@ ar@@ ie , immediately after the score was opened for I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ usern@@ s by Mar@@ ais , well positioned to pick up a ball bo@@ un@@ ced off an initial attempt by Di@@ eb@@ old ( 53 &apos; ) .
But the I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ us@@ ern stri@@ ker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the lo@@ cker room a do@@ zen minutes later , leaving his te@@ am-@@ m@@ ates numer@@ ically inf@@ erior .
But D@@ ann@@ em@@ ar@@ ie could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the I@@ ll@@ ha@@ e@@ us@@ ern Ele@@ ven who just fell back a little to make its defence more &quot; compact &quot; , except in the very last few seconds of the game where , after a big m@@ ess , the ball went very near the cro@@ s@@ spi@@ ece .
Sarkozy meets an@@ gr@@ y fishermen .
Before leaving for the United States , Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a trip to Britt@@ any .
Fac@@ ing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly distur@@ bed the access to several ports in Britt@@ any and Nor@@ mand@@ y , on Tuesday morning at Gu@@ il@@ vin@@ ec port , in Fin@@ ist@@ ère , the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives .
The latter have promised to accept &quot; with a constructive spirit &quot; and they hope he &quot; will arrive with practical proposals &quot; .
A presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the &quot; crisis committee &quot; created by fishermen in Britt@@ any to come up with measures of addressing the so@@ aring prices of oil , which pe@@ aked at an average of more than 1.@@ 14 Euro per li@@ tre .
According to the Elys@@ ée spo@@ kes@@ man David Mar@@ tin@@ on , the president &quot; will discuss with them solutions that can be de@@ vised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sail@@ ors &apos; remuner@@ ation &quot;
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen .
On Tuesday morning , they conducted slow driving operations in the Mor@@ bi@@ han and Cal@@ v@@ ados , causing traffic j@@ ams for almost 10 km .
The leisure craft harbour of Qu@@ i@@ ber@@ on was also blocked , but the roads to Bel@@ le-@@ Is@@ le were not blocked .
A fil@@ tering road@@ block was set up on the Qu@@ i@@ ber@@ on peninsula .
The sail@@ ors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning , since da@@ wn , ti@@ res and p@@ all@@ ets in front of the fuel de@@ pots at the port of B@@ rest and L@@ ori@@ ent , while demonstrations were taking place in Con@@ car@@ ne@@ au or Saint-@@ Bri@@ eu@@ c .
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel , such as S@@ ables d &apos;@@ O@@ lon@@ ne in V@@ end@@ ée , where tra@@ w@@ lers remained do@@ cked at the qu@@ ay@@ side or Le Hav@@ re , where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any mer@@ ch@@ ant ships .
Fis@@ her@@ men in La Tur@@ b@@ alle and Cro@@ is@@ ic , in Lo@@ i@@ re-@@ Atlan@@ tique , in the evening stopped the block@@ ade of the important Total re@@ fin@@ ery at Don@@ ges .
Those at Bou@@ log@@ ne-@@ sur@@ -@@ M@@ er have decided to wait until after the meeting at the mini@@ stry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions .
In Gu@@ il@@ vin@@ ec , the &quot; crisis committee &quot; has to decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris .
But some Bre@@ ton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries , which did not support their movement .
&quot; The strike will continue &quot; because &quot; the fishermen will not give up &quot; and &quot; do not want to have to move onto Paris &quot; , for example , announced L@@ ili@@ ane C@@ ari@@ ou , president of the Fisheries Committee of L@@ ori@@ ent .
Professional fishermen , who pay no taxes on diesel , currently pay about 50 c@@ ents per li@@ tre but believe that the threshold of profit@@ ability for a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel prices less than 0.@@ 30 Euro per li@@ tre .

A@@ I@@ G would ce@@ de more than 15 % of its assets
The International American In@@ surance Group , that the U.S. monetary authorities have re@@ flo@@ ated , plans to sell more than 15 % of its assets to rep@@ ay the $ 85 billion that were advanced to it , according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times .
A@@ I@@ G is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its pension business in the United States , said the newspaper quot@@ ing sources close to the case .
The administration board of A@@ I@@ G met on Sunday evening to consider possible c@@ ess@@ ations , according to the FT .
No confirmation could be obtained from A@@ I@@ G .
The assets which A@@ I@@ G plans to ce@@ de include its le@@ asing subsidiary Air International Le@@ ase Financial Cor@@ p@@ . , its participation of 59 % in the re@@ ins@@ ured Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Hol@@ dings , and its property portfolio in addition to its private equity investments , the FT added .
No final decision has been taken on these dispos@@ als , the FT continued .
A@@ I@@ G must quickly find the funds to rep@@ ay the loan of 85 billion that it has with the Federal Reserve or else risk seeing the U.S. authorities take 80 % of its shares , dil@@ uting the proportion due to current shareholders .

In terms of points , the biggest drop in its history ( 68@@ 4.@@ 81 points ) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001 , the day of the resum@@ ption of trade after the terrorist attacks of S@@ ept . 11 .
The Nas@@ da@@ q index , mainly technological , has lost 199@@ .@@ 61 points to 198@@ 3.@@ 73 and the expanded Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s 500 index 8.@@ 81 % ( or 10@@ 6.@@ 85 points ) to 1@@ 10@@ 6.@@ 55 points , according to final closing figures .
Already suffering a depression at the beginning of the meeting , Wall Street went down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives of the rescue plan for banks that was to in@@ ject some stability in the markets .
With 2@@ 28 votes against and 20@@ 5 for , the deleg@@ ates have refused to Treas@@ ury Secretary Henry Pau@@ l@@ son the resources he asked for .
N@@ early two out of three Republic@@ ans rejected his plan .
&quot; This is a bad signal for the market , which saw the Congress failing to adopt a plan , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey Pi@@ eg@@ ż@@ a of FT@@ N Financial .
&quot; This shows how much the market reli@@ ed on this plan , &quot; she added , fear@@ ing that a draft adopted in several days time can be &quot; too late &quot; .
&quot; If the project is effectively dead ( ... ) then the rel@@ ay will be quickly passed to the Fed ( i.e. the U.S. central bank ) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tigh@@ ten the credit conditions &quot; , predic@@ ted Bri@@ an Be@@ th@@ une , chief econom@@ ist at Global In@@ sight .
And further acc@@ entu@@ ating the sense of urgency , &quot; each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution &quot; in the United States , emphasised Mrs Pi@@ eg@@ ż@@ a .
After the bank@@ rupt@@ cy of Washington Mut@@ ual on Friday , the authorities have organized the tak@@ eover of Wach@@ o@@ via &apos;s banking activities by its ri@@ val Ci@@ tig@@ ro@@ up .
In Europe , the crisis has acceler@@ ated sharp@@ ly , pushing for emergency interventions by banks in the United Kingdom , Ben@@ el@@ ux , Iceland and Germany , a sign that the markets face &quot; not only a crisis in U.S. , but a global crisis &quot; , added the analy@@ st from FT@@ N Financial .
The bond market has clim@@ bed sharp@@ ly .
The performance of 10-@@ year Treas@@ ury bond fell to 3.@@ 6@@ 32 % , against 3.@@ 8@@ 27 % on Friday evening , and the 30-@@ year bond to 4.@@ 16@@ 1 % , against 4.@@ 3@@ 57 % on the previous day .
Obama , who won on points the first tel@@ ev@@ ised du@@ el
To the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who , John Mc@@ C@@ ain or Barack Obama , won .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the campaign headquarters of the Republic@@ ans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the tel@@ ev@@ ised du@@ el which was wat@@ ched by a third of American families .
The political analy@@ st David Ger@@ gen believes that John Mc@@ C@@ ain &apos;s performance , though admir@@ able , was not &quot; brilliant &quot; enough to enable it to reverse its decline in the poll@@ s five weeks from the presidential election .
The Gall@@ up , whose opinion pol@@ l published on Saturday gives a five points lead to Obama ( 49 % against 44 % for Mc@@ C@@ ain ) , judges that the Democrats have pul@@ led their own on Thursday .
According to a C@@ BS pol@@ l , among the un@@ decided voters , who are those that count , Obama has won 39 % of respon@@ dents , while 25 % of them give victory to Mc@@ C@@ ain .
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate , Joseph Bi@@ den , during the first and only public debate with his ri@@ val , Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in .
&quot; It would be a mistake to under@@ estimate her .
She has good inst@@ inc@@ ts nonetheless &quot; , warned Bill Clinton this weekend .
The se@@ p@@ tu@@ agen@@ arian Mc@@ C@@ ain has repeatedly put forward his un@@ question@@ able experience in foreign policy , while stres@@ sing the &quot; na@@ i@@ v@@ ety &quot; of his oppon@@ ent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face debate .
&quot; Sen@@ ator Obama does not seem to understand that ... &quot; he accused several times .
&quot; I do not believe that Sen@@ ator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president , &quot; he also assured .
An angle of attack h@@ amm@@ ered yesterday in Republic@@ an television adverti@@ sements .
Obama , himself , has stressed that he represented the future .
Without dis@@ ass@@ em@@ bling , he was conc@@ ise and precise .
He put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world .
&quot; Mc@@ C@@ ain has never understood , while Obama , if &quot; , argued this weekend , a Democratic spot critici@@ zing the Republic@@ an of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the &quot; American on the streets &quot; .
&quot; During the nin@@ et@@ y-@@ ten minute debate , John Mc@@ C@@ ain had much to say about me , but nothing about you , Obama den@@ ounced yesterday to 20 000 people assemb@@ led for an electoral meeting in North Carol@@ ina in the po@@ uring rain .
He did not even utter the words &quot; middle class &quot; or &quot; workers &quot; . &quot; The financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to Obama , who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the br@@ ink of a pre@@ cip@@ ice .
&quot; The coming week could be a turning point &quot; , estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Sen@@ ator Charles Sch@@ um@@ er .
The Democratic representative Rah@@ m E@@ manu@@ el , an al@@ um@@ n@@ us of the Clinton administration , compared the &quot; good economic inst@@ inc@@ ts &quot; of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis .
For the Democratic candidate , the current crisis &quot; is the final ver@@ dict of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Sen@@ ator Mc@@ C@@ ain &quot; .
Re@@ affir@@ ming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95 % of the Americans despite the tur@@ mo@@ il on Wall Street , the sen@@ ator from Il@@ lin@@ ois also reported that the achievement of the country &apos;s energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority , together with the establishment of a system of health insurance .
Mc@@ C@@ ain , he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 20@@ 30 .
Cau@@ tious , both candidates have do@@ dged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars ( 4@@ 70 billion Euro ) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely un@@ popular .
In M@@ ins@@ k , &quot; have you noticed that there was an election , have you ? &quot;
Young people and other opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belar@@ u@@ sian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation .
A few hundred Belar@@ usi@@ ans gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of poll@@ ing stations in the central square of M@@ ins@@ k to protest against the frau@@ dul@@ ent elections .
While no results have as yet been announced , many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko : &quot; the dict@@ ator , resign@@ ation . &quot;
Some conf@@ ess to not having even voted : &quot; What for , since they will do whatever they want of my voice , &quot; said a youth .
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn .
The sanctions , which include visa b@@ ans for 40 Belar@@ u@@ sian officials and the free@@ zing of assets , could be li@@ fted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers .
They have not been according to the opposition .
&quot; We were kept away from the electoral commission@@ s and our observers were unable to participate in the count , &quot; lament@@ ed Y@@ ur@@ i Pot@@ em@@ kin , the spo@@ kes@@ person for the Union of Democratic For@@ ces , a hetero@@ gene@@ ous group@@ ing of twelve parties .
&quot; It &apos;s a cosmetic change , empha@@ sizes Alexander Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch , a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro@@ -European movement , because it &apos;s who counts the votes that is important , and here , that is the executive power .
If opposition members enter parliament , it is because they have been appointed , not elected .
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television , meetings in the regions , and proposed laws . &quot;
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because &quot; we must open a dialogue with the European Union .
Because if our economy which is heavily in debt with Russia , enters into a crisis , and if we do not reform ourselves , we risk becoming a prot@@ ec@@ torate of Russia .
We want to be independent &quot; .
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which monitored the electoral process , does not recognize the validity of the bal@@ lot .
She stressed that the participation figures seem too high , and that the spread in vot@@ er turn@@ out ( 26 % of voters in M@@ ins@@ k ) has opened the vote to all sorts of manipul@@ ations .
&quot; Have you noticed that there was an election , have you ? Qu@@ eries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Ko@@ zu@@ lin , one of two political prisoners released in August this year .
There was nobody at the voting offices .
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament , those who are most convenient to those in power . &quot;
The silence of the night falls on October Square .
On television , President Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko and members of the Central El@@ ection Committee welcomed their success .
The interview - B@@ lood becomes safe again
H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation , and its president , Dr. Franc@@ ine Dé@@ c@@ ary , had reason to re@@ jo@@ ice , because H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec has become one of the saf@@ est and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world .
And most importantly , it has reg@@ ained the confidence of the public who had been seriously sha@@ ken by the tain@@ ted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s .
As we know , national reserves managed by the blood trans@@ fusion service of the Canadian Red Cross had been infected by human imm@@ un@@ o@@ defic@@ i@@ ency virus ( HIV ) and h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis C during the 1980s .
Fac@@ ed with this tragedy and public dis@@ content , the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry , headed by Justice Hor@@ ace Kre@@ ver , which aimed at sh@@ ed@@ ding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again .
While Ju@@ dge Kre@@ ver delayed in fil@@ ing his report , some provin@@ ces set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada .
In Qu@@ eb@@ ec , the committee G@@ é@@ lin@@ eau has fulfilled that mandate .
In the wake of the G@@ é@@ lin@@ eau and Kre@@ ver reports , two suppliers were created in Canada : H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec to serve Qu@@ eb@@ ec and Canadian B@@ lood Supp@@ ly for all other provin@@ ces and the two territories .
&quot; In 1998 , when H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec began operations , only 38 % of people still had confidence in the blood system in Qu@@ eb@@ ec , rem@@ embers Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary .
The situation was dis@@ cour@@ aging .
By d@@ int of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed , we have reg@@ ained the confidence of the public &quot; , she says before pro@@ u@@ dly affir@@ ming that at the beginning of 2008 , nearly 94 % of Qu@@ eb@@ ec &apos;s population now had confidence in H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec .
Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary , nonetheless , thinks &quot; confidence is something extremely fragile &quot; .
From its inc@@ eption on the 28 September 1998 , H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec has applied the precautionary principle .
At that time , there were in Europe with the out@@ break of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease , a new vari@@ ant of the Cre@@ utz@@ fel@@ d@@ t-@@ Jak@@ ob disease , said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998 .
&quot; And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood .
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Kre@@ ver and G@@ é@@ lin@@ eau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result , in this case Cre@@ utz@@ fel@@ d@@ t-@@ Jak@@ ob disease which is characterized by a de@@ generation of the brain leading inevitably to death , one establishes an excluding action .
In April 1999 , the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused .
But a few years ago , it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood .
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense . &quot;
In 1999 , on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing : the nu@@ c@@ lei@@ c acid testing ( N@@ AT ) allowed to detect directly in don@@ ated blood the virus itself rather than anti@@ bodies against the virus , which is what previous tests were based on .
The T@@ AN helped to shor@@ ten the silent period , which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques , the specialist explains .
It was able to reduce that period to less than a week .
Thus , it has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them .
These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood trans@@ fusion .
Today , a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contam@@ inated blood .
&quot; In other words , this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV .
Since H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec each year distri@@ butes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products , it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs .
I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescri@@ bing a blood trans@@ fusion to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate our health &quot; , affir@@ med the CEO of H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec .
&quot; Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products .
One never knows what disease will emerge in the system .
As recently as last year , there appeared on the island of Re@@ union the Chi@@ k@@ ung@@ unya virus which , like the West Ni@@ le virus , is transmitted by an ins@@ ect in the blood .
We must be constantly vigil@@ ant , &quot; continues Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary before empha@@ si@@ zing that in addition to a secure supply , H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec must also provide them in sufficient quantities .
&quot; The demand is increasing as the population ages .
The treatments being more aggressive , patients often need to re@@ fill in red blood cells or plat@@ el@@ ets .
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3 % of Qu@@ eb@@ ec@@ ers eligible to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
Any healthy person , aged 18 and over fits the su@@ it@@ ability criteria to give blood every 56 days , six times a year .
On average , 14 % of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or mal@@ aria , for example , and if they have trav@@ elled in a country where mal@@ aria is ri@@ fe , they would be excluded for a period of one year .
&quot; With these 3 % , we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals .
The short@@ ages are very rare .
But we must rene@@ w the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot don@@ ate their blood .
It is difficult to convince people to don@@ ate their blood , but even more so to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors .
Life today runs so fast , there is rarely time to find an hour to don@@ ate one &apos;s blood &quot; , says Franc@@ ine Dé@@ c@@ ary mis@@ er@@ ably .
With an annual budget of $ 29@@ 7 million , H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec provides not only blood products , but also tis@@ sues , including bone gra@@ fts , heart val@@ ves , ey@@ eb@@ alls and skin that is almost exclusively used for large bur@@ ns .
These tis@@ sues are analy@@ zed , processed and frozen before being stored at H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec , which manages also the only bank of plac@@ ental blood in Qu@@ eb@@ ec .
The um@@ bi@@ lical cor@@ d that was once regarded as biom@@ edi@@ cal waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leu@@ ka@@ em@@ ia .
&quot; A few weeks ago , we celebrated the banking of the thous@@ and@@ th sample of plac@@ ental cor@@ d blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year .
We should start to propose transplan@@ ts at the beginning of next year , &quot; says Dr. Dé@@ c@@ ary descri@@ bing this program for collecting plac@@ ental cor@@ d blood as very popular .
&quot; Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it &quot; because H@@ é@@ ma-@@ Qu@@ é@@ bec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Qu@@ eb@@ ec .
S@@ occ@@ er - Imp@@ act in the semi-@@ fin@@ als
The Montreal Imp@@ act has qualified for the semi-@@ final round of the play@@ off@@ s for the first division of US@@ L , thanks to a 3-@@ 1 victory ( 4-@@ 3 in total goals ) at the expense of the Seattle So@@ under@@ s , yesterday , during the second and decisive game of the series quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als on total goals at the S@@ ap@@ u@@ to Stadium .
The mid@@ fiel@@ der Antonio Ri@@ bei@@ ro sc@@ ored the decisive goal in the 90@@ th minute on Thursday .
After a first half with nothing but aim@@ lessly going from one side to another , mid@@ fiel@@ der David T@@ es@@ to and Roc@@ co Plan@@ cent@@ ino marked the net of the Montreal formation .
Rog@@ er Lev@@ esque was the only one to beat Mat@@ t Jordan for the So@@ under@@ s .
Rec@@ all that during the first game of the series rounds , on Friday , the Imp@@ act suffered a 2-@@ 1 defeat at the Star@@ fire Comp@@ lex in Tu@@ k@@ wi@@ la , a sub@@ ur@@ b of Seattle .
The Imp@@ acts will have to measure up to the Vancou@@ ver Whit@@ ec@@ aps in the semi-@@ final .
Saturday night at M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota , Th@@ under filled a 3-@@ 1 deficit in the return match to win 4-@@ 3 , but Whit@@ ec@@ aps nevertheless acc@@ eded to the semi-@@ final round 5-@@ 4 on total goals .
Imp@@ act will face the Whit@@ ec@@ aps on Friday and Sunday , but the details of the series will be confirmed today .
In brief – Ko@@ val@@ ev &apos;s vic@@ t@@ orious aim
The Canadian number one tri@@ o is ready for the season .
The unit consisting of A@@ lex Ko@@ val@@ ev , T@@ omas Ple@@ kan@@ ec and An@@ drei Ko@@ sti@@ ts@@ yn led the attack for a Canadian win of 3-@@ 2 in a sho@@ ot@@ out against the Florida Pan@@ thers last night at the B@@ ell Centre .
Ko@@ sti@@ ts@@ yn , the star of the first meeting , sc@@ ored a goal , Ple@@ kan@@ ec has raised two ai@@ des , and Ko@@ val@@ ev has collected a pass in this win , the Hab@@ s &apos; fourth in six preparatory games .
Ko@@ val@@ ev gained the victory by sc@@ oring the only goal of the sho@@ ot@@ out .
&quot; I am not yet ready , warned the Russian .
I need another match to feel at ease . &quot;
&quot; He tried to do too much in the first period , Gu@@ y Car@@ bon@@ ne@@ au noted .
But I think he appreciated the way the match ended .
He had a nice ov@@ ation . &quot;
Char@@ est placed on the North
The prime minister does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished , Jean Char@@ est yesterday visited Jean-@@ Tal@@ on , Qu@@ eb@@ ec City , where the new health minister , Y@@ ves Bol@@ duc ( left ) is trying to get elected in the by-@@ election today .
&quot; P@@ us@@ hing the limits of our last great northern fron@@ tier &quot; : this is the long-term ambition that Jean Char@@ est presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Qu@@ eb@@ ec , in Lev@@ is yesterday .
Beh@@ ind him , during his speech , a kind of mill of images was proj@@ ected .
Rot@@ ating in a lo@@ op on three huge screens , were dramatic pictures of hydro@@ electric dam@@ s , mining developments , of Qu@@ eb@@ ec seen through &quot; Google M@@ aps &quot; , maps , etc .
Like the mass media during elections .
Moreover , as a point to emphasise , the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this fall , although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy .
The &quot; North Plan &quot; is the fourth part of a &quot; vision &quot; that the prime minister claims to have for Qu@@ eb@@ ec , that of a &quot; new economic space &quot; , which includes an agreement on labour with France , an agreement between Canada and Europe , and agreements with On@@ t@@ ario .
O@@ ften mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently , the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 4@@ 9th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation .
The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was &quot; a je@@ wel with an immense potential &quot; , but never given its due chance , investment money , or specific priority in future projects .
At most , a few aven@@ ues that could be further developed : including hydro@@ power , the forest , but most of the entire mining sector , boo@@ sted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure .
The North contains &quot; nick@@ el , z@@ inc , copper , plat@@ in@@ um , gold , silver , iron , tit@@ anium , and even diam@@ onds &quot; , according to Mr. Char@@ est &apos;s list .
This territory is twice the size of France &quot; , &quot; it is here with us , it is in Qu@@ eb@@ ec .
Not only is it with us , but it &apos;s also us &quot; , he insi@@ sted , to better show this he so@@ lic@@ ited a national founding my@@ th .
The province has built much by its relationship with the North , he said : the gold r@@ ush in A@@ bi@@ ti@@ bi , Qu@@ eb@@ ec engineering , James &apos;s Bay .
&quot; We , our future , &quot; he added after a theat@@ ri@@ cal pause contem@@ pl@@ ating the immense map behind him .
The North , 70 % of Qu@@ eb@@ ec , includes a portion of Lab@@ rad@@ or that Qu@@ eb@@ ec has always claimed &quot; , said the Prime Minister at the press brief@@ ing .
&quot; This is a traditional position that all governments have reiter@@ ated .
There is a border along which there has been no agreement for too long a time and , when the opportunity arises , I reiterate this position there on behalf of government &quot; , he said .
Moreover , &quot; with the climate changes , we must re@@ think our vision of the North &quot; , he declared , referring to the Nor@@ thwest Pass@@ age , to be held open throughout the year due to mel@@ ting ice .
In this new geopoli@@ tical context , the Prime Minister considers occup@@ ying the territory a duty .
And the inhabitants of the territory , First Nations and In@@ u@@ it ?
The Prime Minister said that the Qu@@ eb@@ ec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would benefit them , especially to young people .
Two former ministers from two different parties , Pierre Cor@@ bei@@ l and Michel L@@ é@@ tour@@ ne@@ au ( former member Un@@ g@@ ava P@@ Q ) , have already started consultations with thirty communities .
An inter-@@ minist@@ erial committee ch@@ ai@@ red by Ben@@ o@@ it Pel@@ le@@ tier , in which Ju@@ lie Bou@@ let ( Transport and Natural Resour@@ ces ) has an important place , started work .
The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting , &quot; not necessarily a summit , &quot; but a time when &quot; we give ourselves a common vision . &quot;
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development .
The North will be &quot; coordinated , or@@ derly and resp@@ ect@@ ful of the environment &quot; , he promised .
Jean Char@@ est described this &quot; vision &quot; as continuous with that of the Liberal prime minister who preced@@ ed him .
&quot; As the Liberals who have preced@@ ed us , we have altern@@ atively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development . &quot;
This has been one of the recur@@ ring themes of the weekend , which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50@@ th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Les@@ age at the head of the party .
One of the resolutions proposed to ren@@ ame the Central Beau@@ har@@ no@@ is D@@ am in Ad@@ é@@ lar@@ d-@@ Go@@ d@@ b@@ out .
&quot; From Go@@ d@@ b@@ out , who created Hydro@@ -@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec , to Les@@ age who made the Qu@@ i@@ et Revolution and the nation@@ alization of hydro@@ electricity , to Bour@@ ass@@ a who made James Bay , our party has managed to forge the future &quot; , declared Jean Char@@ est .
In the press brief@@ ing , he inv@@ oked another reference , conservative as this , the program &quot; Ro@@ ads to the North &quot; by John Di@@ ef@@ en@@ b@@ aker , prime minister from 1957 to 1963 .
Ad@@ dres@@ sing the proposed hydro@@ electric dam of E@@ ast@@ main@@ 1@@ a-@@ R@@ up@@ er , Mr. Char@@ est has stressed that it should become operational for 2012 .
&quot; Between us , but I plan to be there , &quot; he told activists , el@@ ic@@ iting from them a huge round of appl@@ ause .
Indeed , the Prime Minister , who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009 , has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall , it is what the law permits him .
He stressed that his schedule is filled up , notably by a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Qu@@ eb@@ ec@@ -@@ New York summit .
The weekend &apos;s General Council provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nation@@ alists resolutions , notably some &quot; constitutional aspirations &quot; which passed through like a bree@@ ze : the PL@@ Q in particular calls for the recognition of the &quot; specific@@ ity of Qu@@ eb@@ ec in the Constitution .
It also wants Qu@@ eb@@ ec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telec@@ omm@@ unications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Qu@@ eb@@ ec .
On the opposition side , the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scep@@ ticism .
The P@@ Q leader , Pau@@ line Mar@@ ois , has brought up again the policy development of Northern Qu@@ eb@@ ec that the Land@@ ry government had launched in 2001 .
According to her , the Liberal government , when it came into power in 2003 , had wai@@ ved the application .
H@@ ad it done so , &quot; it would be more advanced today , &quot; comm@@ ented M@@ s. Mar@@ ois alongside her candidate in Jean-@@ Tal@@ on ( bal@@ lot which takes place today ) , Franç@@ o@@ ise Mercure .
The AD@@ Q has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government .
&quot; But what is desired , is that it is not just for show &quot; , said the leader S@@ é@@ bas@@ tien Pro@@ ul@@ x , replacing Mario D@@ um@@ ont , who returned from vacation today .
Let@@ ters - A country dish@@ on@@ oured
It is Mr. V@@ ic To@@ e@@ ws , former Minister of Justice &quot; ( oh ir@@ ony ) in the Har@@ per cab@@ inet , which allowed himself last summer to say that Lou@@ ise Ar@@ bor was a &quot; shame &quot; for Canada .
Thus casting op@@ prob@@ ri@@ um on the woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admir@@ ation also speaks volumes about the ent@@ our@@ age of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Har@@ per himself .
Here , we have before us a government that is the only one among all western countries involved , not to have re@@ patri@@ ated its nationals locked in the concentration camp at Guant@@ an@@ amo .
A government which ign@@ ores the fact that Om@@ ar K@@ ha@@ d@@ r was a young teen@@ ager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged .
The only government that , despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention , has gone back on his word and let langu@@ ish in in@@ humane conditions a child soldi@@ er .
The only one that rel@@ ies on a trav@@ esty of justice to assess the gu@@ ilt of the accused .
Remember , for the record , that UN@@ ICE@@ F , Am@@ nesty International and the Canadian Bar Association , among others , ple@@ aded for the re@@ patri@@ ation of Om@@ ar K@@ ha@@ d@@ r so that he receives a fair trial in Canada .
This same government turns a blind eye to torture : little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psych@@ ologically destroyed , doub@@ t@@ lessly forever , after so many years of abuses .
One does not yet realise , but we are witn@@ essing right now a cre@@ eping ero@@ sion of our rights , of our liber@@ ties , and our &quot; democracy &quot; , this word that Har@@ per continues to bran@@ dish and that sounds hol@@ low in his mouth .
Now comes the time when there are no more mor@@ als : one can bul@@ ly , torture , arbitr@@ arily det@@ ain a Canadian citizen at the whi@@ m of the head of a minor government so far ( so what will happen so after 14 October ... ) .
A number of voters believe they will find sal@@ vation in a party that advocates Virtu@@ e , Law , and Order : they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country .
Sh@@ ame , Mr. To@@ e@@ ws , it is here , in this ren@@ unci@@ ation , and not elsewhere .
Free opinion - The Or@@ wel@@ lian speech Barri@@ ck Gold
In its September 17 edition , Le Dev@@ o@@ ir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Gar@@ ver , executive vic@@ e-@@ president of the Canadian mining Barri@@ ck Gold .
Following an Or@@ wel@@ lian logic , it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a de@@ fam@@ ation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a p@@ enny in order to launch a &quot; transparent public debate &quot; .
While it is true that the judges are independent and im@@ partial , especially in the cases of de@@ fam@@ ation , they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law .
Not surpris@@ ingly , this difference is completely obs@@ cur@@ ed by Mr. Gar@@ ver .
Since , for Barri@@ ck Gold , the best way for it to conduct a public debate is to ru@@ in anyone who dar@@ es to support a contrary position ?
Reg@@ ard@@ less of the trial &apos;s outcome , the authors and publish@@ er of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight , with very un@@ equal resources , against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bot@@ tom@@ less po@@ ckets of mining .
The tac@@ tics , in these un@@ equal stru@@ gg@@ les , is often to ru@@ in the def@@ end@@ ants with the aim of imposing a settlement that sil@@ ences the opposition and in addition fri@@ gh@@ tens anyone who dar@@ es to think of re@@ opening the issue .
If Barri@@ ck Gold really wanted a public debate , it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to what is done in several countries where Barri@@ ck Gold operates , the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not of b@@ aton th@@ umps .
Thus , it would have been sufficient for the mining company to open its books , records and establish a real debate , through newspapers , the media , publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue .
But Barri@@ ck Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand peti@@ tions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada .
Perhaps Mr Gar@@ ver could explain how he can both call for a &quot; public &quot; debate while at the same time dis@@ regarding the views of that very same audience ?
In the world of the Vice-President , it seems that this word refers only to high priced lawyers and not to all Canadi@@ ans : that is a rather narrow view of the concept .
In a democracy , even the critics have the right to speak .
What Barri@@ ck Gold does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writers and publish@@ ers of Black Canada , does so primarily because it re@@ jects its brutal mining methods .
The public is ready to hear Barri@@ ck and judge , but on the basis of a civili@@ zed exchange of arguments , and not as part of what many perc@@ eive as a prosec@@ u@@ tion-@@ ga@@ g ( continuing the &quot; public debate &quot; , Barri@@ ck Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ... ) .
Beyond the Mr. Gar@@ ver &apos;s sur@@ real speech , the continuation of Barri@@ ck Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth , essential for any democratic society .
It den@@ ies , coll@@ ectively , the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpre@@ tations , which represents the very basis of intellectual work .
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects un@@ pal@@ at@@ able to the weal@@ thy corporations in the world in a country like Canada , under penalty of repeated prosec@@ ution , who can do it ?
If Barri@@ ck Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate , it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada .
She has a right to reply .
The ac@@ ade@@ mia , to which we belong , has long been managing the debates and dis@@ agreements , and resolving conflicts .
Barri@@ ck Gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that , contrary to its claims , it did not want a transparent debate .
It is a loss for ac@@ ade@@ mia , as well as for public debate in Canada , and it is time that governments put in place devices that limit such fri@@ vol@@ ous practices .
Operation Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republic@@ ans agree
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress , both the Republic@@ ans and the Democrats , finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30@@ s .
The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollars plan to cur@@ b the financial crisis that ro@@ cked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress .
In particular , it fores@@ ees : a better control by elected officials of its implementation , new mechanisms to ensure re@@ payment of public money committed , new provisions to limit the number of houses sei@@ zed for non-@@ payment , as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to exec@@ u@@ tives of companies rescu@@ ed .
U.S. Treas@@ ury Secretary , Henry Pau@@ l@@ son , the chairman of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si , and Republic@@ an representative to the negotiating table , Sen@@ ator Ju@@ d@@ d Greg@@ g , announced the good news a few minutes after mid@@ night yesterday , following a mar@@ athon two-@@ day negotiations .
&quot; We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market , &quot; declared the representative of the Bush administration , Henry Pau@@ l@@ son .
&quot; Everything has been done in order to shi@@ eld the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street , &quot; said the Democ@@ rat .
&quot; This is the fundamental point : if we do not do this , the trau@@ ma , chaos and dis@@ ruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense , &quot; declared Republic@@ an Ju@@ d@@ d Greg@@ g .
The negotiations turned into a sprin@@ t in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors .
The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning .
Associ@@ ated late to the negotiations , the two American presidential candidates were rather suppor@@ tive to the agreement , without failing , however , to express their dis@@ satisfaction that one is comp@@ elled to reach this extreme .
Democratic Sen@@ ator Barack Obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement , particularly those that enable owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescu@@ ed by the state .
&quot; When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the ir@@ responsibility of some , there is nothing to congratulate .
But these measures are necessary , &quot; he comm@@ ented on the air@@ waves of American television .
A@@ sk@@ ed by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan , his Republic@@ an oppon@@ ent , John Mc@@ C@@ ain , responded : &quot; I would like to see the details , but I hope so . &quot;
&quot; The outline that I read &#91; show &#93; that this is something we will all have to di@@ gest and with which we can go for@@ wards .
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable &quot; , he said .
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts , assets at risk and uns@@ ell@@ able U.S. financial institutions .
It comes after a 14 month crisis trig@@ gered by the bur@@ sting of a housing bub@@ ble which first led to the collapse of ris@@ ky mort@@ g@@ ages ( sub@@ prime ) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles ( P@@ CA@@ A ) and leading to a free@@ ze of liquidity and the st@@ am@@ pe@@ de of banks and financial institutions .
This is a group of elected Republic@@ ans who had der@@ ailed the first draft agreement last week .
It is believed to have come out of this imp@@ asse ever since the Democrats have agreed that certain &quot; toxic &quot; shares of companies in difficulty are only ins@@ ured by the government , rather than purchased .
To round off the cor@@ ners for everyone in Congress , a provision has also been added stipul@@ ating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program , it could introduce new taxes to help recover its investment .
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tran@@ che of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the President de@@ ems necessary .
The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress .
In exchange for its support , Washington will get st@@ akes in the companies it has rescu@@ ed , earning divi@@ den@@ ds in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed .
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the sei@@ z@@ ure of housing attached to mort@@ gage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and sever@@ ance packages paid to exec@@ u@@ tives of companies affected .
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives today , and the Sen@@ ate on Wednesday .
Despite all their efforts , it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light .
Vo@@ ices have indeed continued to be raised against the project yesterday , both in the Republic@@ an camp as well as by the Democrats .
&quot; Obviously , Washington does not hear you , &quot; said while addressing his constitu@@ ents the Republic@@ an Scott Gar@@ ret@@ t , a member of the Finance Committee of the House .
&quot; Yes , we have a serious financial problem .
Yes , solutions do exist .
But not ones that take advantage of taxpayers &quot; .
Le@@ ader of a small group in Congress du@@ b@@ bed &quot; the Sc@@ ep@@ tics &apos; C@@ auc@@ us &quot; , the Democratic representative Bra@@ d Sher@@ man presents things differently , but reaches the same conclusion .
&quot; Four hundred prominent prof@@ essors of economics , including three Nobel Prize winners , have written to tell us : one asks the Congress not to hur@@ ry and to examine carefully the way forward &quot; , he said yesterday .
At the same time , Europe has once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis .
After an emergency meeting , the three Ben@@ el@@ ux countries have announced the partial nation@@ alization of the banking group For@@ tis for 11.@@ 2 billion Euro ( 16.@@ 3 billion U.S. ) .
The intervention of the governments of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ bas has indicated that it would ren@@ ounce acqu@@ iring its ri@@ val in full bank@@ rupt@@ cy since it has lost 2 billion Euro ( 2.@@ 9 billion U.S. ) in the ris@@ ky mort@@ g@@ ages crisis in the United States .
For@@ tis emplo@@ ys 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest ins@@ ur@@ ers .
&quot; This is not lost money , declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister , W@@ outer B@@ os .
In return , we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence .
It &apos;s just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead . &quot;
Meanwhile , across the Channel , the British government seems about to nation@@ alize another bank hit by the financial crisis .
According to the English press , the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Bra@@ d@@ ford and B@@ ing@@ ley , including more than 41 billion ( 7@@ 5.@@ 5 billion U.S. ) in real estate loans .
The Spanish bank Sant@@ ander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank .
The Bra@@ d@@ ford and B@@ ing@@ ley would be the second bank , after the Northern Rock , the British government will have to nation@@ alize since the beginning of this financial crisis .
Paul New@@ man ( 19@@ 25-@@ 2008 ) - De@@ ath of an true icon
His beauty and his blue eyes were for a long time his main asset , some would say his weakness .
Did he free himself from this nar@@ c@@ iss@@ istic mirror , this American actor with the charming s@@ mile ?
Yes and no .
His mo@@ dest@@ y , his sensitivity and an abund@@ ance of talent would have also distan@@ ced him from the power register which gives birth to real sac@@ red mon@@ sters .
But what a great run@@ ner till the end !
Paul New@@ man , who died on Friday , aged 83 , as a result of lung cancer at his ran@@ ch in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the years of sp@@ l@@ end@@ our .
L@@ ess monum@@ ental than Br@@ ando , who he res@@ emb@@ led and was a long time sort of ri@@ val on the screen , more cau@@ tious in his game , certainly more fragile , but also an a@@ post@@ le of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions .
Mix@@ ed blood children are often magnificent .
He was born in O@@ hi@@ o in 19@@ 25 , from a Jewish German father and a mother of Hungarian origin .
From these European roots were born the gl@@ orious faces of the American dream .
Without an excessive ego , the ultimate mark of quality .
Because in him is portra@@ yed a countr@@ y-@@ lo@@ ving self made man , a comb@@ at@@ ant in the Pacific War , wo@@ unded in combat , who in the early 50 &apos;s studied drama at Y@@ ale and attended the Ac@@ tor &apos;s Studio in New York , before tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ing at the theatre , on television , soon after at the cinema .
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ran@@ ked second in the 24 H@@ ours Le M@@ ans in 1979 , doub@@ led as a sex symbol , albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the act@@ ress Jo@@ anne Woo@@ d@@ ward .
Also dis@@ appearing with him are the shad@@ ow@@ y areas of this secret star , discre@@ et , committed , all@@ erg@@ ic to the sc@@ and@@ als of show business , which have definitely not pen@@ etr@@ ated the en@@ ig@@ ma .
An honest man in the no@@ bl@@ est sense of the word .
The dis@@ appearance of Paul New@@ man brought ver@@ tig@@ o to mo@@ vi@@ eg@@ o@@ ers this weekend , while his major roles col@@ li@@ de on the black screen of memories .
More than half a century of a s@@ eventh American art which is constantly changing sc@@ roll@@ s through him .
Rus@@ hing back into memory are the charming co@@ w@@ boy in But@@ ch C@@ assi@@ dy and the S@@ und@@ ance K@@ id ( 1969 ) , the young man rej@@ ecting his sen@@ su@@ al wife ( Eli@@ zab@@ eth Tay@@ lor ) in The C@@ at on a Hot T@@ in Ro@@ of adapted from Tenn@@ es@@ see Willi@@ ams in 1958 .
C@@ loser to us ( 1990 ) , one ev@@ ok@@ es his sensitive Mr. Bridge , distur@@ bed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promises .
So many other Paul New@@ man have passed into history .
The box@@ er Ro@@ cky Gra@@ zi@@ ano , del@@ inqu@@ ent , tor@@ m@@ ented , violent , unforgettable in Som@@ ebody Up There Li@@ kes Me ( marked by hat@@ red ) , Robert W@@ ise , a role dest@@ ined for James D@@ ean , taken after his death , which really launched New@@ man in 1956 .
This friendly cro@@ ok in the most brilliant The St@@ ing , O@@ scar for best film in 1973 .
Billi@@ ard player bitter and ven@@ ge@@ ful in the magnificent The Hu@@ st@@ ler by Robert Ro@@ ssen ( 1961 ) , he took up again the character on his return in The Color of Money by Martin S@@ cor@@ s@@ ese , who in 1987 won him his only O@@ scar with nine nom@@ inations .
This face throughout the ages , it was him .
H@@ im again .
Er@@ as jo@@ st@@ le by through his journey .
Young people know him mainly through the cul@@ t of S@@ l@@ ap S@@ hot by George Ro@@ y Hill ( 1977 ) , as Reg@@ g@@ ie Dun@@ l@@ op , the coach of an un@@ orthodo@@ x ice ho@@ ck@@ ey team .
His fans met him again in 1994 in The Hu@@ d@@ su@@ cker Pro@@ xy by the Co@@ en brothers .
With a last role as the go@@ d@@ father of an Irish ma@@ fia in Road to Per@@ dition by S@@ am Men@@ des in 2003 , the lo@@ op was closed .
Unlike several leg@@ ends of the cinema who have dropped the trade early , New@@ man has remained in the s@@ add@@ le for a long time , while den@@ o@@ unc@@ ing Hollywood , its gold , its sp@@ l@@ end@@ our and its concessions .
The French film@@ maker Ber@@ tr@@ and Ta@@ ver@@ nier considered him , not without hum@@ our , &quot; as a living challenge to &quot; under@@ playing &quot; jud@@ ging his performances too supported .
The profession has not always been easy with the beautiful Paul New@@ man to whom roles came for a long time easy as p@@ ie .
He played though less often , in his first young roles , margin@@ al characters : neur@@ o@@ tics , alcoho@@ lic@@ s , b@@ ast@@ ards or desper@@ ate men , with his perfect tra@@ its reflecting the exc@@ esses and the re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous .
As director , New@@ man revealed a little known aspect of his modest real sensitivity .
His R@@ ach@@ el , R@@ ach@@ el , in 1968 ( based on the novel by the Canadian Margar@@ et Laur@@ ence ) , with his wife Jo@@ anne Woo@@ d@@ ward in the lead role , drew a fine female portra@@ it of mel@@ anch@@ oly .
He lost his son Scott to an over@@ dose to whom he dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984 , out of dec@@ ency and s@@ ad@@ ness .
Among the rain of tri@@ butes that fell on New@@ man yesterday , his great friend and former comp@@ an@@ ion in arms Robert Red@@ ford ( they played together in The St@@ ing , and But@@ ch C@@ assi@@ dy and the S@@ und@@ ance K@@ id ) said , very s@@ ad@@ dened : &quot; His presence has made my life and this country better . &quot;
Gener@@ o@@ sity , love of life are the features of the vibrant actor just disappeared .
Beyond his legendary career , also er@@ ased was a great activ@@ ist for civil rights , ec@@ ology , the independent cinema , a prot@@ est@@ or against the exc@@ esses of Hollywood .
We saw his mu@@ g shots on a lot of j@@ ars of sal@@ ad dres@@ sing , sau@@ ces , bis@@ cu@@ its , and other foodstuffs , jud@@ ging the process fairly tast@@ eless , although a ga@@ g at the outset .
Prof@@ its from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty .
New@@ man , rather than sit on his my@@ th , has remained committed until the end .
He left his five dau@@ gh@@ ters a letter containing these words : &quot; Al@@ ways and to the end , your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortun@@ e .
It has been a privilege being there . &quot;
And a privilege for us to have followed the trail of such a lu@@ ci@@ d and generous American artist .
A model citizen , in sum and in addition .
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zu@@ schlag and his compani@@ ons ?
The conduct of the criminal prosec@@ ution of J@@ á@@ nos Zu@@ schlag and his compani@@ ons will be started on 8th October .
The politi@@ cian and his compani@@ ons have been accused of taking part continuously and on a professional basis in a fraud causing significant damages , as well as in other criminal activities , including for@@ gery .
According to the prosec@@ ution , they used the awarded tender funds for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by f@@ ake invo@@ ices .
The state and municipal funds - H@@ U@@ F 65 million in total - have been shared between the organization Fi@@ at@@ al Bal@@ ol@@ dal and other people .
The methodology - which has been published by the investig@@ ating authority , too - was to use b@@ ills of costs with un@@ real performance in order to access the awarded tender funds . This way the associations never met the agreed undertakings .
Most of the invo@@ ices were false according to the indic@@ t@@ ment .
The invoice templates were acquired in the J@@ ó@@ z@@ se@@ f@@ vá@@ ros market and the round st@@ amps were manufactured in Kis@@ kun@@ hal@@ as .
The selection of the companies in the name of which the b@@ ills were issued was completed on a trip in western Hungary , where J@@ á@@ nos Zu@@ schlag sent I@@ st@@ v@@ án Lad@@ os .
According to the testim@@ ony of the latter one , he was ordered to select pensions and restaurants .
He asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place , and based on this invoice they prepared the invo@@ ices to be submitted to the ten@@ ders called for by institutes such as the Ministry of Youth and Sports , the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Mun@@ icip@@ ality of Budapest .
These were submitted mainly by I@@ st@@ v@@ án Lad@@ os and his comp@@ an@@ ion , Andr@@ ás Ő@@ ri , who was responsible for writing the reports required to qualify for the support .
One of Lad@@ os &apos;s &quot; study visits &quot; was to a be@@ er-@@ house .
According to the invoice dated 2003 and issued by Zu@@ schlag and his compani@@ ons , the establishment provided food for a group of 90 people , who were members of the association B@@ iz@@ tos P@@ ont E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let .
However , as the director of the company states , the establishment does not even have the capacity to provide seats for such a great number of people .
The invoice submitted in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt - which was later ren@@ amed to E@@ gy@@ üt@@ t a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ red@@ é@@ rt - also contained several mistakes in its form and content .
The bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3-@@ room pension in Bad@@ ac@@ son@@ y@@ tom@@ a@@ j , which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people .
The imagin@@ ative f@@ ill@@ ers of the invo@@ ices went also too far when they indicated P@@ ig@@ al K@@ ft@@ . in the documents . It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accus@@ ation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt and H@@ opp@@ á .
Gy@@ ő@@ z@@ ő F@@ ark@@ as , director of the firm said to h@@ v@@ g@@ .@@ h@@ u that when he was sum@@ mon@@ ed and the invo@@ ices were shown to him , he recognised their false nature immediately .
&quot; The name and tax number of our company were placed incorrec@@ tly on the st@@ amp . &quot;
And he added that , moreover , the invoice had been issued for the accommodation of 100 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 11 rooms , which did not have the capacity for so many people .
In addition , the bill included catering as well , though their restaurant had not been in function for long .
The enthusiastic b@@ ill-@@ makers were not aware of the fact that the Bud@@ ap@@ est@@ -based travel agency that they selected organiz@@ es foreign tours only , thus the indicated Hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coinci@@ de with the invoice issuing practice of the firm .
Furthermore , - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also indicated VAT on the document in spite of the fact that the transport activities to foreign countries other than the European Union were exemp@@ t from VAT .
The degree of VAT , which has been shown in four documents issued by Hotel Ré@@ v@@ fü@@ lö@@ p K@@ ft@@ . to the foundation J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt , was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 15 % , instead of the indicated 25 % . Additionally , the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machin@@ e-@@ made invo@@ ices , while the reviewed b@@ ills were manually prepared .
The invo@@ ic@@ e-@@ issu@@ ers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosec@@ ution procedure . This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting .
The f@@ ake nature of the b@@ ills issued to E@@ gy@@ üt@@ t a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ red@@ é@@ rt Al@@ ap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny , XX@@ I . Sz@@ á@@ z@@ a@@ di Kultur@@ á@@ lis E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let and B@@ iz@@ tos P@@ ont was disclos@@ ed due to formal devi@@ ations such as inappropriate b@@ illing format and for@@ ged st@@ amp .
Just like in the case of Rav@@ enna B@@ t@@ . or the Sport@@ camp of Kun@@ feh@@ ér@@ t@@ ó , the representatives of which denied having issued the b@@ ills .
The for@@ gers did not even pay attention to the fact that the Ny@@ í@@ reg@@ y@@ h@@ á@@ za based H@@ I@@ B K@@ ft@@ . was under liqui@@ dation at the time ( 2001 ) when a group from Fi@@ at@@ al V@@ á@@ ro@@ sé@@ rt E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let alle@@ ge@@ dly had lunch there . The in@@ solven@@ cy practi@@ tion@@ er denied having issued the document .
Is@@ su@@ ed consci@@ ously
The other group of the invo@@ ic@@ e-@@ issu@@ ers consists of those having been aware of issuing fic@@ ti@@ tious invo@@ ices .
The foundation Es@@ é@@ ly Bud@@ ap@@ est@@ é@@ rt Al@@ ap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny issued an invoice of about four million for@@ ints for on the request of Fi@@ at@@ al Bal@@ ol@@ dal - I@@ f@@ j@@ ú S@@ zo@@ ci@@ al@@ ist@@ á@@ k . This invoice was issued to the foundation E@@ gy@@ üt@@ t a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ red@@ é@@ rt .
According to the indic@@ t@@ ment , the director of Coll@@ ab K@@ ft@@ . was encouraged by one of the def@@ end@@ ants , Lu@@ do@@ vic Gy@@ ör@@ fi , to prepare a fic@@ ti@@ tious invoice .
Bi@@ og@@ ate K@@ ft . - which is currently under liqui@@ dation - also co@@ operated with Zu@@ schlag and his compani@@ ons . In 2003 the company provided the foundation J@@ ob@@ b J@@ ö@@ v@@ ő@@ é@@ rt Al@@ ap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny , the associations At@@ las@@ z E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let and V@@ ör@@ ös@@ fen@@ y@@ ő E@@ gy@@ es@@ ü@@ let with invo@@ ices of roughly H@@ U@@ F 5 million with no real economic activity behind .
There was no cash flow either since the issued invo@@ ices were vo@@ i@@ ded later , but the organizations for@@ got to indicate this in their documents .
The next category of the firms having issued the invo@@ ices are those being linked to the def@@ end@@ ants .
A good example for this is I@@ v@@ án Kub@@ at@@ ov , the delivery representative of the Ukrainian executive director of Delta Tri@@ ó K@@ ft@@ . having its headquarters in Budapest , but not to be found there , which deals with fuel and vehicle trade .
In October , November and December the company issued several invo@@ ices for selling comp@@ uting devices , in a value of approximately H@@ U@@ F 18 million .
According to the data of the investigation , these b@@ ills were purchased by the Kis@@ kun@@ hal@@ as@@ -based Cash Investment K@@ ft . , which has been under liqui@@ dation since 14 September 2005 .
The executive director of the abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned company was a Romanian man , to whom I@@ v@@ án Kub@@ at@@ ov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005 .
According to our information , Kub@@ at@@ ov admitted having issued b@@ ills to At@@ las@@ z , H@@ opp@@ á and E@@ gy@@ üt@@ t a Har@@ ma@@ di@@ k É@@ ve@@ z@@ red@@ é@@ rt Al@@ ap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny and received the amounts paid .
F@@ a-@@ Ban@@ i J@@ os F@@ ai@@ par@@ i K@@ ft@@ . and Jo@@ s-@@ Investment B@@ t@@ . were founded by Romanian mas@@ ons , specifically at the request of I@@ v@@ án Kub@@ at@@ ov .
However , neither of these firms operated actually , which the def@@ endant explained by lack of orders .
Still , he could take advantage of these undertakings ; for his request , att@@ or@@ ney Z@@ sol@@ t Sz@@ ente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invo@@ ices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Zu@@ schlag , namely for At@@ las@@ z and Y@@ -@@ Gener@@ á@@ ci@@ ó .
Kub@@ at@@ ov provided 15 invo@@ ices for the organizations in the name of Cash Investment , Delta Tri@@ ó , F@@ a-@@ Ban@@ i J@@ os , J@@ os Investment and Lin@@ ax@@ trade , with a total value of H@@ U@@ F 14.@@ 2 million .
According to the prosec@@ ution , 10 % of the amount indicated on the invo@@ ices and the amount of VAT was the share of Kub@@ at@@ ov .
He even had S@@ zi@@ -@@ Beri B@@ t@@ . issue fic@@ ti@@ tious invo@@ ices which were used for the tender of B@@ iz@@ tos P@@ ont .
In January 2006 Y@@ -@@ Gener@@ á@@ ci@@ ó and S@@ zö@@ v@@ et@@ sé@@ g a Modern Mag@@ yar@@ or@@ sz@@ á@@ g@@ é@@ rt submitted a tender to T@@ án@@ c@@ si@@ cs M@@ ih@@ á@@ ly Al@@ ap@@ í@@ t@@ vá@@ ny ( T@@ MA ) , which is a non-@@ profit organization of the socialist party .
They were awarded H@@ U@@ F 500@@ .000 each , but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender .
In order to avoid the fraud being disclos@@ ed , they submitted the 5 fic@@ ti@@ tious invo@@ ices issued by Works Team K@@ ft@@ . to T@@ MA .
These invo@@ ices were found - during the se@@ arches - in Á@@ r@@ p@@ á@@ d K@@ em@@ ec@@ sei &apos;s office located in the Ministry of Education .
Some def@@ end@@ ants are likely to conf@@ ess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the att@@ or@@ ney &apos;s department , too .
The most interesting part of the situation could be J@@ á@@ nos Zu@@ schlag &apos;s decision on disc@@ losing his sec@@ rets .
His testim@@ ony so far is not very detailed , and though he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case , he has not done so .
The question is whether he is interested in fulfilling his promise or - in return for the reimbur@@ sement of most of the damage ( 50 million for@@ ints ) , the soci@@ alists have struck a deal with him and Zu@@ si would rather take the ra@@ p .
Or he might just have taken off@@ ence since his requests regarding the allevi@@ ation of the conditions of his detention - in other words his being placed under house arrest - kept falling upon de@@ af ears .
While those who have committed the much more damaging and non-@@ compens@@ ated economic criminal activities can walk freely in the streets or wait at their home for the end of the legal procedure being conducted against them , he does not have the opportunity to do that .
The psych@@ ology of over@@ bi@@ d@@ ding : what do we spend more money on ?
At an auction , the customers tend to spend more money on a product and over@@ value it .
The neur@@ ologist and econom@@ ist researchers of New York University managed to disc@@ lose the neur@@ olog@@ ic@@ al-@@ economic basis of this well-known - and seem@@ ingly ir@@ rational - behaviour .
According to their study published in the perio@@ di@@ cal called Science , people don not want to lose in a competition like the auction of eBay , thus they rather pay an un@@ realis@@ tically high price .
The research aimed at ma@@ pping the neur@@ ological scheme of this &quot; game &quot; with the help of experimental auc@@ tions .
A group of volunte@@ ers was playing lot@@ tery and another group was taking part in an auction . In the mean@@ while , the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic res@@ on@@ ance ima@@ ging ( f@@ M@@ RI ) .
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which over@@ bi@@ d@@ ding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called stri@@ atum , situated under the cer@@ eb@@ ral cor@@ tex , was coming into operation upon the person &apos;s defeat .
This area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays role in the &quot; self-@@ rewar@@ ding &quot; mechanism of the ner@@ vous system .
Thus , according to the researchers , raising the price can be explained by the avo@@ idance of the violent reaction of the stri@@ atum .
In order to justify their theory , the econom@@ ist members of the research group conducted financial resear@@ ches as well .
In this research three groups were making bi@@ ds against someone , under various conditions .
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bi@@ ds .
Another group got a promise of receiving an extra amount of 15 dollars in case of their victory .
The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat , they would lose this amount .
As it seems , the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat .
Pro@@ ving the hypo@@ thesis of the neur@@ ologists , the members of the group &quot; playing for not losing money &quot; were ready to make higher bi@@ ds than the control group or the group &quot; playing for gaining money &quot; .
&quot; These results cannot be de@@ duced from any existing economic theory .
The earlier the@@ ories explained the phenomenon experienced at auc@@ tions by the delight of victory and risk avo@@ idance .
It was the neur@@ ological ima@@ ging methods that helped us to dis@@ solve the contradiction between the two the@@ ories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end &quot; , said Andrew Sch@@ ot@@ ter , professor of the economic fac@@ ul@@ ty of New York University .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis : when shall we turn to a doctor ?
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately half a billion people suffer from chronic h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis B or C infection . In Hungary , the chronic li@@ ver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mort@@ ality .
Although the number of the Hung@@ arians being infected by h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis can reach 100 000 , only 7 000 of them are treated properly . The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis is a collective name of different inf@@ ec@@ tious li@@ ver diseases caused by various viruses .
Even though there are simil@@ arities in the symptoms , e.g. li@@ ver infl@@ amm@@ ation or ja@@ un@@ dice , the nature of the pa@@ tho@@ gens and the caused diseases are different .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis viruses are transmitted in two main forms , depending on the type of the pa@@ tho@@ gens : h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A and E travel through the al@@ im@@ entary trac@@ t ( for example with infected food or water ) , h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis B , C , D and the other viruses are carried in blood and body flu@@ ids ( sem@@ en , v@@ ag@@ inal mu@@ cus , s@@ ali@@ va ) .
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vacc@@ ination ; but there is no vacc@@ ination against virus C.
The symptoms of h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having e@@ aten the contam@@ inated food ; they are accompanied by general mal@@ a@@ ise , weakness , ab@@ domin@@ al problems , n@@ aus@@ ea .
The next sign is ja@@ un@@ dice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye . Additional symptoms are : light coloured fa@@ eces , dark ur@@ ine . Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks .
An@@ nu@@ ally and worldwide , 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease , h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis B , causing li@@ ver cancer and cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver .
The main reason is that only an estimated one-@@ ten@@ th of the infected receive medical treatment .
H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis C can also lead to serious problems : it may result in cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the li@@ ver or li@@ ver cancer if it is not treated .
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness since the pa@@ tho@@ gens destroy the li@@ ver cells over a long time , thus in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later .
From this point , early prevention , especially regular screening tests have fundamental significance .
In three groups this illness is experienced highly above the average : among people having received blood trans@@ fusion before 1991 , dru@@ g-@@ ad@@ dic@@ ts and those having t@@ att@@ oos .
Currently , the number of people infected by chronic h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis C is around 200 million worldwide .
Since the disease can be recognized by routine laboratory testing , it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed .
In case of early recognition , the disease can be cur@@ ed , the virus can be destroyed , thus inf@@ ectiv@@ ity ce@@ ases and the in@@ duction of cancer can be prevented .
30 September is the World H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis Day , which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected .
It aims to call attention to chronic li@@ ver infl@@ amm@@ ation caused by viruses , the causes of its in@@ duction and the significance of early recognition .
Does it h@@ urt less if you believe in God ?
According to a recent research , religious belief can be used as a kind of pain k@@ iller , which could have e@@ ased the death of ca@@ tho@@ lic m@@ art@@ yr@@ s as well .
&quot; The scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believ@@ ing in God on the degree of people &apos;s sensitivity to pain &quot; , says the British T@@ eleg@@ raph .
Within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 ca@@ tho@@ lic bel@@ ie@@ vers and 12 ath@@ ei@@ sts were given electric shock . In the mean@@ while , all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary .
The results showed that the practi@@ sing Catho@@ lic@@ s were able to exclude most of their pain .
Due to the brain sc@@ anning technology , it turned out that the Catho@@ lic@@ s were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation .
This was the first experiment in a series of research , which besides academ@@ ici@@ ans includes scientists , philosoph@@ ers , the@@ ologi@@ ans from different departments of the university .
To be exact , a spark@@ ing object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunte@@ ers in the experiment .
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings ; S@@ asso@@ fer@@ rat@@ o &apos;s Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s Lady with an Er@@ mine from the 15th century .
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the bel@@ ie@@ vers would enter a sort of religious state of mind . Da Vinci &apos;s painting was selected because of its similar style and cal@@ ming nature .
The volunte@@ ers spent half an hour in an M@@ RI scanner and received 20 electric sho@@ cks within four consec@@ utive time periods , while they were looking at one of the abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned paintings .
The Catho@@ lic@@ s described the situation as &quot; safe &quot; and &quot; protecting &quot; which made them &quot; relaxed and peaceful &quot; .
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - compar@@ ing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo &apos;s work .
According to psych@@ ologist Miguel F@@ ari@@ as , taking part in the experiment himself , similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having strong emotional influence on the certain person , even among ath@@ ei@@ sts . It is all about finding the right picture .
&quot; We should find a photo of someone who they feel very positive about , like a mother or a father &quot; , says the psych@@ ologist .
Ang@@ lic@@ an bish@@ op Tom W@@ right welcomed the findings of the research .
&quot; Prac@@ ti@@ sing faith should change and often does change our personality &quot; , he added .
After these great results the question now is how Leonardo &apos;s or another highly appreciated pain@@ ter &apos;s picture of Mad@@ onna would influence the bel@@ ie@@ vers &apos; pain regulation ?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results ?
You are what you share
On its 10th birthday Google can admit : it is there in the people &apos;s po@@ cket , as well as above their head , in the sky . Google knows where people go on vacation , what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in .
In spite of all that , Eric Schmi@@ dt , a key person of the company is still not satisfied .
On the other hand , the scep@@ tics who bring it in parallel with Or@@ well &apos;s d@@ read@@ ful fantas@@ y just cannot see the essence of web 2.0 .
Eric Schmi@@ dt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users . It is necessary to maintain the Google fo@@ under@@ s &apos; original aim , namely : &quot; to create a system for all the information of the world &quot; , he added .
According to the Goo@@ g@@ le-@@ chief , the company - after having sub@@ ver@@ ted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the information .
Ans@@ wer@@ ing the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like &quot; What shall I do tomorrow ? &quot; , or &quot; What type of jobs suit me best ? &quot; . However , software cannot give the right answers to these seem@@ ingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient .
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that the terms search@@ ed by them are recorded , as well as the IP address used for the search and the pages visited by them afterwards .
Using the 2-@@ year-old Person@@ alized Search function , users can store their own surfing hi@@ stories , they can review what they were looking for , what kind of links they cli@@ cked on before . In the long term , it can provide the users with personalized findings . The function called Rec@@ omm@@ end@@ ations will be based on the same logic : it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier .
&quot; What happens if my personal data are used against me , if it is discovered what I do ? &quot; , ask some of the users worrying about the inform@@ ation-@@ monopoly of Google .
It is usually the degree of the potential power represented by the company that generates counter reaction in the users , not sense of gu@@ ilt , fear of punishment , desire for freedom or re@@ bel@@ lion against authority .
Nevertheless , it has been confirmed that all the search@@ ed terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to third parties . In such cases nothing protects the privacy of the Internet users .
The best example for that is the concer@@ ted action against some Brazilian pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les ; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages , called Or@@ k@@ ut . The data supplied helped the government identify several pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les .
The users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in May when Google - in association with the EE@@ F electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the F@@ B@@ I : the court confirmed that under no point of the Constitution can the F@@ B@@ I ob@@ lige Google to provide any kind of , sec@@ re@@ tly asked information .
( Nevertheless , - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 50 000 web addresses and 1 000 search terms . However , it could not acquire the individual users &apos; search lists , nor a complete list of web pages and key@@ words covering a two-@@ month period . )
As it seems , there are controversial opinions on Google . It is attacked by those who fear of giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be dimin@@ ished by using the services provided by Google . Thus , they rather represent the resist@@ ing group of conservative multinational companies .
Meanwhile , the American ge@@ ek culture and its wild o@@ at including enthusiastic computer fans , activists , users in several countries consider them as the next generation of large companies , a &quot; cool cor@@ poration &quot; , in contrast to their opinion about their ri@@ val , Microsoft , the cre@@ ator of Windows and the con@@ quer@@ or of the world , in spite of the fact that the two companies fight for the same goal .
One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications . Furthermore , the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - compar@@ ing to the official software giant &apos;s practice - looks more available , you@@ thful and cool .
Or maybe it is because of the fact that ge@@ eks can precisely see the problematic relation between personal privilege and Internet , which is in accordance with the most frequently discussed key expression of the last few years , web 2.0 .
Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to inten@@ tionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels . Though the degree of this act can be various , depending on the user , the main point is the same : we show ourselves to the world .
An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or X@@ ang@@ a , they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list maker last@@ .@@ f@@ m , then those can be connected to a tracking system such as Fri@@ end@@ F@@ eed or Bli@@ p.@@ f@@ m. In addition , users can create blo@@ gs that automatically update the recently up@@ loaded photo galleries stored on Fli@@ ck@@ r or Pic@@ asa .
We can read about several stories like this : the girl - checking the plenty of photos up@@ loaded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy boy@@ friend spent his previous night . Or another one : an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blog . One consequence can be definitely drawn : the definition of privacy has been re@@ valued .
If someone lives an online life , they are what they show of themselves - this is the basic concept behind the behaviour of today &apos;s youth .
If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to b@@ yp@@ ass Google &apos;s monopoly , it is also possible ( e.g. using S@@ cro@@ og@@ le , which also applies the Google search system but pur@@ pos@@ ely leaves no trace behind ) .
The number of those inten@@ tionally not regi@@ stering to social networking sites is significant . This way they can avoid being discovered , Google &apos;s online applications from text editor to image manager and news@@ reader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever .
General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google .
The company - with its value of USD 15@@ 6 billion - is worth more than IBM ( USD 140 billion ) , Intel ( USD 12@@ 4 billion ) or Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a ( USD 110 billion ) . In addition , the advertising spaces of Ad@@ Wor@@ ds / Ad@@ S@@ ense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-@@ increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious head@@ ache .
Nevertheless , critics can also find the distur@@ bing counter@@ points : the management completely rejected the employees &apos; obj@@ ection , which bur@@ st out because the fee of the company &apos;s k@@ inder@@ garten had been doub@@ led . The daily cant@@ een - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management . However , all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google b@@ owed before the Chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has fil@@ tered all search results that off@@ end good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime .
One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be adverti@@ sed in advance , only when they are ready to be used . Still , the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world : some people predic@@ t that the book and magazine sc@@ anning and archi@@ ving project of Google will soon reach such propor@@ tions that it will have to face the Supreme Court . Others have fear of the Health system , which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us , including our previous medical findings , physi@@ cians and problems .
Finally , the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci@@ -@@ fi writers of the next generation . C@@ ory Doc@@ tor@@ ow &apos;s popular novel , S@@ cro@@ og@@ led applies Or@@ well &apos;s style in the description of a future where a person can be pic@@ tured ter@@ rif@@ y@@ ingly well only by using Google data .
The mur@@ derer of two was assisted by two min@@ ors in hi@@ ding the traces in Ó@@ z@@ d
&quot; The police inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated two min@@ ors about the double hom@@ ici@@ de committed in Ó@@ z@@ d . There are reasonable grounds for susp@@ ecting that they assisted the mur@@ derer in hi@@ ding the traces of the crime &quot; , says the spo@@ kes@@ man of the main police station of Bor@@ so@@ d County .
The two young people admitted having committed the mentioned act , they are currently accused of ai@@ ding and ab@@ et@@ ting .
The two min@@ ors - 2 girls , according to the information provided by MT@@ I - answer to the charges at large .
Ai@@ ding and ab@@ et@@ ting can be punished by a maximum of 5 years of impris@@ onment .
The suspect of the double hom@@ ici@@ de committed in Ó@@ z@@ d - a 23@@ -@@ year-old local man - was taken to preliminary cust@@ ody on Sunday .
He is accused of having committed pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated hom@@ ici@@ de against several people , for the sake of gain .
During the investigation , it turned out that the 23@@ -@@ year-old young man owed significant amount of money to a 5@@ 3-@@ year-old man .
The suspect did not intend to pay back the debt , so he drew his credi@@ tor to a sub@@ urban establishment of Ó@@ z@@ d last Wednesday , where he killed him and his 9-@@ year-old daughter .
According to the information of MT@@ I , the young man was determined to commit the crime , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the fact that he had previously hidden a gun at the premis@@ e for this purpose .
The police is examining the gun and the conditions of the crime with the assistance of experts .
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted a bid to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million - approximately 5 billion Czech kor@@ unas - for the 100 % ownership of the Prague shares .
Lud@@ wi@@ k Sob@@ ol@@ ew@@ ski , President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the bid that has been taken by the Polish , in spite of the fact that the Czech had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the group of potential owners of the Prague shares .
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-@@ owned .
99 percent of the st@@ akes are in the ownership of the Polish government , which plans to sell 60 percent of the papers during the next few months .
According to E@@ 15 , the Czech economic daily newspaper , the Polish have submitted the best bid for the Prague shares .
On the basis of the information provided by the Czech newspapers , offers have been received from the transatlantic exchange Nas@@ da@@ q , the New York Stock Exchange , the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse .
Pet@@ r K@@ ob@@ lic , director of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that - among those being interested in the Prague shares - the worst option was the Warsaw Stock Exchange , the selection of which would result the c@@ ess@@ ation of the Prague bour@@ se .
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange st@@ akes is estimated 5 to 10 billion kor@@ unas by the market experts .
On the basis of the agreement among the shareholders , 90 percent of the st@@ akes could be purchased .
The largest amount of shares is in the hand of the owner of the Patri@@ a Finance investment bank , having approximately 25 percent of the st@@ akes . It is followed by the C@@ esk@@ á Spor@@ it@@ el@@ na bank with 14.@@ 7 percent and T@@ iger Holding Four S. a.@@ r.@@ l. with 13.@@ 5 percent .
About the financial crisis from the view of European newspapers
The leading European newspapers were descri@@ bing the ever-@@ deep@@ ening international financial crisis as &quot; a second September 11th &quot; in their Tuesday comments .
The global financial catastro@@ phe is due to the American president - says the Rom@@ e-@@ based La Repub@@ b@@ lica bl@@ am@@ ingly - the president was not even able to have his own party back up the has@@ ti@@ ly prepared bill which is supposed to find the way out of the de@@ pressing situation ...
It is not so much a new Pear@@ l Har@@ bor , as War@@ ren Buff@@ ett billi@@ on@@ aire investor described it , but rather a second September 11th .
Some of the Madrid press also blame Washington for the situation .
In the view of El M@@ und@@ o , the collapse of the world economy is due to the lack of political leadership in the U.S.
The American financial system is at a growing risk of collapse , which will make the whole world suffer .
Although Bush &apos;s plan was not perfect , now - pursuant to the con@@ gres@@ sional vote - the threatening risk is if Washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis .
World economy is hang@@ ing in the air - just at the time when one of the biggest transformation of capitalism is taking place .
&quot; The threat cannot be ignored any more &quot; , marks the Tages@@ -@@ Anzei@@ ger from Geneva .
Some countries are still able to provide a life-@@ belt for the weak@@ ened financial institutions and can save those from bank@@ rupt@@ cy by the money of the taxpayers .
However , if further banks collapse , as in a domin@@ o-@@ effect , neither the funds nor new impro@@ vis@@ ations will help .
What we need in the long term is that the members of the European Union shall determine themselves to overcome their own national sel@@ fish@@ ness and centr@@ alize the control over the divided financial markets .
&quot; The aid distributed just on Monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros &quot; , rec@@ alls the Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based Der Standard , adding that the wor@@ ries are getting to point out that , just like the Americans , the European taxpayers will also have to dig down into their po@@ ckets in order to remedy the situation .
The EU has not paid special attention to the crisis so far , which is now swe@@ eping through the old continent as a ts@@ un@@ ami .
It is not expected from the &quot; sa@@ vers &quot; to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the beginning but it would be important to determine the situations when the taxpayers &apos; money is necessary to be used in order to prevent a more serious damage .
Intelli@@ gent car im@@ it@@ ates the flying of a b@@ umb@@ le@@ be@@ e
What could be a better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than to m@@ im@@ ic nature &apos;s obstacle det@@ ectors ?
Let &apos;s examine be@@ es , for instance !
In a surprising project that is in progress at CE@@ AT@@ EC in Japan , the b@@ umb@@ le@@ be@@ e has given engineers at N@@ iss@@ an a strategic hin@@ t at how to design the next generation of cr@@ ash@@ -@@ avo@@ idance systems .
Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo , N@@ iss@@ an has built the BR@@ 23@@ C-@@ type Biom@@ im@@ atic Car Rob@@ ot Drive . It is a ro@@ bo@@ tic micro-@@ car that recre@@ ates be@@ e characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents col@@ li@@ sions altogether .
&quot; In flight , each be@@ e creates its own ov@@ al-@@ shaped personal space , which in fact closely res@@ emb@@ les our safety shi@@ eld &quot; , said Ka@@ zu@@ h@@ hi@@ ro Do@@ i brand director of technology , PR , research and development .
The compo@@ und structure of be@@ es &apos; eye plays a significant role , which makes the be@@ es able to see in all directions , at an angle of 300 degrees .
In order to recre@@ ate the function of a compo@@ und eye , the engineers came up with the idea of a laser range fin@@ der .
This device det@@ ects obstacles up to two meters away within a 18@@ 0-@@ degree radi@@ us in front of the BR@@ 23@@ C , calcul@@ ates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-@@ board micro@@ processor , which is instantly translated into col@@ li@@ sion avo@@ idance .
It takes just a fra@@ ction of a second to detect an obstacle , and the car ro@@ bot instantly changes direction m@@ im@@ icking the movements of a be@@ e by turning its wheels at the angle needed to avoid a col@@ li@@ sion .
One of the main differences from any current system is that the avo@@ idance manoeu@@ vre is totally inst@@ inc@@ tive .
&quot; If that was not so , then the car ro@@ bot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles , &quot; says To@@ shi@@ y@@ u@@ ki And@@ oh , manager of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s Mo@@ bility Labor@@ atory and principal engineer of the ro@@ bot car project .
It must react inst@@ inc@@ tively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner@@ -@@ most layer of the safety shi@@ eld , a layer in which a crash is currently considered un@@ avo@@ idable .
The whole process must mirror what a be@@ e does to avoid other be@@ es .
It must happen within the b@@ link of an eye .
But unlike a be@@ e , it cannot devi@@ ate up@@ wards or down@@ wards or di@@ agon@@ ally , only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the wheels can turn .
So in place of the infin@@ ite number of ways a b@@ umb@@ le@@ be@@ e can avoid other be@@ es , here only the ro@@ tation function , the acceler@@ ation and the dec@@ eler@@ ation have been applied as available means of col@@ li@@ sion avo@@ idance .
BR@@ 23@@ C uses li@@ thi@@ um-@@ poly@@ mer accum@@ ul@@ ators that are ligh@@ ter and have a higher energy density , which - compared to the li@@ thi@@ um-@@ ion version - ass@@ ures longer lifetime .
According to And@@ oh , what is important is the intelligent inst@@ inc@@ tive reaction , not the capability for data processing and storage .
The device is supposed to process only a few in@@ puts per second and react on them accordingly .
There is no need for stor@@ ing the in@@ puts and re@@ acting by the intuitive logic based on the previous manoeu@@ v@@ ring data , so it al@@ loc@@ ates continuously only a few do@@ zen ki@@ lob@@ y@@ tes of memory .
There is no need for gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te or meg@@ ab@@ y@@ te size memory .
This is the first step of developing the instant col@@ li@@ sion avo@@ idance technology that , on the basis of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s estimate , can be built into the seri@@ es-@@ produced cars within 10 years .
If connecting the device to the GPS satellite navigation system , an additional application option can be worked out which can help to avoid road barriers while driving .
A name granted to the expensive child
The written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic b@@ ail@@ out package has been drawn up . The draft law , applicable in several inst@@ al@@ ments , aims to purchase bad banking loans .
In the first round , half of the amount is planned to be spent .
&quot; During the further re@@ conci@@ li@@ ations having come to an end on Saturday night , East Coast time , the con@@ gres@@ sional leaders managed to agree on the debate of several days , which concerned the 700 billion dollar b@@ ail@@ out package &quot; , the R@@ eu@@ ters confirmed .
&quot; We have taken an important step forward &quot; , declared N@@ ancy Pel@@ o@@ si , democratic chair@@ woman of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , adding that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement .
The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates , Barack Obama and John Mc@@ C@@ ain as well .
Ref@@ err@@ ing to the results of the compromise , Henry Pau@@ l@@ son , Secretary of the Treas@@ ury declared : the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient , but further steps are still to be taken . According to Pel@@ o@@ si , it is not about rescu@@ ing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy .
The written form of the package has been published at 8 pm on Sunday , Washington time , at the opening time of the Asian markets ( at 2 am in Centr@@ al-@@ Europe ) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market .
The draft legislation of the Emer@@ gency Economic Stabili@@ zation Act of 2008 will be put to the vote on Monday , first in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , secondly in the Sen@@ ate .
President George W. Bush talked to Pel@@ o@@ si on Saturday night , then the news on the agreement was welcomed in the White House as well .
&quot; We are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabili@@ ze our financial markets and protect our economy &quot; , declared Tony Fr@@ at@@ to , spo@@ kes@@ man of the White House .
The programme diff@@ ers from the proposal having been first submitted by the Bus@@ h-@@ administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities .
Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday . One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities . An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used .
The programme will be super@@ vised by a separate body with the involvement of the chairman of the Federal Reserve .
On how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress .
Pur@@ su@@ ant to the law , the Secretary of the Treas@@ ury is entitled to apply a combined tac@@ tic : it can buy bad loans , mort@@ g@@ ages , mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities and other types of &quot; po@@ ison@@ ous &quot; credits .
The purchase can be realized on auc@@ tions or in a direct way , according to the Treas@@ ury .
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the wor@@ ris@@ ome assets will be guaranteed by the Treas@@ ury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages .
Henry Pau@@ l@@ son declared : pursuant to the law , the required assets are provided depending on the situation ; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system , due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets , or the insurance of those , or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes .
&quot; We will make the necessary arrangements in order to be ready for the implementation of the law , as soon as it has been signed &quot; , he added .
The directors of the troub@@ led banks waiting for state aid should count on that their sever@@ ance - which is simply called golden par@@ ach@@ ute in the overseas s@@ lang - will be restricted by the government .
The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only , limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treas@@ ury .
Rest@@ ri@@ ction means that in case the Treas@@ ury purchases on auction , sur@@ tax is imposed on the golden par@@ ach@@ ute , unless the ru@@ ined bank director is sent to retirement .
In the course of buying bad loans directly , the government will aggres@@ sively intervene in order to ensure that the amounts of man@@ ag@@ erial money are not exagger@@ ated .
It must be added that the existing golden par@@ ach@@ ute contracts will not be amended , restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme .
&quot; This is the first time in American history that legal restriction will be imposed regarding the remuner@@ ation of chief executive officers &quot; , comm@@ ented House Financial Service Committee Chairman Bar@@ ney Frank , of the Democratic Party .
Besides , the government will be confer@@ red with the right of holding acquisition , this way taxpayers &apos; risk will reduce , since they might even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescu@@ ed bank is recover@@ ed .
The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years , which speci@@ fies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector .
Sc@@ ep@@ tics gave voice for their doubts regarding the plan on both sides , too .
&quot; This is not what American citizens expect from us , this will not protect taxpayers &apos; dollars &quot; , stated Republic@@ an Representative Dar@@ rel@@ l I@@ ssa from California .
His Democratic colleague , Mary Kap@@ tur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street .
Industrial prices keep growing
&quot; Industrial domestic sales prices of August 2008 rose by 0.@@ 1 percent as compared to the previous month , and by 12.@@ 9 percent in comparison with the figures of August 2007 &quot; , K@@ S@@ H inform@@ s .
In relation to the data of July 2008 , industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher . When compared to the same period of the previous year , however , the prices decre@@ ased by 3.@@ 9 percent .
As a result of the domestic and export price changes , industrial producer prices went up by 0.@@ 7 percent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 percent in relation to the figures recorded one year earlier .
Industrial domestic sales prices showed a growth of only 0.@@ 1 percent compared to the previous month .
Dom@@ estic sales prices of the manufacturing industry increased only by 0.@@ 1 percent as well , in comparison to the figures of July .
In August 2008 the biggest price increase was experienced in leather , foot@@ wear manufacturing industry ( 2.@@ 8 percent ) , due especially to the 4.@@ 6 percent price increase in bag and stra@@ p production as well as the 2.5 percent monthly price increase in foot@@ wear production .

Both Barack Obama and Mc@@ C@@ ain support the bank rescue package
Both Barack Obama and John Mc@@ C@@ ain , presidential candidates of the two main American parties , confirmed on Sunday to back the government &apos;s 700 billion dollar bank rescue package , though there are politicians calling for the treas@@ ury secret@@ ary to res@@ ign .
After several days of mar@@ athon negotiations , the con@@ gres@@ sional and government representatives announced at Sunday da@@ wn : they have reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package .
Wall Street crisis and the financial package aiming to render the frozen credit market have become central issues of the presidential campaign .
Both Obama and Mc@@ C@@ ain seem to act in a way to prove : he is more suitable than his competi@@ tor to lead the country out of the economic crisis .
According to the latest surve@@ ys , due to the economic issues which have come into the for@@ eg@@ round , Obama has gained some advantage again , while Mc@@ C@@ ain &apos;s leading position - that he had acquired after the Republic@@ an convention , by having appointed Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in as vic@@ e-@@ president - has now mel@@ ted .
Obama expressed his hope at a campaign gathering in Det@@ ro@@ it regarding the fast con@@ gres@@ sional approval of the act on the 700 billion dollar package .
He empha@@ sized that the proposal included those consumer protection pass@@ ages that he had supported , too .
&quot; We must act now , with responsibility ( ... ) people &apos;s jobs , their savings , entire industries , the stabili@@ zation of the whole economy are the things that are threatened &quot; , he added in front of a crowd of 35 000 people .
He did not miss the chance to describe Mc@@ C@@ ain &apos;s economic concepts as out@@ dated .
Mc@@ C@@ ain stated in his report given to AB@@ C that &quot; this is a situation that will take long for all of us to di@@ gest ( ... ) but doing nothing is just cannot be affor@@ ded &quot; .
The Republic@@ an sen@@ ator declared that the proposal included the need to set up a committee super@@ vising the treas@@ ury secret@@ ary and to restrict the sever@@ ance of top leaders , it was him who had insi@@ sted on these issues .
Obama said to C@@ BS that Mc@@ C@@ ain had played no essential role in the re@@ conci@@ li@@ ations , while he had been in daily contact with the secret@@ ary .

News From The German Pap@@ ers
The right wing is un@@ touched , only the voters of the group have become more self-@@ conscious - Der Spiegel analyses the weak presence of CS@@ U in Bavaria .
Hai@@ der and his party are ready to go@@ vern Austria in order to avoid re@@ d-@@ black coalition .
Der Spiegel ( spi@@ egel@@ .de )
Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CS@@ U &apos;s dramatic defeat in his article The Bavarian revolution is eating up its parents , released in the Internet publication of the left wing news magazine .
According to the popular political scienti@@ st , the ero@@ sion of CS@@ U had began far before the sad B@@ eck@@ stein@@ -@@ Hu@@ ber du@@ o took over the office .
Christian soci@@ alists were doing reforms in Bavaria for long decades - at the present these modern citizens are the ones who turn away .
The beginning of a new era means a problem for all Christian democracy , including Angela Merkel as well .
The defeat did not really surprise CS@@ U but a whole process ended on Sunday , a process that had been likely to happen in the last 10 years : the c@@ ess@@ ation of the indisp@@ utable he@@ gem@@ ony of a state party .
Ten years ago , in 1998 CS@@ U land@@ ed on 4@@ 7.@@ 7 percent , the first time under 50 percent since the fif@@ ties .
It happened again 3 years ago , during the Bund@@ est@@ ag election 2005 , namely in the of@@ t-@@ mentioned Sto@@ i@@ ber era .
The reason for it was the consistent moderni@@ zation carried out by CS@@ U in the province , which e@@ ats up its parents .
Soci@@ ologists have predic@@ ted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong . Nevertheless , sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ zation , educational results , the sett@@ ling of Germans from the Eastern and Northern part of the country to the developing regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the CS@@ U loy@@ alty of the voters .
Modernis@@ ation comes together with the growth of opportunities and it has its own political consequences .
The right wing is un@@ touched , only the voters of the group have become more self-@@ conscious , critical and wil@@ ful .
What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks , mainly classical civil groups were depar@@ ting from CS@@ U ; people of the liberal profes@@ sions , industrial workers , people with secondary school certificate , people with college or university degree .
CS@@ U support here has been dimin@@ ished to below 40 percent .
Die Presse ( di@@ ep@@ res@@ se@@ .com )
&quot; Who , with whom ? Party chair@@ men are reserved considering coalition issues &quot; is the title of the article in which the Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based conservative daily newspaper is analy@@ zing the conf@@ using domestic political situation developed after the Austrian elections .
SP@@ Ö intends to negotiate with Ö@@ VP .
Ö@@ VP prohi@@ bits SP@@ Ö to intervene to its internal issues .
B@@ Z@@ Ö seems open to negotiate in all directions , the gre@@ ens do not wish to re@@ conci@@ le on coalition yet .
The election has already taken place , now everything is about the coalition ; during the debate organized by the public television , there was hardly any chance to gain insight into the party leaders &apos; cards .
SP@@ Ö Chairman Werner F@@ ay@@ mann confirmed his willingness to negotiate with Ö@@ VP .
SP@@ Ö would like to show that the cooperation of the two parties is possible - it does exist in some of the provin@@ ces as well as in social partnership .
F@@ ay@@ mann left the question of a coalition with Wilhelm Mol@@ ter as vic@@ e-@@ chan@@ cell@@ or - currently Ö@@ VP chairman - open .
As he said , the Sch@@ üssel@@ -@@ Mol@@ terer course has been rejected .
Tur@@ ning towards this direction again is out of question .
Mol@@ terer was cau@@ tious in handling red offers .
According to him , the cooperation by no means will be successful in case F@@ ay@@ mann tries to intervene to the internal issues of Ö@@ VP .
Whether choosing to remain opposition or entering a coalition is still an open question in the party , this issue has definitely to be discussed within Ö@@ VP .
B@@ Z@@ Ö Chairman J@@ ör@@ g Hai@@ der repeatedly seemed to be open to all alternatives .
&quot; In order to prevent a re@@ d-@@ black coalition , we are ready to undertake government responsibility &quot; , declared Hai@@ der .
J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka : The vi@@ cious circle of poverty , seg@@ reg@@ ation must be eliminated
The European E@@ quality Summit has been opened today in Paris , which is organized by France this year , representing the Presi@@ den@@ c@@ y-@@ in-@@ office of the European Union .
In her message that she addressed to the plen@@ um , L@@ í@@ via J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka of Fi@@ des@@ z , Representative of the European People &apos;s Party called attention for the educational seg@@ reg@@ ation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children . Moreover , this is the largest barrier to their prosperity .
The high level conference has been opened by X@@ avier Ber@@ tr@@ and , French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and V@@ ladimir Sp@@ id@@ la , European Commissioner responsible for Employment , Social Affairs and Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities .
Repres@@ ent@@ atives of the governments , the European social partners and the most significant European legal aid organizations and NGOs from the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference .
J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka - according to the press office of the Fi@@ des@@ z group in the EP - pointed out that , in addition to the discrimination experienced when applying for a job , Roma people are seg@@ reg@@ ated from the labour market mainly because of their low educational qualification .
&quot; Most of the young Roma people do not have a secondary school qualification , and due to the low quality of the basic education only an in@@ significant part of them can obtain college or university degree &quot; .
J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka also empha@@ sized that education , as a fundamental human right , plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights .
Invest@@ ing in the early education of Roma children can contribute to strengthening the economy of the European Union member states .
According to the representative , it is necessary to inform the wi@@ dest range of people - Roma and non-@@ Roma people as well - about these inter@@ relationships .
The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school , the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market ; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget .
&quot; On grounds of the citizenship right applied in the European Union , the right of quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality , seg@@ reg@@ ated education must be eliminated &quot; , added L@@ í@@ via J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka .
She also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school des@@ eg@@ reg@@ ation , it is necessary to guarantee an obj@@ ectiv@@ e- and ac@@ tion-@@ oriented cooperation within the European Union . To accomp@@ lish this goal , it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti-@@ discrimination directives .
&quot; The vi@@ cious circle of poverty , seg@@ reg@@ ation , unemployment must be eliminated , Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights &quot; , demanded J@@ á@@ r@@ ó@@ ka .
Within the framework of the &quot; European Year of Equ@@ al Opport@@ unities &quot; , the European E@@ quality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti-@@ discrimination at European and member state level as well .
CS@@ U : Tran@@ si@@ tion Gra@@ ce Peri@@ od
Decision About Def@@ e@@ ated Hu@@ ber@@ -B@@ eck@@ stein Du@@ o At The End Of October
Despite ign@@ om@@ ini@@ ous election failure heads have not rolled yet , personal issues are ad@@ jour@@ ned temporarily at the Bavarian CS@@ U summ@@ its .
President of the Party , Er@@ win Hu@@ ber and State Prime Minister , Gün@@ ther B@@ eck@@ stein may still keep their positions , the question is how long grace takes .
The dest@@ iny of the tan@@ dem which have suffered a catastro@@ phi@@ c 17 percent vote loss will be decided by the extraordinary party congress at the last weekend of October .
However , members of the much critici@@ zed du@@ o pic@@ tured : they do not insist on their seats by all means .
With this they intended to appe@@ ase the fur@@ ious members of the fra@@ ction and the basis who were claiming personal consequence because of having lost clear majority one day after the &quot; Bavarian ts@@ un@@ ami &quot; .
Five years ago the Christian Social Union - true , lead by Ed@@ mund Sto@@ i@@ ber who had been at the top of his career at that time - had obtained 6@@ 0.@@ 7 percent but now , one year after the coup against Sto@@ i@@ ber , the party could reach 4@@ 3.@@ 4 percent only .
CS@@ U had been &quot; absolute rul@@ er &quot; in Bavaria presenting 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years .
Although conserv@@ atives are still considered the most important party in the Southern province , which has key role for the Hungarian economy , they are definitely forced to form a coalition in the future .
As one of the first signs of restructuring within the party , Hu@@ ber &apos;s potential successor , Party Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Hor@@ st Seeh@@ of@@ er becomes member of the small expl@@ or@@ atory team beginning investig@@ ative negotiations about a possible M@@ uni@@ ch-@@ based government coalition with liberal F@@ DP as well as with Free Vo@@ ters representing right-@@ wing values .
Iron@@ y of fate is that Gabri@@ ele Pau@@ li , whose intervention against Sto@@ i@@ ber had been mis@@ used as a coup opportunity and later was handled roughly by the Hu@@ ber@@ -B@@ eck@@ stein du@@ o , becomes member of the legislative assembly from the party list of Free Vo@@ ters .
Le@@ aders of CS@@ U are making efforts on stabili@@ zing B@@ eck@@ stein in any way .
Sto@@ i@@ ber , who was staying in the background until now , will have an active role in the transition time , the ex-@@ state prime minister and former CS@@ U president claimed 28@@ th September the dark@@ est day of his political career .
Hu@@ ber made some bitter comments on CD@@ U on Monday , according to him CS@@ U would have deser@@ ved much more support from its fr@@ at@@ ernal party .
Other CS@@ U politicians think that the defeat is a warning to both CD@@ U and Angela Merkel .
After the Bund@@ est@@ ag El@@ ection due in September 2009 , Merkel cannot be chan@@ cell@@ or , unless CS@@ U , which was playing significant role in the 2005 national success , is rehabilit@@ ated through mutual efforts .
According to the disappointed Merkel , the failure of CS@@ U will not have a negative impact on the coalition government in Berlin .
Although it is relative : the wo@@ unded CS@@ U is not going to be easier to handle and the crisis of the social democ@@ rats is going to continue .
SP@@ D has achieved its weak@@ est result with 18.@@ 6 percent in Bavaria since 194@@ 6 .
Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ en@@ ko@@ -@@ Opposition : 1@@ 10-@@ 0
No opposition representative was elected to the Belar@@ u@@ sian parliament during the Sunday &apos;s election .
According to Russian observers , the reasons for this are the welfare and stability in the country led by Alexander Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko , while Organization for Security and Co-@@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) explains it as vote counting frau@@ ds .
OSCE deleg@@ ating 450 observers from 43 countries ref@@ uses to recognize the election .
Although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade , before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of United Democratic For@@ ces ( U@@ DF ) had seriously expected that Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko , who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2006 after the amendments of the constitution , was going to &quot; allow &quot; presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time .
Based on this , U@@ DF des@@ ist@@ ed from the formerly considered boy@@ cot@@ t , too .
The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the economically increasingly Russi@@ a-@@ dependent Belarus - that had raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Bel@@ trans@@ gas own@@ ing gas pi@@ pel@@ ines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wished to improve its relations with the EU , where visa is not granted for Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko and for a number of top politicians due to the Belar@@ u@@ sian political system , which is considered anti-@@ democratic .
The fact that OSCE when having evaluated the election campaign rather focused on positive changes instead of defic@@ ien@@ cies - like bann@@ ing one third of the opposition candidates from taking part in the elections - indicated dé@@ ten@@ te formerly .
However , O@@ ES@@ C &apos;s Monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the counting of votes .
According to the opposition , improvement is still perc@@ ep@@ tible in the political system : political prisoners have been dischar@@ ged and M@@ ins@@ k is inc@@ lined to confront with Moscow in a minor way by still not recogni@@ zing South Os@@ se@@ tia and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia which have sec@@ eded from Georgia , although Russia - forming a federal state with Belarus on paper - has already been considering the two territories independent for a month .
&quot; We have taken two steps ahead and one back@@ wards , but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started &quot; , told Alexander Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch to our paper .
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election of 2006 , this dialogue needs to be maintained in spite of the fact that the &quot; power has got afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight &quot; .
Se@@ eing the results , the opposition does not plan prot@@ esting actions , rather aims to reach voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms .
&quot; We have much trouble with this of course , we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia , distribution is hin@@ dered by the local authorities , but I can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people , amongst the old , too &quot; , said Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch referring to the fact that Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko &apos;s regime , which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result , is considered inappropriate even by pension@@ ers who are officially most supported class of society of all .
&quot; O@@ wing to the in@@ deb@@ t@@ edness of the country and the increase of trade deficit , the break@@ -@@ down of social security &apos; similar to dead silence &apos; is a question of time &quot; , Mil@@ in@@ ke@@ vi@@ ch claimed .
Russian observers described the elections as democratic , in contradiction to the opposition politi@@ cian .
Comm@@ on@@ wealth of Independent States mission leader S@@ erg@@ ei Le@@ be@@ dev told Russian news agency , Ri@@ a No@@ vo@@ sti : &quot; People believe in actions not words &quot; , so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of Belar@@ u@@ sian voters &apos; mat@@ urity .
Brun@@ etta : &quot; From now on breakfast before work &quot;
It has never happened in all the history of the Chi@@ gi Palace that there were revol@@ ving doors at the employee entrance and exit .
But as from today , a new measure starts against cra@@ f@@ ty ski@@ vers , against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours .
The novel anti-@@ sl@@ ack@@ ers measure has been presented today by the Public Administration Minister , Ren@@ ato Brun@@ etta , and by the Secretary General of the Office of the President of the Council , Maur@@ o Ma@@ si .
&quot; The revol@@ ving doors – says Brun@@ etta – are a tool for working better , with a higher productivity , higher presence and more services &quot; speci@@ fies the minister .
&quot; Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens .
This is reform@@ ism &quot; , under@@ lines again Brun@@ etta .
With the Chi@@ gi Palace , the installation in all the buildings of the Office of the President of the Council is complete .
For Ma@@ si &quot; the choice of revol@@ ving doors is also important from a symbolic view@@ point &quot; .
There has been no opposition from the employees , ass@@ ures the Secretary General : &quot; It has been a process shared by the workers and everybody collabor@@ ated &quot; .
To conclude , no more breakfast during working hours ; no more coffee and cro@@ iss@@ ant .
A word from Brun@@ etta , who suggests , sm@@ iling , &quot; a good c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ ino at seven is bl@@ essed &quot; .
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
of Rome , the minister , afterwards , makes known that &quot; in three months the ab@@ sen@@ ces , by public employees , due to si@@ ck@@ ness have reduced by 50 % , that is 60 thousand more people at work in a year &quot; .
And adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient .
Itali@@ ans , &quot; whose wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8 – 10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate &quot; .
Mean@@ time thousands of public employees have united to challenge the provisions set by the Brun@@ etta decre@@ e adher@@ ing to the petition supported by Co@@ d@@ ac@@ ons .
&quot; While the minister for Civil Service today par@@ ades the figures regarding the reduced ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm at work due to si@@ ck@@ ness – the consumers &apos; association writes – the population of ‘ the industri@@ ous ski@@ vers &apos; is continuously increasing .
In fact , in Italy there are thousands of honest and productive public administration employees that have united to declare war on the il@@ legitimate provisions within the decre@@ e &quot; .
In particular , at the T@@ AR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for in@@ fir@@ m@@ ity incurred during work will be cont@@ ested ; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for control medical visits , and other aspects within the new provisions insi@@ sted on by the minister .
Ac@@ ci@@ dents at work , Na@@ polit@@ ano : &quot; Pre@@ vention is crucial &quot;
Every@@ day , in Italy , at work 2@@ 500 accidents occur , 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently invali@@ d .
For 2007 , IN@@ A@@ IL data confirm that in fact work related deaths have been around 1200 .
Fig@@ ures that witness the gra@@ vity of a phenomenon that remains one of the principal causes of death and causes almost double the deaths with respect to hom@@ ici@@ de .
To recall the attention of institutions , social forces and information media to this dramatic issue , today An@@ mi@@ l is celebr@@ ating in all the Italian provin@@ ces the 5@@ 8th National Day for Cas@@ u@@ alties of Ac@@ ci@@ dents at Work , institution@@ alised onto the second Sunday of October .
&quot; The worrying data diff@@ used by An@@ mi@@ l and the very same tragic current news confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is &quot; , declar@@ es the President of the Republic Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ polit@@ ano , in his message to the president of An@@ mi@@ l , National Association of the Mu@@ til@@ ated and Inv@@ ali@@ ds at Work , Piet@@ ro Merc@@ and@@ elli .
The head of the State expresses his &quot; deep appreciation of the constant associ@@ ative efforts for prevention at the workplace , car@@ ing for injured workers , assistance of the cas@@ u@@ alties &apos; families , and the sensi@@ tiz@@ ation of public opinion &quot; .
&quot; Naturally , an indi@@ gn@@ ant ‘ enough &apos; has been raised , sincerely shared in front of trage@@ dies that , due to their size , provo@@ ke an out@@ c@@ ry by the media and the involvement of public opinion but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases , whose dynamics are even re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; .
Na@@ polit@@ ano does not conc@@ eal that &quot; undoubtedly there &apos;s also a resources problem : it &apos;s important to invest in training and information .
A particular significance is assumed by the numerous initiatives promoted within the schools in raising awareness of the younger generation that face the work market .
It &apos;s a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon , not give up to its serious social alarm , apply and improve the legislative provisions .
On his part the president of the Chamber Gi@@ an@@ fran@@ co Fin@@ i has under@@ lined &quot; as the phenomenon of acci@@ dental deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency , that off@@ ends the conscience of each and every one of us and im@@ poses on all the institutions a decisive obligation towards urgently ending it &quot; .
&quot; Data regarding in@@ jur@@ ies at the workplace seem to signal a small positive trend , but this does not take away the fact that the number of acci@@ dental deaths is in any case impressive &quot; , re@@ marked the president of An@@ mi@@ l Piet@@ ro Merc@@ and@@ elli .
&quot; We do not want , in fact , that this ‘ down@@ turn trend &apos; is translated into a reduced al@@ er@@ tness , because it is just when the attention is reduced that tragedy explo@@ des .
&quot; We believe that at a general level little is being done to oppose the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight could be carried on through multiple actions .
It is necessary , in our opinion , - under@@ lined Merc@@ and@@ elli – to have more controls and inspections , but also a stronger intervention on the worker training , and this should start at school &quot; .
&quot; A greater effort is required – he added – with regards to the communication and sensi@@ tiz@@ ation of public opinion .
But , above all , a greater sense of responsibility is required on behalf of employers in respect of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency &quot; .
Merc@@ and@@ elli then den@@ ounced &quot; the progressive deterioration of the level of care benefit provided for cas@@ u@@ alties at work &quot; and the &quot; welfare dri@@ ft which the system is taking in the last few years &quot; .
&quot; Hence , the objective is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spont@@ aneous political actions or grants which are from time to time set out by legislat@@ ors &quot; .
M@@ p@@ 3 players under accus@@ ation , they put hearing at risk
List@@ ening to music at high volume for a pro@@ long@@ ed period of time using portable musical devices such as M@@ p@@ 3 players could cause permanent les@@ ions to hearing .
This is what a European Commission reports , which in a communication released in Brussels c@@ ites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emer@@ ging and New@@ ly Identi@@ fied Health Ris@@ ks ( SC@@ EN@@ I@@ HR ) of the EU , published today .
&quot; From this scientific advice – the note reads – emerg@@ es that 5@@ - 10 % of those that , for a period of at least 5 years , listen to music using portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability &quot; .
&quot; It wor@@ ries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cell@@ ular phones at very high volume may un@@ consci@@ ously damage their hearing in an irre@@ par@@ able way &quot; , declar@@ es Meg@@ len@@ a Kun@@ eva .
&quot; From the scientific findings – carries on the EU spo@@ kes@@ person – a clear risk emerg@@ es and we have to react rapidly .
What counts most , we need to sensi@@ ti@@ ze consumers and make this information available to the public .
Besides , in light of this scientific advice , we have to re-@@ examine exist@@ ent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology &quot; .
Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem , seeing the widespread use of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate .
&quot; Scienti@@ sts – concludes the EU executive – confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now examine , together with member states and other interested parties , what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment &quot; .
Currently , a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 d@@ B , but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources , are increasing .
It is possible to considerably limit the damage by res@@ or@@ ting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure .
In its opinion , the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical players listen to music at high volume ( &gt; 89 d@@ B ) for only 5 hours per week , they are already over the per@@ missible maximum noise limits currently in place for the workplace .
People who listen to music under such conditions for longer dur@@ ations risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period .
This is the case for 5-@@ 10 % of users of such devices and their number can be quanti@@ fied to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the EU .
Rome , Al@@ em@@ ann@@ o gives the go ahead to the Commission for the Future of the Capital
Today it starts , in March it concludes , in June the conclusions are drawn .
This is the schedule set by the Camp@@ i@@ do@@ gli@@ o for the &quot; Commission for the Future of the Capital &quot; , which has this morning taken up residence at its new premises behind the Car@@ ac@@ alla Hot Sp@@ rings .

&quot; The commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions , social , and cultural are represented – under@@ lines Al@@ em@@ ann@@ o – It should make proposals for a development plan of Rome on which the political exec@@ u@@ tives , which are always the Mun@@ icip@@ al Board and Council , can rely .
There is no super@@ position of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up .
In March its job will be done and it will dis@@ solve , because this experiment should have a precise deadline .
In June – the may@@ or announ@@ ces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital &quot; .
For those who acc@@ use the Commission of being us@@ eless , since its opinions will not be binding , Al@@ em@@ ann@@ o rep@@ lies : &quot; Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals .
If the quality is there , as in France with the Att@@ ali Commission and as I &apos;m sure there will be in Rome , then its contribution will be fundamental .
Too often politics are overwhel@@ med by everyday administration and by emer@@ gen@@ cies that mani@@ fest themselves from time to time .
On the contrary , we want to look further for@@ wards and further ahead , with a deeper perspective , working seriously on the development of Rome and its future .
Furthermore , the may@@ or of Rome would like to point out that &quot; this commission is neither a us@@ eless agency nor an un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy bureaucratic organisation : it &apos;s absolutely free , it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will serve to get reason@@ ing and get involved the best minds that the Capital has to offer &quot; .
For Al@@ em@@ ann@@ o , in fact , &quot; it &apos;s essential to have a strategic reference plan , not closed or inf@@ lexi@@ ble , to permit our city to do an authentic le@@ ap in quality , which it really needs , thinking with a united spirit of its future .
A future that , speci@@ fies the Mayor of Rome &quot; will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further af@@ ield &quot; not only with the view of a future metro@@ politan city and its legal status as Capital but &quot; also with consideration to the role that Rome could and must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean &quot; .
Obama ? The first anti-@@ American President . Here is why ?
A famous American politi@@ cian , who would like to pass off as independent , wrote : Barack Obama will be the second anti-@@ American president .
The first was Jim@@ my Car@@ ter , who with his decisions dec@@ im@@ ated the US economy and had deal@@ ings ( as he still does today as a private citizen ) with the enemy Islam &quot; .
Att@@ acks on Obama increase right as the election date ne@@ ars .
A lady from Mi@@ ami has written on the web : &quot; This person is full of ambitions .
Obama is being che@@ ek@@ y : he thinks he can win the highest position in a country which has had in total two govern@@ ors and five sen@@ ators that were black ! &quot; .
In reality , these are attacks that don &apos;t mean a lot : they are clearly ra@@ cial attacks and do not answer the elec@@ tors &apos; question : will he be a good president ? And then there are the poll@@ s ; all of them say that Obama will win and by a wide margin .
Even in this case there are those who speak from the heart and not from the head .
A Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i newspaper , deep in the South of the United States , wrote an edi@@ torial : once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to whom the American patri@@ ot will give his vote .
A side of the United States ment@@ ality that has been kept under w@@ rap@@ s to the last , emerg@@ es .
&quot; S@@ ay whatever you like , afterwards we &apos;ll take care of where to put the cross , for Obama or for Mc@@ C@@ ain &quot; .
There are people who swe@@ ar : if Obama wins , we will go away from America .
Th@@ ings that have never been said before now , when the success of the black candidate is almost certain .
However , in spite of all these arguments , the winning tru@@ mp for the Democrats is George Bush .
1500 people have been asked what have been the errors committed by Bush during his mandate ? 89 per cent have answered : Iraq .
America changes .
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs .
In Iraq 4@@ 500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack up and leave .
Yet , for the majority Iraq has been the weak point of Bush .
W@@ ho@@ ever takes up the place of George W. will have an enormous task to do .
USA , the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists : in the newspapers it is time for cuts . And many blame the internet , &quot; k@@ iller &quot; of the printed paper .
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by P@@ EW Research Centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the future .
Well , nowadays journalists are almost all of them p@@ essimis@@ tic regarding their future .
Yet , to the information c@@ ler@@ ks , they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility .
They don &apos;t feel as isolated as they used to .
The problem for American journalists is the money , the money .
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model .
Furthermore the cuts carried out in the news@@ room , the office where edi@@ tors work to ass@@ emble the newspaper , are a big problem .
It &apos;s a problem that needs to be resolved , according to the journalists inter@@ viewed , if we do not want that traditional journ@@ alism as it is understood by the general public is substantially dimin@@ ished .
A clear but complex p@@ essimis@@ m nowadays per@@ v@@ ades American journalists .
Six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior exec@@ u@@ tives are convinced that journ@@ alism at a national level is going down the wrong road .
Within the local field the executive group is 65 % .
Prin@@ ted against broadcast .
It &apos;s not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going .
The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet , by many seen as the &quot; assass@@ in &quot; of the printed paper .
The &quot; economic pressure &quot; that journalists have felt has increased up to 79 % .
The 500 journalists inter@@ viewed have admitted that they are embra@@ cing technology hoping that it &quot; will do some good &quot; for their journ@@ alism .
The biggest rift in American journ@@ alism nowadays is between those who manage the news@@ rooms – that is the directors – and the re@@ por@@ ters who work for them .
56 % of managers at national level are certain that their re@@ por@@ ters share their values , whilst at local level the percentage decre@@ ases to 23 % .
For some this has got to do with &quot; job security &quot; .
On a national level , 43 % of the managers believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years .
For journalists the figure is 30 % .
As for &quot; job security &quot; at staff level ( our edi@@ tors , n@@ d@@ r ) in America it varies on a day to day basis .
Only 13 % of journalists have a work contract .
In an immense nation such as the USA , with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journ@@ als , magazines , radio , TV , and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or leave it .
Directors almost always receive huge salaries , while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month , in addition to the pension and paid ins@@ ur@@ ances .
As for holiday , things get complicated : so many days the first year , so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years .
But American journalists , by their own admission , fall frequently &quot; ill &quot; during the year .
It &apos;s all a question of climate .
UN@@ IP@@ OL : RO@@ ME TR@@ IB@@ UN@@ AL , D@@ AN@@ ILO CO@@ PP@@ OL@@ A ST@@ A@@ Y@@ S AT G@@ RO@@ TT@@ AF@@ ER@@ R@@ ATA
The president of the second pen@@ al section of the Rome tri@@ bunal , Car@@ mel@@ o Rin@@ au@@ do , has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent , Dan@@ il@@ o C@@ opp@@ ola that had requested to be able to move from his home town , Gro@@ tt@@ af@@ err@@ ata , to an abo@@ de in Rome .
C@@ opp@@ ola is under investigation for bank@@ rupt@@ cy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter-@@ proposal regarding the Uni@@ pol@@ -B@@ n@@ l tak@@ eover .
While on trial , last week , he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to remain resident in Gro@@ tt@@ af@@ err@@ ata .
His lawyers , Mich@@ ele G@@ enti@@ lon@@ i and Ga@@ et@@ ano P@@ ec@@ or@@ ella , had asked that the estate agent could travel from the country town within the province to an abo@@ de within the capital .
According to the tri@@ bunal , however , these trips ( against which the PM has advised ) would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence that is used to charge him .
The elite in danger
The phenomenon had already manifest@@ ed itself a couple of days back with the vote in the Chamber of Repres@@ ent@@ atives against the rescue plan of 700 billion American dollars passed by the White House : a significant portion of Americans was , and still is , more interested in pun@@ ishing Wall Street than in saving the economy .
A confirmation was given by yesterday &apos;s New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republic@@ an Party , ever more divided between its old East Coast soul , moderate , in favour of federal institutions and the business community , and its new soul , instead conservative , hosti@@ le to &quot; those in Washington » and to the financial world , especially strong within the Central and Southern states .
The soul , to be exact , which has made itself over@@ bear@@ ingly alive with the vote mentioned initially .
The latter is but only one example of the changes , of the big changes , that the current economic earthquake perhaps her@@ al@@ ds or allows to be perceived : not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here .
Both in the USA as in Europe the crisis seems to act as a cat@@ aly@@ st for phenomena which have been in inc@@ ub@@ ation for some time and which in the new climate have solidi@@ fied and are finally coming to light .
The first of these phenomena is the bringing back up-to-date , the extraordinary re-@@ launch , of the twin category state-@@ sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-@@ nation@@ alisation of the economy .
The crisis , in fact , is a crisis for the finan@@ ci@@ al-@@ banking institutions who have , indeed , strong ties with foreign countries , but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation , in a single state .
This immediately creates a political problem for wh@@ o@@ ever is in government : and that is how to respond to the difficulties and the protests of those people and those families that , besides , also form the elec@@ torate .
In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem .
Political internation@@ alism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say : the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that , divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies , cannot decide on a common political path .
And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention , b@@ ail@@ out and re-@@ launching plans , new rules , and especially financial aid : since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources , the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things .
And they possess likewise the necessary means , and the legitimate reasons to use them : two resources of inc@@ omm@@ ens@@ ur@@ able value , under certain circumstances , of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dis@@ pose of in an an@@ alog@@ ous measure .
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the stat@@ al-@@ national element is after all perfectly tun@@ ed with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attri@@ bute to a co@@ efficient that is very closely connected to that element : territori@@ ality .
Par@@ ad@@ ox@@ ically , in fact , while we were convinced that we had entered the rei@@ gn of the web , of a technology increasingly more sophisticated , of the im@@ material , while we were convinced that glob@@ alised finance was by now dest@@ ined to domin@@ ate the world , we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little im@@ material such as water , harv@@ ests , oil .
Ac@@ ci@@ dentally , all are items that can certainly be transported from one place to another but in any case are tied in an absolute fashion to a well defined space , to a territory .
So that wh@@ o@@ ever finds himself to be the sovereign , surely holds more cards in his deck than he who isn &apos;t , than he who happens to live in a place without crops , oil , or water .
I &apos;m getting to the second no@@ vel@@ ty that however predic@@ ts a split .
W@@ ho@@ ever says Territ@@ ory , State , Government , inevitably implies Poli@@ tics , and hence Le@@ a@@ dership .
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two conver@@ gent phenomena .
On the one hand the knowledge of the objective need for authorit@@ ative leadership , the demand for somebody who knows how to handle the situation .
On the other hand a wave of dis@@ credit for exist@@ ent leadership , an economic sort , revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas .
And together something ever deeper and in a certain way distur@@ bing : a dis@@ credit , an intoler@@ ance , an image of in@@ adequ@@ acy , a sense of re@@ mot@@ eness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever-@@ increasing number of Western countries .
Rather , it appears to make its way further in vast sections of the population the conviction which before that their actions are the same ideas as of the social elite up till now in favour , their way of feeling and being , their culture in all accepted mean@@ ings of the word , to have had their day , and to always be more alien to the opinion of the majority .
In other words , the call for leadership feeds under@@ han@@ de@@ dly a bran@@ ched but powerful movement of deleg@@ itim@@ ization of the man@@ ag@@ erial class and of the traditional political structures , that mani@@ fest itself in the sudden electoral &quot; revol@@ ts » or ab@@ rupt twi@@ sts in the collective mo@@ o@@ ds in these last and latest times , from the conservative rise in Austria – Bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain , to the re@@ bel@@ lion of the American con@@ gres@@ s@@ men against Bush ( and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it ) .
One gets the impression that the traditional elite , their parties , their programmes , but also their rit@@ es , their newspapers , their acc@@ redi@@ ted intellec@@ tu@@ als , some would say their formats , are finding it always more difficult to compreh@@ end , and hence to represent , that which has been taking shape within the deep@@ est layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening , au@@ g@@ ment@@ ing , potentially ag@@ it@@ ating without restra@@ int .
In face of all this , talking about a &quot; re@@ bel@@ lion of the mass@@ es » as being the order of the day may be frank@@ ly exagger@@ ated .
But keeping one &apos;s eyes wide open , it is not for sure .
Super@@ glu@@ e to be able to walk on walls
To defeat the laws of gra@@ vity thanks to a super glu@@ e and in the future be able to walk up walls like Spi@@ der@@ man .
It &apos;s the aim of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close .
With an adhes@@ ive of only 2.5 cm squar@@ ed the scientists have succeeded in glu@@ ing a body of 100 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s onto a vertical wall .
Stu@@ dying – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Day@@ ton , Ak@@ ron , of the Georgia Institute of Technology , and of the Air Force Research Labor@@ atory .
The material invented by the team of scientists is an improvement on exist@@ ent materials that utili@@ se a particular carbon structure , called carbon nan@@ ot@@ ub@@ es .
« The principle behind the glu@@ e could be imag@@ ined as being like a series of tu@@ bes arranged like a pi@@ le of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ etti » explains Z@@ h@@ ong L@@ in W@@ ang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlan@@ ta .
The scientists were inspired by the pa@@ ws of ge@@ ck@@ oes , covered with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bri@@ st@@ les which succeed in ass@@ uring a perfect adhes@@ ion to the animal .
The tests conducted on various materials such as glass , T@@ ef@@ lon , and sand@@ paper have demonstrated that the new adhes@@ ive is ten times stronger than the pa@@ ws of this rep@@ tile and at the same time &quot; comes off from walls easier » explains Lim@@ ing Da@@ i , resear@@ cher at the Engineering Fac@@ ul@@ ty of the University of Day@@ ton .
W@@ AL@@ K ON W@@ ALL@@ S ? - &quot; This material could be useful as a temporary glu@@ e » adds Lim@@ ing Da@@ i .
Perhaps for walking on walls just like Spi@@ der@@ man ? Maybe yes , but the researchers are thinking of a less gl@@ amor@@ ous use such as the connections between electrical devices , because the carbon nan@@ ot@@ ub@@ es are conduc@@ tors of heat and of electrical current .
Other applications could be within the a@@ erospace industry .
For now , no super@@ her@@ oes .
O@@ TH@@ ER RES@@ E@@ AR@@ CH – Even Ber@@ kel@@ ey University , in California , is dedic@@ ating itself to the research of a new adhes@@ ive .
In an article in the journ@@ al of the American Chem@@ ical Society the Califor@@ ni@@ an scientists have presented an adhes@@ ive composed of micro@@ fi@@ bers like hair that self-@@ clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhes@@ ion .
Dru@@ gs : N@@ ever with fruit ju@@ ices .
Be careful of gra@@ p@@ ef@@ ru@@ it juice , orange juice , and app@@ le juice .
These drinks , especially consum@@ ed in summer because they are thir@@ st qu@@ en@@ ching and rich in vit@@ am@@ ins , if taken together with some li@@ fes@@ aving drugs may alter their absor@@ ption , ampli@@ fying or dimin@@ ishing , depending on the case , their efficiency with consequences that may also be serious for health .
Con@@ fir@@ ming the risks associated with the assumption of fruit ju@@ ices whether they are pre-@@ pack@@ aged or fresh with certain medicines is David Bai@@ ley , professor at the university of Western On@@ t@@ ario in London , who from the 23@@ 6th national meeting of the American Chem@@ ical Society under@@ way in Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a laun@@ ches a new warning : a glass of gra@@ p@@ ef@@ ru@@ it juice , orange juice , or app@@ le juice is enough to reduce the absor@@ ption of certain li@@ fes@@ aving drugs , n@@ ul@@ li@@ fying their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients .
G@@ rap@@ ef@@ ru@@ it juice has already been accused because it was thought to be responsible for raising , up to levels thought to be toxic , the effects of some anti@@ rhyth@@ mic , antibio@@ tic , tranqu@@ ili@@ sing , anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ ic , and neur@@ ological medicines .
DR@@ U@@ GS AT R@@ IS@@ K – The very same Italian Dru@@ g Agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago , al@@ er@@ ting doctors and patients to not under@@ estimate the dangers deri@@ ving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is dr@@ unk in cases when drugs are taken such as for example Di@@ az@@ ep@@ am or Me@@ th@@ ad@@ one .
NOT ON@@ L@@ Y G@@ RA@@ P@@ EF@@ R@@ U@@ IT J@@ U@@ ICE – According to experts even orange juice and app@@ le juice contain substances that in@@ hi@@ bit drugs .
The list of active principles in@@ hi@@ bited by gra@@ p@@ ef@@ ru@@ it and other fruit ju@@ ices is very long .
Hence the appeal of Mich@@ ele Car@@ ru@@ ba , director of the Department of P@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology of the State University of Milan : &quot; U@@ su@@ ally , such dis@@ cover@@ ies are immediately brought to the attention of the various international and national drug agencies that then change the information sli@@ ps of medicines .
Therefore , always read the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear , do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chem@@ ist for clari@@ fications » emphasised the expert from the An@@ sa Agency .
The Nobel Prize for Economy to Paul K@@ rug@@ man
The Nobel Prize for Economy goes to the American Paul K@@ rug@@ man for his studies on market models and on the loc@@ alisation of economic activities .
55 year old K@@ rug@@ man is a neo-@@ Keyn@@ es@@ ian that te@@ aches at Princ@@ et@@ on University and he is a well-known leader writer of the New York Times .
K@@ rug@@ man is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the Bush administration .
A few months after the attacks of September 2001 , in the days when En@@ ron was going bank@@ rupt , K@@ rug@@ man had forec@@ ast@@ ed in an edi@@ torial published on the New York Times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first , in terms of its consequences on the history of the United States .
A predic@@ tion that started a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the econom@@ ist &apos;s face , but has now been revealed to have been exact .
« I am surprised and also a bit anno@@ yed by the speed with which rec@@ oll@@ ections of sc@@ and@@ als such as the collapse of En@@ ron or World@@ com have disappeared from public attention » , declared K@@ rug@@ man towards the end of 2002 .
According to Lor@@ enzo B@@ ini S@@ mag@@ hi , of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank , K@@ rug@@ man is an &quot; econom@@ ist of great value » , but also an or@@ ator with a &quot; very aggressive style , particularly critical of the exc@@ esses in liber@@ alism of the Bush administration » .
Open Office , here is the third edition of the &quot; anti-@@ Microsoft » package .
Today sees the release of Open@@ offic@@ e.@@ org 3.0 , the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users , from domestic to home users , from professionals to public administration , as a free alternative for the better known Microsoft Office .
After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunte@@ er developers , with S@@ UN Micro@@ system super@@ vising at their backs , the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various no@@ vel@@ ties : to the welcome screen and to a re@@ visited , less S@@ part@@ an user interface , are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format O@@ DF ( Open Docum@@ ent Format ) 1.2 , the latest ISO version standard .
At@@ tention was also placed on interoper@@ ability with the Office 2007 suite , Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension ( .@@ doc@@ x , .@@ x@@ ls@@ x , .@@ pp@@ t@@ x ) .
Inter@@ esting are some functions specific to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of Power@@ Point presentations , useful for example for sending them via email , or the possibility of import@@ ing a PDF file into the graphics module , maintaining the original appearance of the page .
Al@@ ways on the same track , it is possible to create &quot; hybrid PDF &quot; documents , that join the standard graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spre@@ ad@@ sheet or a word processor .
Coll@@ abor@@ ation is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved : in the spre@@ ad@@ sheet application several users can operate simultaneously , avoiding conflicts on the modifications , in the word processor , each users is assigned a comm@@ enting colour to improve recognition during revision .
Some companies are also working on port@@ ing some of the func@@ tion@@ alities of Open@@ Office onto the Web ( on the cl@@ oud ) , and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product .
The Italian version is available for download at the address http : / / it@@ .@@ open@@ offic@@ e.@@ org / download / 3.@@ 0.@@ 0 / downlo@@ ad@@ 300@@ .@@ html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday .
Besides for Windows and Mac OS , as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system .
On request the installation c@@ d can be sent to your home or workplace .
And if the g@@ imm@@ ick of free could be a driving force for the diff@@ u@@ sion into houses , it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools .
And there are even institutions that offer training services , consultancy , and assistance , ideal small to medium enterprises , which could create more business opportunities .
Open Office is composed of five main modules : Writ@@ er , for on@@ screen typ@@ ing corresponding to Word ; Cal@@ c , the spre@@ ad@@ sheet application aiming at sub@@ stit@@ uting Excel ; Im@@ press , for presentations in em@@ ulation of Power@@ point ; D@@ base , as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that cons@@ ents working on databases ; Dra@@ w , is the graphic module .
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads , and considering that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand , with the release of the new version it is prob@@ able that the predic@@ ted figure could even be exceeded .
Even Koh@@ l tested positive , it is the fourth case of d@@ oping
A new case of positive testing during the last Tour de France : it is the Austrian Bern@@ hard Koh@@ l , of the team Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer , third in classification and winner of the best gri@@ m@@ pe@@ ur shirt .
Re@@ port@@ ing the news is the daily newspaper L &apos;@@ Equi@@ pe .
The 26 year old Koh@@ l is the fourth cy@@ cli@@ st tested positive to C@@ era , the third generation EP@@ O , after the Itali@@ ans Ric@@ car@@ do Ric@@ c@@ ò and Leonardo P@@ ie@@ poli , and the German Stefan Schu@@ macher , also from the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer team .
The analysis of the blood samples from Koh@@ l form part of those performed within the last few weeks by the labor@@ atories of Lo@@ s@@ anna and Ch@@ aten@@ ay-@@ Mal@@ ab@@ ry .
If the counter-@@ analysis confirm the tests as positive to C@@ era , the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and faces the two-@@ year can@@ on@@ ical dis@@ qualification .
Con@@ fir@@ ming the news of Koh@@ l testing positive to the third generation Ep@@ o is the French anti-@@ d@@ oping agency &apos;s chief , Pierre B@@ ord@@ ry who informed the Associ@@ ated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results .
The 26 year old Austrian had placed himself on the fin@@ alist po@@ dium behind the Spanish Carlos Sa@@ str@@ e and the American C@@ ad@@ el Evans , also winning the pol@@ ka-@@ dot@@ ted shirt of the best gri@@ m@@ pe@@ ur .
IMM@@ IG@@ R@@ ANT@@ S : NEW YORK IS W@@ ON@@ DER@@ ING , IS IT@@ AL@@ Y R@@ AC@@ IS@@ T ?
Italy &quot; from a country of emi@@ grants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants &quot; reluc@@ t@@ antly received .
Is this trans@@ forming the ‘ Bel@@ pa@@ ese &apos; into a nation of ra@@ ci@@ sts ? This is what is being ques@@ tioned in a long article in the New York Times , which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Ab@@ dul William Gui@@ bre originally from Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o killed last month in Milan for having st@@ olen a box of bis@@ cu@@ its .
This case proves what the New York Times calls the &quot; northern parad@@ ox &quot; : the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is &quot; most integration and most work &quot; but also where there is &quot; the highest anti-@@ im@@ migrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League &quot; .
As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Itali@@ ans and immigrants the N@@ Y@@ T has also c@@ ited the incidents of intoler@@ ance in Milan , Par@@ ma , Rome , Ci@@ amp@@ ino , and Cast@@ el Vol@@ tur@@ no .
Not only .
Even the new legislation from the League that tigh@@ tens the bra@@ kes on immigration and facilit@@ ates the exp@@ ul@@ sion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a para@@ dig@@ m of the change in climate in Italy .
A trend that has been highlighted by the P@@ ope as well as by the President of the Republic &quot; Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ polit@@ ano who meeting Ben@@ e@@ dict X@@ VI at the Qu@@ ir@@ inal has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism &quot; .
Stu@@ dents victims of high r@@ ents up to 900 Euro for a room
The rent market for university students does not know crises .
According to the latest investigation by S@@ UN@@ IA , the ten@@ ants &apos; syn@@ dic@@ ate , r@@ enting a single room could cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan , 700 in Florence , 650 in Naples , 600 in Rome .
&quot; The phenomenon has now assumed a very serious trend ; up to the point that entire bands of young people are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living which their families would have to sustain – explains the executive from the Research Office of S@@ UN@@ IA , La@@ ura Mari@@ ani – in these cities the strong demand by the students has distor@@ ted the market so much as to start a process of general increase in rent even for residents &quot; .
In the majority of cases the r@@ ent-@@ offers contain a series of violations : fre@@ est@@ yle contracts , un@@ registered , without rent limits , connected sub@@ le@@ ases .
According to S@@ UN@@ IA special intervention is necessary that , through a revision of the taxes imposed , the prices could be cool@@ ed down .
Looking at the details of the investigation , one can see that in Milan , for a bed@@ -@@ space in the Bri@@ anza zone , 450 Euro are required ; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 650 ( Black Band zone ) , to an average price of 800 ( L@@ ambi@@ ate zone , U@@ dine and F@@ ier@@ a ) , and on to a maximum of 900 ( Victoria zone ) .
In Florence a bed@@ -@@ space costs on average 350 / 400 Euro , a room approximately 700 .
In Bologna , where the students concentrate themselves in the areas closest to the university , 250 / 280 Euro are required for a bed@@ -@@ space in a double room , and from 3@@ 70 to 500 for a single .
In Rome in the zone near the central universities ( San Lor@@ enzo , Piazza Bologna ) approximately 600 Euro is the asking price for a single room , 450 Euro for a bed@@ -@@ space in a double room .
S@@ ligh@@ tly lower prices ( 5@@ 50 Euro for a single room ) in areas close to the other universities ( O@@ sti@@ ense and Cin@@ ec@@ itt@@ à ) .
Sav@@ ings are only possible by moving to the sub@@ ur@@ bs : 300 Euro for a bed@@ -@@ space and 450 for a single in areas such as P@@ ren@@ est@@ rin@@ a , Cent@@ oc@@ elle and similar places .
In Naples 300 / 450 Euro are required for a bed@@ -@@ space , for a single room one sp@@ ends 400 to 600 Euro , with the highest prices found in the Po@@ lic@@ lin@@ ico , V@@ om@@ ero , and Col@@ li A@@ min@@ ei areas .
In Bar@@ i for a bed@@ -@@ space 250 / 350 Euro are required , at least 350 for a single .
In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms , but they have a higher impact on the local economy .
In cities where r@@ enting to non-@@ EU students is a more frequent phenomenon , such as Peru@@ gia , there is a further an@@ om@@ al@@ y : the increase of about 25 / 30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from Italian students .
Goo@@ d@@ by@@ e old Cin@@ ema Par@@ adi@@ so , cities cancel historical theat@@ res
Histor@@ ical cin@@ em@@ at@@ ographic theat@@ res close in favour of Multi@@ ple@@ x .
&quot; A city without cin@@ em@@ at@@ ographic theat@@ res is a blind city , it &apos;s like a face without eyes &quot; .
The image offered by the director Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Tor@@ nat@@ ore eff@@ ic@@ aci@@ ously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provin@@ cial towns .
The si@@ del@@ ining process of the cin@@ em@@ as , with the birth in the outs@@ kir@@ ts of large multi-@@ hall theat@@ res and the consequ@@ ent death by consumption of the single-@@ hall theat@@ res within the central areas of the city , is one of those events that appears un@@ avo@@ idable and in@@ contro@@ verti@@ ble and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime .
Frequ@@ ently , it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear , &quot; it is as if a friend is lost , an acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance with whom we have shared the way and many memories » , ob@@ serves the director of New Cin@@ ema Par@@ adise , the film that twenty years ago gave Tor@@ nat@@ ore the O@@ scar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes , and which nar@@ rated the po@@ em of a provin@@ cial hall and the no@@ stal@@ gia for a way of living the cinema which , perhaps , has been lost forever .
The numbers provided by An@@ ec , the main cin@@ em@@ a-@@ operators association , speak clearly : within the last five years 3@@ 16 traditional style cin@@ em@@ as have closed shop , and the ones to pay the price were above all the theat@@ res in the principal cities : 10 less in Florence , 9 in Milan , Naples , Bologna , and Rome , 6 less in Turin , 5 in Pal@@ ermo .
Among the regions most badly hit by the clos@@ ures , Em@@ ili@@ a-@@ Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-@@ hall cin@@ em@@ as lost , followed by Tuscany ( 44 ) , and by Lom@@ bar@@ dy ( 41 ) .
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multi@@ ple@@ x is the most responsible for their dis@@ appearance , these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multi@@ ple@@ x cin@@ em@@ as registered : 19@@ 5 more screens in Lom@@ bar@@ dy in the last five years , 81 in both Tuscany and Em@@ ili@@ a-@@ Romagna .
« The Italian business has developed in an ir@@ rational way » ob@@ serves Pa@@ olo Prot@@ ti , An@@ ec &apos;s president , &quot; it &apos;s useful that new structures are built but it &apos;s also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed , because once a theatre in a city clos@@ es , not all its pat@@ r@@ ons may be inc@@ lined to transfer to the multip@@ lex@@ es .
Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators : the previous deb@@ it by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro .
It &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ceful , from the ethical and from the moral point of view , that the government does not respect the exist@@ ent laws .
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are required » .
An interesting example is that of Bologna , the first Italian city that , concerned by the clos@@ ures , has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and An@@ ec , the first of its kind in Italy , to protect and promote single-@@ hall cin@@ em@@ as both in the historical centre as well as on the outs@@ kir@@ ts .
Among the fores@@ een provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility : the spec@@ t@@ ators can enter in the traff@@ ic-@@ limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks .
« It &apos;s an initiative which I like » ob@@ serves Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Tor@@ nat@@ ore &quot; and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures .
It &apos;s certain though , that to contrast the excessive power of the multi@@ ple@@ x , traditional theat@@ res have also to improve the sound and image quality , because the public nowadays is more demanding .
The defence of traditional cin@@ em@@ as is a theme that for me has always been important : the closure of the Ba@@ gh@@ eria Su@@ perc@@ in@@ ema , the place of my inf@@ ancy and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence , was the spark that convinced me to create &quot; New Cin@@ ema Par@@ adi@@ so &quot; , on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years .
I have been living in Rome for 25 years , and when I pass in front of the Ri@@ alto or the Qu@@ ir@@ inal in National Street both closed by now , there where I have experienced many shared emotions , I turn away so as not to see the post@@ ers black@@ ened by the dust » .
T@@ ies between politics and ‘ n@@ d@@ ran@@ gh@@ eta arrested the may@@ or of Gi@@ o@@ ia Ta@@ ur@@ o
&quot; The may@@ or of Gi@@ o@@ ia Ta@@ ur@@ o was dis@@ posed towards con@@ forming municipal interests with those of the Pi@@ ro@@ mal@@ li gang &quot; .
The accus@@ ations that the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ates of the Cal@@ ab@@ res@@ e Anti-@@ ma@@ fia Office direct against the may@@ or and the dep@@ uty may@@ or of Gi@@ o@@ ia Ta@@ ur@@ o Gi@@ or@@ gio D@@ al Tor@@ ri@@ one and Ros@@ ario Schi@@ av@@ one , and the may@@ or of Ro@@ sar@@ no Carlo Mart@@ elli , who have been arrested this morning for external contest with ma@@ fia association , are very serious .
Also arrested is Gi@@ o@@ ac@@ ch@@ ino Pi@@ ro@@ mal@@ li , the senior medi@@ ator between the cl@@ an and the public administration offices , and his ne@@ ph@@ e@@ w - a lawyer , nam@@ es@@ ake of the bo@@ ss , already condemned for ma@@ fi@@ a-@@ style criminal association , condemned to rep@@ ay 10 million euro .
&quot; In cont@@ emp@@ t of all judicial and moral rules , and common sense &quot; , write the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultancy fees to the lawyer Pi@@ ro@@ mal@@ li .
&quot; In this way , it was allowed for the gang – the judges write – to officially pen@@ et@@ rate inside the municipality easing the already vast possibilities of controlling and direc@@ ting the public administration &quot; .
The president of the Cal@@ ab@@ res@@ e local council A@@ ga@@ zio Lo@@ ier@@ o does not hide that &quot; coll@@ u@@ sions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous &quot; within his region : &quot; there are areas where ma@@ fia presence is stronger and more intense than in others , where coll@@ u@@ sion is almost inevitable .
However , there are many local politicians who resist the pressure put on by the &apos; n@@ d@@ ran@@ gh@@ eta , her@@ oes who remain clean &quot; .
This morning &apos;s arres@@ ts follow those in July with which the police announced to have beh@@ e@@ aded the Pi@@ ro@@ mal@@ li gang .
At the end of last April , the municipal council of Gi@@ o@@ ia Ta@@ ur@@ o was dis@@ solved but already in 1991 , and always for presum@@ ed conditioning between organised crime and local administration , local politicians had been rel@@ iev@@ ed from duties of administration of the municipality .
Gi@@ or@@ gio D@@ al Tor@@ ri@@ one , the may@@ or of U@@ DC at the time of the dis@@ solution , had been elected head of a cent@@ re-@@ right coalition , after the May 2006 bal@@ lot .
He made a scandal out of it when the P@@ ref@@ ecture ordered the dis@@ solution of the municipal council .
He brought in cause the then vic@@ e-@@ minister of the Inter@@ ior Marco Min@@ niti acc@@ using him of having pl@@ ot@@ ted everything for political mo@@ tives , however the judges , in the arrest warrant signed this morning , have explained that the Pi@@ ro@@ mal@@ li gang had even arrived at asking for the vari@@ ation of the A@@ 3 project .
From the inter@@ cep@@ tions ordered on D@@ al Tor@@ ri@@ one , writes the public prosec@@ ution , has emerged &quot; a willingness to mar@@ ry the needs of an entreprene@@ ur , representative of a larger group not@@ ori@@ ously close to the Pi@@ ro@@ mal@@ li , align@@ ing the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang &quot; .
When energy is born from the waves the big come into play
It &apos;s an immense body , that occup@@ ies 70 % of the planet &apos;s surface and now the big , international energy companies are discovering it .
W@@ aves , curr@@ ents , ti@@ des are the new renewable sources being ey@@ ed , and subjected to attempts of development , by col@@ o@@ ssi such as Ch@@ ev@@ ron .
The possibility of extrac@@ ting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70 &apos;s , coinci@@ ding with the first oil crisis , research was intensi@@ fied .
When the oil prices went down , around 1980 , the idea of explo@@ iting marine energy was put aside , but now the appe@@ als by the environment@@ alists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector .
The World Energy Council ( W@@ EC ) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world &apos;s electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas &apos; und@@ ulating motion .
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations .
And then there would be the curr@@ ents and the ti@@ des .
C@@ olo@@ ssi on the attack .
The first company to bet on marine energy was En@@ er@@ sis , which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal .
When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step .
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these , there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy .
&quot; Ch@@ ev@@ ron is resear@@ ching technologies for oc@@ e@@ an@@ ic energy – a spo@@ kes@@ person for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal – and is evalu@@ ating the possibility of collabor@@ ating with us &quot; .
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission , necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Al@@ as@@ ka .
This is a significant sign , especially if one considers that right in Al@@ as@@ ka the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new dri@@ lling .
Besides Ch@@ ev@@ ron there are Ver@@ d@@ ant Power Inc . Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jer@@ sey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far , even though they are not known in detail , indicate according to the observers an increasing interest .
Technology to be made ready .
Exper@@ ts talk about a technology still in its inf@@ ancy , marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact .
T@@ ill now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the eco@@ system .
To produce energy on a large scale , however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented .
And the choices are varied : Ocean Power , for example , uses a system of bu@@ o@@ ys connected between themselves .
The thr@@ ust of the waves , which makes the bu@@ o@@ ys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pist@@ ons and cy@@ lin@@ ders inside the flo@@ aters .
The pressure turns a tur@@ b@@ ine which in its turn fuels a generator .
The electricity is sent to shore through under@@ water c@@ ables .
For now there are four plants of this kind being planned , waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation .
Ver@@ d@@ ant Power , on the other hand , already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six under@@ water tur@@ bin@@ es in New York &apos;s East River .
The water movement when there are the sea ti@@ des makes the fans of the tur@@ bin@@ es go round , creating a rot@@ ary motion that powers a generator .
Ver@@ d@@ ant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary author@@ is@@ ations to benefit from the energy .
After the waves , the ti@@ des .
Partic@@ ular interest , declare the people at the Electri@@ cal Energy Research Institute , is deser@@ ved at the moment by the potential of ti@@ des .
Even though it is an inter@@ mitt@@ ent phenomenon , the ti@@ de is more predictable than the wind , the sun , or the waves , and so is more reliable as a source of energy .
It &apos;s exactly on ti@@ dal energy that states such as New York , Ma@@ ine , and Al@@ as@@ ka , together with others that over@@ look the coast , have already invested 7.@@ 5 million dollars in 2008 and are fores@@ een investments of up to 35 million for 2009 .
