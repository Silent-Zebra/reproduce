Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Fre@@ eing Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko
Today , the Ukraine parliament dis@@ missed , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to re@@ vo@@ ke an article based on which the opposition leader , Y@@ uli@@ a Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko , was sent@@ enced .
The amendment that would lead to fre@@ eing the impris@@ oned former Prime Minister was rev@@ oked during second reading of the proposal for mitig@@ ation of sentences for economic offences .
In October , Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko was sent@@ enced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a dis@@ advan@@ tage@@ ous gas deal with Russia .
The ver@@ dict is not yet final ; the court will hear Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko &apos;s appeal in December .
Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko claims the ver@@ dict is a political re@@ ven@@ ge of the regime ; in the West , the trial has also ev@@ oked sus@@ pic@@ ion of being bi@@ ased .
The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sent@@ enced , was supported by 14@@ 7 members of parliament .
Its ratification would require 2@@ 26 votes .
Libya &apos;s Vic@@ tory
The story of Libya &apos;s liber@@ ation , or re@@ bel@@ lion , already has its defe@@ ated .
Mu@@ amm@@ ar K@@ add@@ af@@ i is bur@@ ied at an unknown place in the desert . Without him , the war is over .
It is time to define the winners .
As a rule , Islam@@ ists win in the country ; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
The transitional cab@@ inet declared itself a follow@@ er of the custom@@ ary Sh@@ aria law , of which we have already heard .
Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for ste@@ aling is having one &apos;s hand amp@@ ut@@ ated .
Women can forget about eman@@ cip@@ ation ; potential religious ren@@ eg@@ ades will be executed ; etc .
Instead of a dict@@ ator , a society consisting of competing tri@@ bes will be united by Kor@@ an .
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
However , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .
In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic figh@@ ters accepted help from the non@@ bel@@ ie@@ vers .
Their only excuse is that from their point of view , NATO ra@@ ids were not controlled by an American general , but Allah , the great@@ ness of whom they celebrated with each strike .
When winners are sought for in Libya , the West is not on the list .
We participated in a shooting , served Islam , and our politicians got rid of a dict@@ ator , their political ally , without any guarantee of profit .
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq , we decided against military occupation of Libya .
The locals thus do not have to worry about exp@@ elling of the &quot; crus@@ aders . &quot;
Without the occupation , will the oil companies get Libya &apos;s black gold for next to nothing , though ?
It is quite likely that they will not . The West will then finally be able to bo@@ ast about its sel@@ fl@@ ess protection of human rights .
Unless the fol@@ lo@@ wers of the Sh@@ aria law put a stop to that .
New Er@@ a of Cris@@ is Comm@@ ences
France and the rest of Europe are now in the investors &quot; spot@@ light .
A statistical storm ble@@ w over Europe on Tuesday .
Individu@@ al countries released their 3@@ Q GDP data .
Between quarters , the Czech economy stag@@ n@@ ated ; Germany and France are growing .
Yet the deb@@ it market is breaking records today .
Invest@@ ors are no longer looking at only Italy ; they now focus on Spain , France , Austria , and others .
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany , Czech Republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
Germany &apos;s GDP has grown by the expected 0.5 % ; and France &apos;s by 0.@@ 4 % .
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where Germany did better than expected ( a 0.@@ 3 % increase instead of the original 0.@@ 1 % ) . France reported a slight decrease , by 0.@@ 1 % ( the original information suggested stag@@ nation ) .
In this year &apos;s third quarter , the Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % .
Between the quarters though , the GDP stag@@ n@@ ated . According to the Czech St@@ atis@@ tical Office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual s@@ lowing of economic growth .
The results are worse than estimates by an@@ alyst@@ s .
Key events :
In this year &apos;s third quarter , Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5 % ; however , it stag@@ n@@ ated between the quarters .
Based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the German economy grew by 0.5 % .
Between July and September , the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew , compared to the previous quarter , by 0.@@ 2 % , which corresponds with estimates by an@@ alyst@@ s .
The Greek economy showed an interim decrease of 5.@@ 2 % .
The earnings on its 10-@@ year bonds are 28@@ .@@ 45 % .
Ear@@ nings of both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits .
Even Austria , Netherlands , France , and Belgium , etc. are beginning to experience problems .
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , earnings of Czech 1 - year bonds stay under 4 % .
Vo@@ ices are coming from Germany , suggest@@ ing that ECB be the last resort credi@@ tor .
Cz@@ ech@@ s qualified for EURO .
In Montenegro they won 1 : 0 and celebrate a 200 million wind@@ fall .
Foot@@ ball representation successfully managed the tou@@ gh@@ est task of the season !
Thanks to both the great Č@@ ech and beautiful goal of Pet@@ r J@@ ir@@ á@@ č@@ ek , they won 1 : 0 .
In the second half , Czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the European Championship .
I@@ H@@ NE@@ D.@@ cz wat@@ ched the progress match in a detailed report .
N@@ early no exc@@ itement in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
Czech representation team , partially due to the home team &apos;s failure in the close ; the great Č@@ ech ; and hero@@ ic J@@ ir@@ á@@ č@@ ek ; won 1 : 0 in Montenegro , and celeb@@ rates moving on to the European Championship .
Perfect Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
Dam@@ jan@@ ovi@@ c and V@@ u@@ cin@@ ic became the match &apos;s least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities .
The wonderful Pet@@ r Č@@ ech is one of the reasons the Czech representation team will not miss the next year &apos;s European Championship . And Czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million Czech Crow@@ ns .
From the opening minutes , the game was very pu@@ gn@@ acious .
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid-@@ field line most of the time .
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half . Long k@@ ic@@ ks behind the defence were ne@@ at@@ ly aver@@ ted by the Czech defence .
Iranian Stu@@ dents Are Pre@@ par@@ ed to Die for Their Country &apos;s Nuclear Program
They created a live shi@@ eld .
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran .
The gest@@ ure is to express their support of their country &apos;s nuclear program against a possible Israel attack .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; pra@@ yers in front of the building were followed by their ch@@ anting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Iran , several hundred university students created a live chain around Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an U@@ ran@@ ium Con@@ version Facili@@ ty .
This way , they express their read@@ iness to protect their country &apos;s nuclear program with their own lives .
In its recent report , the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency ( IA@@ EA ) stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped stri@@ ving for a nuclear weapon .
Pos@@ sible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel .
At Tuesday noon , students &apos; pra@@ yers in front of the entrance into Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an U@@ ran@@ ium Con@@ version Facili@@ ty were followed by their ch@@ anting of death to both the USA and Israel .
In case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible par@@ aly@@ sation of the Iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on Israel press , the facilities in both Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an and Nat@@ anz , where the ur@@ anium is being enrich@@ ed .
An O@@ bes@@ e Child &apos;s Di@@ et : No breakfast and s@@ aus@@ age for dinner
Over a third of children between 9 and 13 are over@@ weight ; while 9 % of school@@ children are over@@ weight , 5 % are o@@ bes@@ e .
As a recent research shows , o@@ bes@@ e children usually come from families with un@@ healthy lifestyle .
Again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
For example , s@@ aus@@ ages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of o@@ bes@@ e children compared to the families of children with standard weight .
Over 19 % of o@@ bes@@ e children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called O@@ bes@@ ity is No Ac@@ ci@@ dent .
Moreover , the families of o@@ bes@@ e children do not prac@@ tise sports . However , this concerns a majority of families of current school@@ children - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
The research was performed among 900 children .
The research took place at the end of last year &apos;s school year ; it included almost 900 el@@ ementary school children from throughout Boh@@ em@@ ia .
It was the second year of the O@@ bes@@ ity is No Ac@@ ci@@ dent event supported by both V@@ š@@ e@@ ob@@ ec@@ n@@ á z@@ dra@@ vot@@ n@@ í po@@ ji@@ š@@ ť@@ ov@@ na insurance company and Uni@@ le@@ ver .
So far , the project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades .
Pro@@ per diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either over@@ weight or o@@ bes@@ e .
&quot; For example , only half of those in@@ quired said they have five meals a day , in the break@@ fast@@ -@@ sn@@ ack@@ -@@ lun@@ ch-@@ sn@@ ack@@ -@@ dinner pattern , one of the basic pre@@ conditions of correct diet , &quot; one of the results of the research says .
No lunch and s@@ aus@@ age in the evening
Exper@@ ts war@@ n that even relative details are crucial for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .
In the Czech Republic , only 23 % of school@@ children &apos;s families have breakfast together .
In a majority of families , everyone has breakfast separately .
The worst discovery was the fact that in one ten@@ th of households people do not have breakfast at all .
Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet .
A survey has shown that fri@@ es are consum@@ ed more often in the families of o@@ bes@@ e children .
N@@ early everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks every day ( 70 % ) .
Though over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number dro@@ ps down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
Com@@ pose your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 20@@ 4 boys and 17@@ 2 girls from 13 schools ) to com@@ pose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
&quot; Di@@ et preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal as regards healthy diet . &quot;
Their favourite meals include large number of flo@@ ur , meat , and sweet dishes .
&quot; Especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , &quot; the final report of the survey concludes .
As the main dish for lunch , past@@ a won very tigh@@ tly over p@@ oul@@ try .
However , children showed very little interest in leg@@ umes , fish , and vegetable lun@@ ches .
Ten@@ dency towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating hab@@ its provided they are given correct information .
&quot; Many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a question@@ n@@ aire after the end of the O@@ bes@@ ity is No Ac@@ ci@@ dent educational lec@@ ture , &quot; project results show .
This was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would begin to prefer plain water .
In addition , for their main course , children tick@@ ed p@@ oul@@ try and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and dum@@ pl@@ ings .
A Sty@@ list M@@ ust Also Be a Good Psych@@ ologist , Profession@@ als C@@ la@@ im
In the opening article on sty@@ list training , I was compl@@ aining a bit about the amount of information in the introduc@@ tory lessons .
I had no idea what was coming .
L@@ ec@@ tures by three experts from the field ; dres@@ sing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in prac@@ tise .
And more is yet to come .
The closer we get to the final ex@@ am , the more information and practical tasks await .
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday , but it is really packed with information .
This time , together with Al@@ en@@ ka , the Director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect sy@@ mm@@ etry .
A majority of women are not perfectly sy@@ mm@@ etri@@ cal .
One has a short neck , the other has a boy@@ ish figure without proper cur@@ ves , yet another is over@@ weight .
A sty@@ list must know how to op@@ tically sof@@ ten wide shoul@@ ders , make the neck look longer , or add the cur@@ ves necessary .
We were given tips on how to acc@@ entu@@ ate the figure of women such as J@@ enni@@ fer L@@ op@@ ez , i.e. with bigger bre@@ asts and hi@@ ps and narrow wa@@ ist , and not to dress them too pro@@ voc@@ atively .
For example , if the difference between the wa@@ ist and hi@@ ps is such that the sk@@ ir@@ t or tro@@ users do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom@@ -@@ made .
You will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are pri@@ cel@@ ess .
In a custom@@ -@@ made sk@@ ir@@ t , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shi@@ fting , rolling up , sti@@ cking out in your wa@@ ist , etc .
Bo@@ y@@ ish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ru@@ ff@@ ling , app@@ liqu@@ é , em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y , or shi@@ r@@ ring .
Given the abund@@ ance of such information and figure types , I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
Still , I fear it is too much , with regard to the home@@ work we were given .
Each of the course participants was given a celebr@@ ity to create two out@@ fits for : day and night .
We must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
I am to dress Mir@@ anda Ker@@ r whom you may know from the Victoria &apos;s Sec@@ ret campaigns .
In@@ side I re@@ jo@@ ice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars , Christ@@ ina A@@ guil@@ era , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand I am exagger@@ ating ) , or the very young Sel@@ ena Gom@@ ez .
We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphi@@ cally process them .
M@@ oo@@ d@@ board , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depic@@ tion .
It is important to think about the graphic part of sty@@ ling .
A sty@@ list does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy pur@@ ses , co@@ ats , etc . ) .
This is what a sty@@ list and designer , Mario Kam@@ en@@ í@@ k , was telling us about .
But that was not until Sunday .
A sty@@ list needs general knowledge
Saturday &apos;s lec@@ ture , filled with information on figure types , was li@@ ven@@ ed up by three guests from the field .
A sty@@ list , Hon@@ za Po@@ kor@@ n@@ ý ; a fashion designer , Jak@@ ub Pol@@ an@@ ka ; and a fashion photographer , Ben Ren@@ č .
Jak@@ ub reminded us that fashion is an illu@@ sion , and a sty@@ list should be able to use this fact .
A good sty@@ list can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
In this case , vari@@ ability is key .
For example , a tr@@ en@@ ch coat may be worn in the standard way , over je@@ ans and T-@@ shirt , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on n@@ aked body , with step@@ -@@ ins , as a dress .
Another option is rolling up the sle@@ ev@@ es or coll@@ ar , and the entire look changes completely .
&quot; Play with it , &quot; he emphasised .
However , I appreciated the following advice the most : &quot; For your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . &quot;
&apos;@@ Then you can start breaking them , &apos; Jak@@ ub told us .
Here I finally understood why we dri@@ ll all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
Not to mention fashion shows .
From Ben , the photographer , I learned that a sty@@ list must have more out@@ fit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
So , for a ten-@@ page fashion story ( equ@@ als ten out@@ fits ) , I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
Now I also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an out@@ fit .
Hon@@ za Po@@ kor@@ n@@ ý confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
Just look at Mad@@ onna , who is no mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
The attitude towards sty@@ list services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic .
Even famous people often consider it redundant ( believ@@ ing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
And if someone finally lets us create their sty@@ ling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
Then , we are left to Google and find out if the tab@@ lo@@ ids wrote something about a celebr@@ ity gaining / losing weight , etc .
On Sunday , both Hon@@ za and Mario were stres@@ sing the fact that for a sty@@ list it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an out@@ fit .
Our work chi@@ ef@@ ly consists of communic@@ ating with people we dress ; it is therefore important to be a good psych@@ ologist .
To be able to estimate people , not to p@@ ander , and stick to one &apos;s opinion .
&quot; If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire war@@ dro@@ be telling her how aw@@ ful the clothes are . &quot;
&quot; Find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with &quot; Mario says .
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
That is the bag you fa@@ sten around your wa@@ ist to carry all the pro@@ ps you need .
A@@ side from the obvious things , such as sc@@ iss@@ ors , a sti@@ cky roll@@ er , or safety p@@ ins , it should have a n@@ yl@@ on thread ( for the sty@@ list to use when taking pictures of products such as pur@@ ses or h@@ ats ) , special cli@@ p-@@ ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( p@@ ins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a se@@ wing set .
To have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly under@@ lay shoe sol@@ es .
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the sol@@ es might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
And so we were sti@@ cking away .
You must not touch the shoes with the sc@@ iss@@ ors , to avoid any damage .
This requires real skill .
Mario pleased me by pra@@ ising my job .
The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea .
This is just a frag@@ ment of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional sty@@ list is no piece of c@@ ake , no matter what people say .
V Ne@@ ed for Speed : The R@@ un takes place across America .
Review
An originally car@@ ef@@ ree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous and sl@@ opp@@ y mistakes .
The ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
Before it was released , the new version sub@@ ti@@ tled The R@@ un created high expectations .
It promised to shift the old Ne@@ ed For Speed racing series in a new direction ; the demo@@ s made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing gen@@ re .
We were cur@@ ious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
Typ@@ ical for the N@@ FS series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
The game represents a possibly decent arc@@ ade race , but the whole is bur@@ dened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .
This means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an in@@ comprehensible la@@ zin@@ ess of the developers .
The adventure opens very well .
You are introduced into a story , where the main character , Jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America .
You get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach New York .
The idea brings several interesting features .
The route is divided into ten stages , sub@@ divided into over fif@@ ty races .
This means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
Still , it is nothing world-@@ sh@@ atter@@ ing .
Dri@@ ving through the desert , aut@@ um@@ n@@ al countryside , or high in snow@@ -@@ covered mountains is vis@@ ually very pleasant though .
In addition , the races are , from time to time , en@@ li@@ ven@@ ed by an un@@ typical feature .
For example , in the desert , you get into a sand@@ storm , significantly decre@@ asing the visibility .
On the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an av@@ al@@ anche .
Individu@@ al races are ordered fairly well .
There are just a few types , but it is sufficient .
For a while , you try to over@@ take a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard stop@@ watch race ) ; or you are in a du@@ el with a single ri@@ val .
On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .
The parts outside the car are new .
They are just interactive anim@@ ations , where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time .
Nothing difficult .
It is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect ( just three to be precise ) .
It actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be bor@@ ing ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more enter@@ taining .
The driving model follows the foot@@ steps of the previous parts .
This means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
If you are looking for a real-@@ to-@@ life simulation , you will have to look elsewhere .
Still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .
So far , everything is just right .
However , after some time , problems come .
In contrast with the driving model , the col@@ li@@ sion model is not that good .
From a game of this type , one does not expect complicated de@@ form@@ ations and col@@ li@@ sions , but when you have no idea , before cr@@ ash@@ ing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
Typ@@ ically , when over@@ taking or passing cars tigh@@ tly in common traffic , you sometimes ligh@@ tly touch the other car . Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
Or , cr@@ ashed completely .
This is not such a big deal due to the rest@@ art system , but is enough to spo@@ il the fun .
The res@@ tar@@ ts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
Nevertheless , there are only five res@@ tar@@ ts available per each race .
If you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
This makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
Sometimes the res@@ tar@@ ts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
A significant short@@ coming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .
For example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later .
This is especially anno@@ ying in situations where you can see how your ri@@ val drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
It makes no difference when you get to them ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose .
The competitors have other advantages , too .
While playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same competi@@ tor over@@ takes you at the very same spot .
This is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
Obviously , your ri@@ val has to get in front of you no matter what .
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .
One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in-@@ filled , but it is so obvious it gets anno@@ ying quickly .
It &apos;s a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is enter@@ taining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
It is not important whether the reason you do not get bor@@ ed is the concept with fif@@ ty unique tracks , ordering of races , or something else .
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual .
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .
Car@@ s are divided into three categories .
Sports cars are suitable for cities ; strong American cars for straight highway sections ; and exotic super@@ sports cars for technical driving , such as along cro@@ oked mountain tracks .
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
Here , you gain both med@@ als and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
Various features un@@ lock f@@ ir getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile back@@ grounds .
Again , the profile is inter@@ connected with an on-line Aut@@ olo@@ g function , which , among other things , compar@@ es the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
Yet another set@@ back difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .
You and your car get into a subway tunnel ( let &apos;s say you do ) , where you speed down the tracks in the dark@@ ness ( let &apos;s say you do ) .
Your spe@@ ed@@ ometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( let &apos;s say it does ) , when suddenly , a subway train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pi@@ le of scra@@ p metal .
For several days , our edi@@ torial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such mor@@ ons .
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
It is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather trag@@ ically , decre@@ ases .
This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where flu@@ ent reco@@ ding would not help you much anyway .
The sound is all right ; the sound@@ track is a matter of taste .
In order to please the wi@@ dest possible young audience , the sound@@ track is &apos; fl@@ ec@@ ked in from all quarters &apos; ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
Overall impression of Ne@@ ed for Speed : The R@@ un is quite confused .
If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that The R@@ un is the best part of N@@ FS for the past several years .
However , the game feels un@@ finished .
It surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be blin@@ ded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spot@@ lights .

&quot; Lisbon Treaty caused significant im@@ balance between individual institutions . &quot;
&quot; I did not expect it to be such a tough war . &quot;
&quot; It will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , &quot; EU Ambass@@ ad@@ ress Mil@@ ena Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á opened her lec@@ ture at the Law Department sharp@@ ly .
She proved how true she is to her &quot; Clearly and openly about Europe &quot; motto in the very first part of her lec@@ ture , where she described individual EU organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelli@@ gible , way that many lec@@ tur@@ ers from the UK Law D@@ ept@@ . could be je@@ al@@ ous .
Moreover , Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á pra@@ ised the work of new long-term President of the European Council , Herman Van Romp@@ u@@ y :
&quot; At first , critics said he was plain , a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles ; I have to say everyone was amaz@@ ed at how wonder@@ fully he acqu@@ itted his role . &quot;
&quot; He is a person who can listen to all twenty-@@ seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the EU should be headed . &quot;
She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : &quot; Who is the European Union ? Which phone number should I call ? &quot; ; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union &apos;s policy towards countries such as China or India .
No One W@@ ants To B@@ an Our Che@@ ese Speci@@ alties
Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past , present , and near future .
She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success .
Cz@@ ech@@ s were dealing with the coming financial crisis ; they solved the as crisis ; and organised the East Partnership Summit .
She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic .
Currently , Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy .
As the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stir@@ ring .
In addition , a new sev@@ en-@@ year EU budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .
Whether the budget will be sli@@ m and fru@@ gal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
The amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress reminded the key slo@@ gan@@ s she took to Brussels : &quot; About Europe , Clearly . &quot;
&quot; I really do not like all the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , foreign words , and jar@@ gon no one understands .
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels , people are not trying to come up with cro@@ oked or round cu@@ cum@@ bers , different size ban@@ anas , or that someone wants to ban our cheese speci@@ alties . &apos;
She also wants to use the EU environment better , and get more Cz@@ ech@@ s into European institutions .
Multi@@ speed Europe Is Com@@ ing
The amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ress says Cz@@ ech@@ s are said to be Euro-@@ scep@@ tics ; as well as people notic@@ ing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions .
She thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the mo@@ dest@@ y of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the Czech side .
Along with the success of Czech presidency , she highlighted the power and cooperation of the Vis@@ eg@@ rad Group .
&quot; Bel@@ ieve me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary , and a Slovak is coming to join us , the Fren@@ ch@@ man next to me says : &quot; H@@ ey , what &apos;s that gathering about , is that the Vis@@ eg@@ rad Group again ? &apos; and he is not happy about it in the sligh@@ test . &apos;
In the Union &apos;s future , Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states .
Rather than a new European Federation , she finds the concept of two-@@ speed , if not multi-@@ speed Europe , very realistic .
&quot; We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; We have Schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . &quot;
&quot; For the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . &quot;
&quot; The number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two-@@ speed Europe , &quot; Vic@@ en@@ ov@@ á expects .
In this regard , she appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Romp@@ u@@ y in pushing forward the rule based on which , all topics influ@@ encing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states , and not just those belonging into the Eurozone .
Brand St@@ ory :
The IM@@ B Innov@@ ator Star@@ ts the Second Century of Its Exist@@ ence
Should someone search for the word that would best express the IM@@ B strategy , the closest one would probably be &quot; long-term . &quot;
To the wide public , IM@@ B is a symbol of technological revolution ; the company is seen as a highly temporary one , yet it was founded over a hundred years ago .
The company &apos;s dur@@ ability goes back to its first bo@@ ss , a vision@@ ary , Thomas J. Watson S@@ r.
He believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
His motto : &apos; Th@@ ink ! &apos; thus become an im@@ print around which the life of the future giant would un@@ fold ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that IM@@ B started to publish in 19@@ 35 ) .
Moreover , it was the foundation of company culture Watson was building carefully .
&quot; For us in IM@@ B , long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .
IM@@ B survi@@ ved and flour@@ ished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around itself .
During our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
In the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , &quot; says current company Director , Sam@@ uel J. Pal@@ mis@@ ano , on the occasion of the anniversary .
S@@ ophistic@@ ated System
In the 1930@@ s , Watson appro@@ ached employee care simil@@ arly to Ba@@ ť@@ a in the Czech Republic - people from IM@@ B were among the first American employees to have a paid holiday , insurance from their employ@@ er , an elegant uniform , and a sophisticated system of bon@@ uses for the best invent@@ ors and business@@ men .
Just as sophisticated is IBM &apos;s long-term relationship with customers .
From the very beginning , the company was brilliant in explo@@ iting tal@@ ented people . It was one of the first world companies to abo@@ lish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .
Con@@ sist@@ ent with the anti-@@ discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , Vir@@ g@@ inia Rom@@ et@@ ty , to take over after Pal@@ mis@@ ano next year .
She has been working in IM@@ B for thirty years ; she is currently a Director of Sales , Marketing , and Strategy .
In the last few years , IM@@ B has been organising j@@ ams , on-line bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
It is no surprise that the ideas are pl@@ enti@@ ful - the company emplo@@ ys nearly half a million people .
Institution with a Good Rep@@ utation
Company &apos;s strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .
&quot; From the beginning , the concept of IBM was that of an institution rather than a technology company , &apos; a Harv@@ ard Business School Professor and author of a book about IBM , Ros@@ ab@@ eth Mo@@ ss Kan@@ ter , told the Econom@@ ist .
&quot; IBM is not a technology firm ; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology , &quot; George Col@@ ony of For@@ res@@ ter Research consultation company adds .
As the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
During the hundred years , IM@@ B , or the &quot; Big Blue , &quot; as it is called in the US because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nan@@ otechn@@ ologies .
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price .
Its inven@@ tions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial sw@@ ap , bar code , and fl@@ opp@@ y disc .
With about 220 billion dollars , based on market capit@@ alisation , IBM has become the second largest technology company ( Apple being number one ) this year , over@@ running Microsoft for the first time since 1996 .
View A@@ head
Not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period . For example , IBM failed with its own operating system OS / 2 ; Pro@@ dig@@ y on-line services ; and IBM PC@@ j@@ r computers .
&quot; If your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emo@@ tionally attached to the past , &apos; says Sam@@ uel J. Pal@@ mis@@ ano .
That is why IBM easily buil@@ ds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work , it leaves them .
This is how it diff@@ ers from , for example , its competi@@ tor , Microsoft , which basically stands and falls on Windows , its operating system .
Per@@ spective Technology
IBM &apos;s revenues chi@@ ef@@ ly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .
While in 1990 , with over a half share , it was the strongest hardware representative .
Since 2000 , IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . During the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
It has continued the investments even after 2008 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .
IBM follows the legacy of its first director , Thomas J. Watson , who increased the amount of investments during the Great Depression .
So far , IM@@ B seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm .
Since the beginning of 2008 , the price of IBM &apos;s shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company &apos;s net earnings have been growing continuously .
IBM &apos;s company motto is to change everything , except for its values .
We may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .
IBM History : From Che@@ ese C@@ utter To Space Travel
IBM ( International Business Mach@@ ines ) was founded in New York , a hundred years ago . Its original name &quot; Comp@@ uting Tab@@ ulating Rec@@ ording Corporation &quot; was quite complicated .
It took the name of IBM in 19@@ 24 . Origin@@ ally , this was a brand used for company &apos;s branches in Canada and South America .
Found@@ ations for the later IBM were laid by a mer@@ ger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 18@@ 8@@ 0s .
They owned technologies such as the legendary &quot; time clock , &quot; i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work .
The architect of the new company was a business@@ man , Charles Ran@@ let@@ t F@@ lin@@ t , who , until 1930 , also presi@@ ded over the company &apos;s Board of Tru@@ ste@@ es .
F@@ lin@@ t hi@@ red a director of a competing company , Thomas J. Watson , to help him with company management .
The leader then put the IBM &apos;s founder in the sha@@ de - Watson &apos;s ideas remain the base for inv@@ inci@@ ble company culture and identity .
Watson led the company until 195@@ 2 .
IBM , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cut@@ ters to cash regi@@ sters .
During the first four years of Watson &apos;s leadership , the revenue doub@@ led to nine million dollars , and company &apos;s vast expansion into all continents comm@@ enced .
Watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly for@@ ty years , his position in the director &apos;s chair was taken by his son , Thomas Watson Junior .
Under his leadership , IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .
In 196@@ 0s , both people and computers from IBM helped N@@ ASA control space flights - to Mer@@ cury , Satur@@ n , and in 1969 , man &apos;s flight to the Mo@@ on .
Meanwhile , in 1964 , IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM line System / 360 .
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the period , called IBM 5@@ 150 , came to the market in 1981 .
Tw@@ enty years later , IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company , Len@@ ovo , While buying the consult@@ ant division of Pri@@ ce@@ water@@ hou@@ se@@ Co@@ op@@ ers , and thus comm@@ enced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .
In the past three years , IBM has been highly successful with its Smar@@ ter Planet concept .
Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management .
For commerce , IBM has recently introduced a Smar@@ ter Commerce platform that helps business@@ men control the whole commerce cycle .
IBM &apos;s history is strong even in our country .
In former Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia , as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe , IBM founded its branch in 19@@ 32 .
Today , IBM C@@ Z also runs a strategic out@@ sourcing centre in Br@@ no .
The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe resi@@ des in Prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .
Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á about her Un@@ fai@@ thful Hus@@ band :
I@@ veto , keep the f@@ ool , I don &apos;t want him anymore !
Dar@@ ina Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á ( 53 ) said it is over !
After her husband , Josef Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř ( 53 ) , became both the bo@@ dy@@ guard and lo@@ ver of I@@ v@@ eta Bar@@ to@@ š@@ ov@@ á ( 45 ) , Dar@@ ina still hoped he would wake up and come back home .
However , she does not want to wait any longer , and set clear rules for her future life .
&quot; Pep@@ a may return home , but no longer as my partner , &quot; Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á explained .
When Dar@@ ina Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á provided shel@@ ter for Bar@@ to@@ š@@ ov@@ á in her house in summer , she probably had not the sligh@@ test idea of what was going to happen to her marriage .
Even though she had I@@ v@@ eta move out of Ř@@ í@@ č@@ any 30 days later , Pep@@ a would not leave the singer .
Moreover , he public@@ ally admitted he loved her .
After some time , Dar@@ ina resign@@ ed , pret@@ ended to accept her husband &apos;s affair ; and now she gave him her final good@@ by@@ e .
Ry@@ ch@@ y@@ t@@ á@@ ř does not care who his wife sle@@ eps with
Even if one day Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř and Bar@@ to@@ š@@ ov@@ á would split up , his wife will not welcome him with open arms .
&quot; He is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house , no one will ch@@ ase him out . &quot;
&quot; However , he will complete his days not as my bel@@ o@@ ved , lost and found old f@@ ool , but as a person I have certain bonds to , &quot; Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á said , adding she had already dis@@ engaged herself from her husband and only insi@@ sts on mutual dec@@ ency .
So far , Josef does not mind that his wife closed the h@@ ind gate on him .
&quot; I respect my wife &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; I will be with I@@ v@@ eta , and I don &apos;t mean to change that . &quot;
&quot; My wife decided for marriage on paper , and I respect it . &quot;
&quot; Our company still operates ; I am in charge of rep@@ airs , garden , the house , and shopping . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ ina and I communicate in a completely normal way , only we do not share our bed anymore , &quot; Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř said for Bl@@ es@@ k .
He claims that if Ry@@ cht@@ á@@ ř@@ ov@@ á found a new love , he would not stand in her way .
&quot; We don &apos;t sleep together , and I don &apos;t care where she goes , with whom , and if she has a boy@@ friend .
I know it &apos;s my fault , I fell in love with I@@ v@@ eta , and I accept full responsibility , &quot; Josef concluded .
The Wor@@ st F@@ emin@@ ine Hab@@ its : Do They Conc@@ ern You ?
When you ask men to name some typical bad hab@@ its women have , they usually come up with all of them in an instant .
De@@ ar ladies , do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow , descri@@ bing several women &apos;s hab@@ its that make the men see red ?
Shopping
Does your other half compl@@ ain you are ad@@ dic@@ ted to shopping ?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week ?
Do you like shopping , in mass sales ?
If so , then your shopping may be seen as bad hab@@ it .
Some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping .
Still , who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all ( ideally , in various colour versions ) in the changing rooms ?
Shopping may be a h@@ ob@@ by for a majority of women , but for men , it may become absolute hell .
Just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside ...
Per@@ man@@ ent Dis@@ satisfaction
&quot; Am I too fat ? &quot;
&quot; I need to lose at least five ki@@ los - should I start doing some exercise ? &quot;
&quot; Are you still attracted to me ? &quot;
Do you find these sentences familiar ?
You do ?
Then , you belong to the group of women obs@@ essed by their appearance .
Not that you should stop looking after yourself , but many men are literary all@@ erg@@ ic to their partners &quot; constant complaints about their looks .
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more anno@@ ying women are .
Order and Cle@@ an@@ liness First
It is like a never ending story .
Cleaning the windows , vacu@@ um@@ ing , wi@@ ping the floors , du@@ sting , sc@@ rub@@ bing the bath@@ tub - at least twice a week .
Do you blame your partner for step@@ ping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes ; your children for mess@@ ing up a clean s@@ ink and leaving finger@@ prints over the glass pan@@ e in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
In case you suffer from this &quot; devi@@ ation , &quot; try to realise that no extrem@@ es are good ; and that within your family , order and clean@@ liness should not go first .
This harm@@ less desire for clean@@ liness may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire family .
Bo@@ ss@@ ing About
&quot; Th@@ row the under@@ wear into the bin . &quot;
&quot; Do you plan to wear the dirty so@@ cks tomorrow ? &quot;
&quot; W@@ et dish@@ towels do not belong on the floor . &quot;
If you bo@@ ss your partner around several times a day , he may find it very anno@@ ying .
Naturally , you mean well , you just want everything to be perfect .
Maybe , if men realised that , women would not have to bo@@ ss them around so much ...
Go@@ ssi@@ ping
Some women love go@@ ssi@@ ping , off@@ ending , and pl@@ ot@@ ting against others .
Women are focused on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
Every now and then , probably each of us releases a go@@ ssi@@ p here or there .
Let &apos;s be fran@@ k , this is probably the nature all women .
However , there are tou@@ gher go@@ ssi@@ ps , women who enjoy frequent go@@ ssi@@ ping and des@@ p@@ ise everyone . They are , especially within a female work team , very dangerous for their surroundings .
Assi@@ sts of J@@ á@@ g@@ r and Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek Hel@@ ped Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a &apos;s Vic@@ tory
During Monday &apos;s N@@ H@@ L match , ho@@ ck@@ ey forward , J@@ arom@@ í@@ r J@@ á@@ g@@ r &apos;s two assi@@ sts helped Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a &apos;s victory 5 : 3 on Carol@@ ina &apos;s ice . Again , he leads the productivity of Czech players in the game .
In both cases , Claude Gi@@ rou@@ x , used the experience of a thir@@ ty-@@ nine year old star ; he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
Two assi@@ sts in the match also belong@@ ed to J@@ á@@ g@@ r &apos;s te@@ am-@@ m@@ ate , Jak@@ ub Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek .
After the match , J@@ á@@ g@@ r told the overseas journalists he had predic@@ ted a great evening for Gi@@ rou@@ x .
&quot; I told him before the match he would score a h@@ at-@@ tri@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; I felt it . &quot;
&quot; You sometimes feel such things , &quot; explained J@@ á@@ g@@ r , after whose action Gi@@ rou@@ x sc@@ ored a goal on the first Fl@@ yers &quot; shot .
A little bit later , second score for the team b@@ ore Czech traces too .
The tra@@ iling Hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es &apos; Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek won the pu@@ ck and presented it to Max@@ im Tal@@ bot , who sc@@ ored between the circles .
A second before the first break , a home player , Patrick D@@ w@@ yer , nar@@ row@@ ed the lead in a power@@ -@@ play , but the beginning of the second part was led by Fl@@ yers again .
Speci@@ fically by Gi@@ rou@@ x .
After assist with J@@ á@@ g@@ r , he sc@@ ored the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a fourth goal by W@@ ay@@ ne Sim@@ mon@@ ds .
&quot; I love playing with him . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t ; want to say he &apos;s the best leag@@ ue player , but he &apos;s definitely among the best three , &quot; said J@@ á@@ g@@ r , complim@@ enting his center .
&quot; I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a ho@@ ck@@ ey player like him . &quot;
&quot; It makes me happy . &quot;
&quot; I want to assist him . &quot;
&quot; All those years in N@@ H@@ L , my te@@ am-@@ m@@ ates tried to assist me , and now its re@@ vers@@ ing , &quot; J@@ á@@ g@@ r added .
Carol@@ ina made the match more dramatic with Tu@@ omo Ru@@ ut@@ u and D@@ w@@ yer &apos;s goal from a penalty shot , making it a single goal difference .
Further complic@@ ations were avoided by Mat@@ t Read who increased the difference to two points .
&quot; P@@ ron@@ ger did great in our zone . &quot;
&quot; He po@@ ked out the pu@@ ck , I gained speed , and Read went on to the more distant pole . &quot;
&quot; I aimed at him , and I &apos;m glad it worked , &quot; Vor@@ á@@ č@@ ek described his view of the last goal of the match .
Its victory moved Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a onto the top of the Eastern Conference .
Czech Montreal def@@ ens@@ em@@ an , J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Š@@ pa@@ č@@ ek , did not finish the match with Buff@@ al@@ o ; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury .
Along with the experienced back , the Can@@ di@@ ens lost their two-@@ goal lead and lost 2 : 3 after a penalty sho@@ ot-@@ out .
Tom@@ á@@ š Ple@@ kan@@ ec failed to score on one of their ra@@ ids .
More than lost points , the home tra@@ iner was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defen@@ ders .
&quot; The situation is bad . &quot;
&quot; We finished the match with just one experienced player , the rest were young men . &quot;
&quot; However , there is nothing we can do about that , we just have to face it , &quot; Jacques Martin said .
&quot; Sub@@ stitution by sub@@ stitution , it was overwhelming and we couldn &apos;t resist . &quot;
&quot; We should have made the game simpler , moving the pu@@ ck out of our zone . &quot;
&quot; That was our weakness , &quot; a def@@ ender , P. K. Sub@@ ban added .
With thirty interventions , Czech go@@ al@@ ie , On@@ d@@ ř@@ e@@ j P@@ av@@ elec , helped Win@@ ni@@ pe@@ g &apos;s 5 : 2 victory over Tamp@@ a Bay .
J@@ ets &quot; goals , which interrupted a five-@@ match series of losses , were shared by five different sc@@ or@@ ers .
Development of Tri@@ p Prices Since 1989
Until 1989 , only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ akia : Č@@ ed@@ ok , Sport@@ ur@@ ist , C@@ K@@ M , Rek@@ rea , and Aut@@ ot@@ ur@@ ist .
As travelling to the West was strictly limited , travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries .
For their holiday , Czech tourists thus went to the sea to the German Democratic Republic ; Soviet Union ( So@@ chi , Cri@@ me@@ a near the Black Sea ) ; Bulgaria ; Romania ( both to the Black Sea ) ; and Hungary ( Bal@@ aton ) .
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 , when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia . Nevertheless , the Yugosla@@ vian regime turned West , which caused significant limitations to trips to Yugoslavia for Czech tourists .
A great parad@@ ox of the soci@@ alistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ aks too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .
If a Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak citizen wanted to travel , as an individual , to , for example , the Soviet Union or Poland , an invitation letter from the country was necessary ; otherwise , individual travel was impossible .
At the time , travel agencies would offer some trips to the West , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some &quot; good friends &quot; in the agency .
Still , that was not all .
A foreign currency assurance was essential for tra@@ vels to the West . It was not granted to politically un@@ reliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all .
Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak@@ ian currency was not freely con@@ verti@@ ble ; without the currency assurance , it was not possible to obtain financial means ( Western currency ) for travelling West .
Most often , Cz@@ ech@@ s spent their holiday at home , which resulted in great number of cot@@ tages and summer houses , a hab@@ it that survi@@ ves until now .
Since 1989 , Czech tourism thus experienced a real revolution .
While until 1989 , a holiday in the G@@ DR or Bulgaria was the cli@@ max of our tra@@ vels , last year , Cz@@ ech@@ s spent 4.@@ 5 million holidays in countries all over the world .
A great parad@@ ox we do not realise anymore is that until 1989 , we could not freely visit the currently most popular Croatia , as it was part of former Yugoslavia .
Right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements for neighbouring West European countries were cancelled . This started a huge wave of short-term visits of chi@@ ef@@ ly Vienna and Germany .
Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ aks could not get enough of travelling to the West . Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment .
For example , in Paris , Czech tours sle@@ pt in parks in t@@ ents , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension .
A typical feature of Czech tourism then was bringing their own food ( cans , sal@@ ami , etc . ) to save money .
Another important moment was the introduction of freely con@@ verti@@ ble Czech Cro@@ wn . After decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies .
Our living standards and average income were growing , which , around 1997 , resulted in another important moment .
Since 1997 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . Compar@@ ed to the past , air trips thus became un@@ believ@@ ably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts .
By the end of 1990s , Cz@@ ech@@ s did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries , except for the USA . This made our travelling even easier .
The next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000 . High demand resulted in the histor@@ ically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country , Thailand .
Since then , direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries . This winter , flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations .
Currently about 100 thousand Cz@@ ech@@ s visit exotic countries every year !
Yet another important event of this period , symboli@@ sing our development after the revolution , came in 2008 .
On November 17 , 2008 , the USA removed visa requirements for Czech tourists . Our country has thus permanently joined the world &apos;s most developed countries .
For the first time in history , in 2008 Cz@@ ech@@ s spent more than a half of their holidays abroad ( 5@@ 0.@@ 3 % ) ; and for the first time in history , they spent over 15 thousand Crow@@ ns per person per holiday abroad , including their costs at the destination .
General Meeting Should Find a President , M@@ ate Th@@ re@@ at Retur@@ ns
For nearly five months , Czech football has had no President . There exists a risk that I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek &apos;s successor , the head of Czech Republic &apos;s Foot@@ ball Association ( FA@@ Č@@ R ) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in N@@ ym@@ bur@@ k on Thursday .
There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow .
Without it , voting for the three candidates will not start .
J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta , and Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k are e@@ ager to lead Czech football .
Ha@@ š@@ ek resign@@ ed from his function in June . When leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .
However , Ha@@ š@@ ek &apos;s era sees football back in quar@@ rel@@ s between both association cham@@ bers , unable to agree on a common candidate .
This was fully shown on September 16 , when a new President was to be chosen .
General meeting deleg@@ ates wast@@ ed their trip to the National House in Prague , Sm@@ í@@ cho@@ v , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of att@@ or@@ ney .
This single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law , according to which representation based on power of att@@ or@@ ney is not possible .
Argum@@ ents concerning the election rules continue , though .
The Executive Board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly pre@@ occupied by this issue .
The view of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .
The question is : How to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid m@@ ate ?
&quot; The argument is based on whether to follow the by-@@ laws or to find another model , &quot; says one of the three FA@@ Č@@ R Vice-@@ Presidents , Du@@ š@@ an Sv@@ oboda , who represents professional football in the association &apos;s management .
Based on the model given by the by-@@ laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
Mor@@ avi@@ a is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both cham@@ bers win the election .
The Czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two-@@ third sup@@ eri@@ ority .
&quot; However , the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning ; that would completely deny the two-@@ chamber concept , &quot; Sv@@ oboda agrees with Mor@@ avi@@ a &apos;s arguments . He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations .
Some@@ what surpris@@ ingly Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by-@@ laws fits Pel@@ ta best of the candidates .
&apos;@@ I wish the elections follow the by-@@ laws to the maximum . &apos;
&quot; I want to avoid all kinds of representative non@@ sense , as at the previous general meeting , &quot; says the owner of Vi@@ kt@@ orie Pl@@ ze@@ ň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chi@@ ef@@ ly stood against Pel@@ ta .
Pel@@ ta remains an optim@@ ist .
He believes the new President will be known in N@@ ym@@ bur@@ k ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate construc@@ tively .
&quot; All passion@@ ate stir@@ ring will calm down with today &apos;s prosp@@ ective advance of the national team into the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; Foot@@ ball will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , &quot; a J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec func@@ tionary says . Of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l is more reserved .
&quot; I hope for an agreement , but the situation is very ambi@@ valent . &quot;
&quot; It is not between people from Boh@@ em@@ ia and Mor@@ avi@@ a , but there are attempts at pur@@ pos@@ eful adjustment of regulations . &quot;
&quot; That may cause another block@@ age of the general meeting . &quot;
&quot; I hope the common sense wins , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said .
There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .
Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro ; but who knows if the football gener@@ ality will be complete before the match .
An extra flight that was to take , among others , the Vice Presidents D@@ ali@@ bor Ku@@ č@@ era and Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l to Pod@@ gor@@ ica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure . An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the bar@@ ra@@ ged re@@ match .
Finally , a meeting at mini@@ stry level , said to happen on Wednesday , may decide .
Minister of Education , Youth , and Sports , Josef Do@@ be@@ š , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .
A lot is in the game : Government grants ; football tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess ; and the planned Č@@ S@@ TV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following S@@ az@@ ka &apos;s financial problems .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k En@@ ters the Presi@@ denti@@ al Fi@@ ght As He Can@@ not See a Su@@ itable Can@@ di@@ date
If , before the extraordinary general meeting , the Head of Pil@@ sen football players , Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , saw a strong candidate , who would meet all of his expectations of a new Foot@@ ball Association of the Czech Republic ( FA@@ Č@@ R ) President , he would not even apply for the top function .
&quot; If there was a good quality candidate , I &apos;d fight for him and not participate in the fight . &quot;
&quot; But no such person has currently been found , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said to Č@@ T@@ K .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k &apos;s motivation to join the fight with Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta and J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l is to try to prevent Pel@@ ta , report@@ edly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the FA@@ Č@@ R .
Moreover , P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k empha@@ sizes that should he win , he would only remain the President until 2013 , when a regular general meeting is scheduled .
In the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not exc@@ essively connected to football life .
&quot; I &apos;ve spoken to some people that could be considered . &quot;
&quot; I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they don &apos;t even want to identify themselves with Czech football . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to change this opinion , &quot; he said .
At the moment , P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k &apos;s strongest dis@@ agreement with Pel@@ ta is based on the latter &apos;s connection to Roman Ber@@ b@@ r , President of Pil@@ sen &apos;s regional football association . Ber@@ ber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lob@@ by@@ ist , capable of influ@@ encing the votes of general meeting deleg@@ ates .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k therefore finds it unacceptable for Pel@@ ta to become the President .
&quot; If he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ bin@@ ed with support from Ber@@ b@@ r , a capable business@@ man , this would be even more harmful for the football , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said .
He is hin@@ ting at the fact that some years ago , Pel@@ ta &apos;s name was recorded during phone t@@ apping in a corruption affair investigation ; Pel@@ ta came out without a sentence .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what pres@@ tige Pel@@ ta &apos;s victory would bring to football . &quot;
&quot; And how would we look in the eyes U@@ EFA and FIFA , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said . He is now more det@@ ached from his former statement saying he would &quot; sell the Pil@@ sen club if Pel@@ ta became President . &quot;
In case P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k wins on Thursday , he could imagine cooperation with Pel@@ ta in the future .
This opinion is shared by another candidate , Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , whom P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fi@@ as@@ co .
&quot; He ( Pel@@ ta ) would be the first one I &apos;d go to . &quot;
&apos;@@ He is very capable . &apos;
&quot; I can see him as the head of the representation . &quot;
&apos;@@ But he cannot manage the association . &apos;
&quot; I don &apos;t po@@ ke my nose in what I don &apos;t understand either , &apos; said P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , who gained a lot of attention in September , when he supported the removal of board of refer@@ ees , led by Lud@@ ě@@ k Mac@@ ela , replaced by D@@ ag@@ mar Dam@@ kov@@ á .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k claims he would dare to manage the association .
He refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the Pil@@ sen team that , with his support , celebrated its first leag@@ ue tri@@ umph in May .
&quot; I have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . &quot;
&quot; To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board , leading to dis@@ gu@@ sting situations , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k said . He does not hide his anti@@ pa@@ thy for , e.g. S@@ part@@ a &apos;s Director , Daniel K@@ ř@@ et@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý .
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FA@@ Č@@ R and the Czech Olympic Committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lot@@ tery tax .
&quot; That &apos;s one of the key things the new President should attend to . &quot;
&quot; If taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , I understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , &quot; he said .
P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k does not consider his connection with the Pil@@ sen club a burden , though he claims that an FA@@ Č@@ R President should be a non-@@ party one .
Pel@@ ta is connected to J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec , and Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l to Prague Du@@ kl@@ a .
&quot; It &apos;s not ideal . &quot;
&quot; Yet , I don &apos;t see a point in transferring my shares in the Pil@@ sen club hypo@@ cri@@ tically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , &quot; P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k says .
Pel@@ ta Pro@@ mis@@ ed New FA@@ Č@@ R Reg@@ ulations That Would A@@ void El@@ ection M@@ ate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the Presi@@ denti@@ al candidates , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new FA@@ Č@@ R regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .
Before the Thursday negotiations in N@@ ym@@ bur@@ k , a J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec func@@ tionary remains an optim@@ ist and believes that the pre-@@ election fight would be significantly sup@@ pressed by today &apos;s prosp@@ ective success of our football representation .
Pri@@ or to the failed election in September , Pel@@ ta promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment . A two-@@ month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .
&quot; People at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the President to be known on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; They feel it &apos;s high time someone leads the association , &quot; claims the man chi@@ ef@@ ly connected with the J@@ ab@@ lon@@ ec club ; but he spent many years in S@@ part@@ a and the association &apos;s executive board .
This gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage Czech football .
He believes current problems with elections are caused by the eu@@ ph@@ oria there was in the time of I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek &apos;s rei@@ gn .
&quot; Unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June . &quot;
&quot; If various represent@@ ations were not accepted , we would have had a President since September , &quot; Pel@@ ta said .
He appro@@ ached the re@@ writing of the key document of the civil association as a de@@ co@@ y for the deleg@@ ates .
&quot; If I become President , I will take it as my personal task , and I &apos;m willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . &quot;
&quot; It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , &quot; Pel@@ ta claims .
Other than that , he says he does not try to define himself against the ri@@ vals .
In the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his ri@@ val candidate should become his first Vice President .
For a long time , he did not attack Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , who has constantly criticised Pel@@ ta .
&quot; He &apos;s been in football for over a year , and gained some success . &quot;
&quot; However , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . &quot;
&quot; This is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , &quot; Pel@@ ta said about his ri@@ val . Pel@@ ta himself claims to be true to the proc@@ lam@@ ations he announced in September .
He sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football , from the lowest competitions to representation .
The representation should be the shopping window of football .
&quot; Í would also try to end all affairs , starting from the Boh@@ emi@@ ans case or the after@@ math of last year &apos;s corruption scandal . &quot;
&quot; Right after that , I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , &quot; the fort@@ y-@@ six year old candidate told Č@@ T@@ K two months ago .
He then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel hou@@ sec@@ le@@ aning .
&quot; I &apos;d need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . &quot; That was his message for Stra@@ ho@@ v , where the long period of inter@@ reg@@ n@@ um causes understandable ner@@ v@@ ousness .
Despite current catastro@@ phi@@ c scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on Thursday , the deleg@@ ates will not come to N@@ ym@@ bur@@ k in v@@ ain .
&quot; If the only question@@ able point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . &quot;
&quot; Foot@@ ball needs tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess it can only gain by finally having its leader , &quot; says Pel@@ ta , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a func@@ tionary , remains an optim@@ ist .
Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l Pro@@ mis@@ es That under H@@ im , the FA@@ Č@@ R Will Start Working H@@ ard
If , on Thursday &apos;s general meeting , J@@ ind@@ ř@@ ich Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l , the existing Vice President , is to become the President of Czech Foot@@ ball Association , many people in the Association would report@@ edly not be pleased .
Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .
He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas .
He also promised to solve the Boh@@ emi@@ ans case ; improve relations with both U@@ EFA and FIFA ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous President , I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek .
&quot; As President , I &apos;d like to focus on football as a whole . &quot;
&quot; From international contacts with U@@ EFA and FIFA , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . &quot;
&quot; By this , I don &apos;t mean I &apos;d do everything on my own , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said in his interview for Č@@ T@@ K .
&quot; I &apos;m a team player , and I want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . &quot;
&apos;@@ I &apos;ll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments , football makes big steps forward . &quot;
&quot; That would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just critici@@ zing of the work of others , &quot; he added .
Cri@@ tical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candi@@ dat@@ ure .
&quot; I &apos;m known to work 20 hours a day . &quot;
&quot; But I need to know if it has any sense ; and that I won &apos;t be surrounded by people thro@@ wing sti@@ cks under my feet and question my every move , &quot; he explained his hes@@ itation .
&quot; However , many people told me I mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t give up , otherwise others would follow . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s a trust I can &apos;t just throw away , &quot; he said .
Moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Ha@@ š@@ ek .
&quot; A great amount of work was done in those two years , and I don &apos;t want to throw it all away . &quot;
&quot; Proc@@ esses have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and I don &apos;t want someone else to stop them , &quot; he said , in fear that if the other candidate , Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pel@@ ta , is elected , situation f the Association might return to the period before Ha@@ š@@ ek .
&quot; I believe in systematic approach , which is something I don &apos;t think Mi@@ re@@ k Pel@@ ta is competent of . &quot;
&quot; He is chi@@ ef@@ ly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . &quot;
&quot; I can be bl@@ amed for many things , but certainly not for being subj@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; I try to be objective . &quot;
&quot; I want to make football for everyone , because then everyone has a good time , not just the chosen few , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said .
Furthermore , he re@@ fut@@ es the alleg@@ ations he would only be a Czech President .
&quot; Though some people try to claim the opposite , I plan to do the maximum for Mor@@ avi@@ a . &quot;
&quot; For example , it is high time to consider about split@@ ting the second leag@@ ue into Czech and Mor@@ avi@@ an parts , winners of which would continue into the first leag@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; This would prevent the current situation , where there are just three Mor@@ avi@@ an units in the leag@@ ue , which is a problem concerning young players in Mor@@ avi@@ a , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said .
As the Presi@@ denti@@ al fight has been joined by Pil@@ sen club Manager , Tom@@ á@@ š P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
&quot; Nevertheless , I can still feel a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me its Vice President , and can see I have achieved some clear successes , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said . Among his successes , he includes the saving of doz@@ ens of millions of Crow@@ ns on dis@@ advan@@ tage@@ ous contracts , negotiating TV contracts , and negotiations about the lot@@ tery law .
On the other hand , he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
While claiming that Pel@@ ta has been &apos; dis@@ qualified from returning tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess to Czech football &apos; , he considers the other ri@@ val , P@@ ac@@ l@@ í@@ k , a strong candidate that has things to offer .
&quot; No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pil@@ sen this year . &quot;
&quot; If he is elected , I hope he would continue in the things I@@ van Ha@@ š@@ ek started , without significant personnel changes in the committees . &quot;
&quot; He w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to tw@@ ist things for his own benefit , &quot; Ra@@ j@@ ch@@ l said about his ri@@ val .
Europe &apos;s most beautiful pools
Le@@ ap into the water
By Juli@@ a Stan@@ ek
P@@ add@@ ling pools with universal fi@@ bre op@@ tics and status pools in Budapest . Trav@@ ellers can experience Europe &apos;s incredible water - and relax tired lim@@ bs in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or a ram@@ ble .
One book can tell you where the water is at its best .
There was one thing Ir@@ is Me@@ der could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years : her swimming cost@@ ume .
L@@ ying back on the water , she has looked up at arti@@ s@@ tically designed dom@@ es , has sw@@ um towards marble cher@@ ub@@ s awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has mar@@ v@@ elled at me@@ ticul@@ ously restored art nou@@ veau swimming pools .
She rus@@ hed to add any pool she liked to her not@@ ebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building .
The architectural hist@@ orian Me@@ der looked at more than 200 swimming pools - and has now compiled here experiences in her recently published book Bade@@ freu@@ den ( The Jo@@ ys of Ba@@ thing ) , covering everything from public swimming baths in Munich to historical bathing pal@@ aces in the Black Forest and &quot; hard@@ core concrete buildings &quot; in Ta@@ un@@ us .
Her &quot; journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe &quot; took here through 13 countries . Besides Germany , Austria and Switzerland , she visited baths in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia .
The 4@@ 6-@@ year-old is a real bathing culture enthusi@@ ast .
She has very little enthusiasm for sport , says Me@@ der - but in the water , it &apos;s a different matter .
The only down@@ side is that fans of swimming have to cope with blue gla@@ zed tiles and the sten@@ ch of ch@@ lor@@ ine while j@@ og@@ gers can brea@@ the in the beg@@ u@@ iling sc@@ ent of spru@@ ce forests or listen to the bright twi@@ t@@ tering of birds in the park .
&quot; One day , I asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ug@@ ly , &quot; says Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based Me@@ der .
&quot; So I started collecting beautiful baths . &quot;
Water surface doub@@ les architecture
S@@ pl@@ ash@@ ing in the diving pool and e@@ there@@ al sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stim@@ ulated , according to Me@@ der .
And swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the buil@@ ders have gone to the trouble . &quot; You have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor . &quot;
&quot; The surface is very transparent , but also reflects the beauty of the entire building . &quot;
Everything is mir@@ r@@ ored vis@@ ually : high ceilings , colourful tiles and diving boards .
The illustr@@ ated po@@ ck@@ et@@ book The Jo@@ ys of Ba@@ thing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health o@@ ases over 190 pages - and makes you want to le@@ ap into the water .
Pool coll@@ ector Me@@ der discovered some notable examples during research in Hungary .
She found nit@@ rat@@ e-@@ rich water in a kar@@ st cave ( the Ca@@ ve Bath in Mis@@ kol@@ c@@ tap@@ ol@@ ca ) and a thermal bath filled with al@@ kal@@ ine water in a bott@@ le-@@ shaped building ( V@@ á@@ ro@@ si Ter@@ m@@ á@@ l@@ für@@ d@@ ö in J@@ á@@ sz@@ ber@@ é@@ ny ) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 10@@ 0-@@ year-old Sz@@ é@@ chen@@ y@@ i baths in Budapest .
Many of the heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria , on the other hand , offer spectacular views . You can view all of Zurich from a roof@@ top bath or look out on the snow@@ -@@ c@@ apped Ar@@ l@@ berg from an outdoor pool in St. An@@ ton . And there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski p@@ iste .
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bath@@ ers in Län@@ gen@@ feld . The Aqu@@ a D@@ ome in Ö@@ tz@@ tal looks like a U@@ F@@ O has just land@@ ed in the Alps .
It ste@@ ams during the winter from three open-@@ t@@ opp@@ ed sh@@ ells d@@ war@@ fed by the Ö@@ tz@@ tal mountains behind it .
Al@@ ham@@ bra in the Black Forest
Pool coll@@ ector Me@@ der was not gre@@ eted by the smell of ch@@ lor@@ ine in every swimming pool .
A lot of thermal baths smell of sul@@ ph@@ ur . The Á@@ r@@ p@@ á@@ d baths in B@@ é@@ k@@ esc@@ sab@@ a , Hungary , smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa .
The smell comes from the hydro@@ gen car@@ bon@@ ate in the al@@ kal@@ ine water . The water is almost black with si@@ lt that sti@@ cks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a particular kind .
Ir@@ is Me@@ der , however , was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places . When she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Lu@@ hat@@ scho@@ wi@@ tz , she found the area se@@ aled off .
The baths , designed by the architect Du@@ š@@ an Jur@@ ko@@ vic in 19@@ 02 , have been closed .
When Me@@ der looked through the we@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ be@@ aten windows of the red , white and yellow art nou@@ veau building , she could see we@@ eds growing up through the tiles .
One place where dec@@ ay has been stopped in its tracks is a magical swimming bath in the Black Forest - the Palais Ther@@ mal in Bad Wild@@ bad .
The baths have already gone through three stages of construction . You will not only discover neo-@@ Roman@@ esque elements from the period after it was built in 18@@ 44 , but also a Mo@@ or@@ ish hall in Al@@ ham@@ bra style added around 1900 .
Following its careful modernisation in 1995 , the Palais Ther@@ mal is the favourite swimming pool of pool con@@ nois@@ se@@ ur Ir@@ is Me@@ der - and not just because she comes from the Black Forest .
&quot; It is a real achievement to harmonise such different architectural styles so brilli@@ antly , &quot; says Me@@ der .
A di@@ p in the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly of secondary importance .
Agri@@ cultural commodities speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodity trading investigated
By Christian Te@@ ev@@ s
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural commodities ?
According to SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL ON@@ LIN@@ E , Josef A@@ cker@@ mann has given a working group the task of investig@@ ating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .
The CEO plans to make changes in January .
Hamburg -
For German citizens the situation is clear . According to one study , 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks spec@@ ulate on agricultural commodities such as whe@@ at and ma@@ ize .
Two thirds of those ques@@ tioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading deep@@ ens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .
The findings were made in a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute for Social Research and St@@ atis@@ tical Analy@@ sis on behalf of the consumer organisation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
The study is based on a report presented by F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch in mid-@@ October .
The author of the report , Har@@ ald Sch@@ um@@ ann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complic@@ it in global hunger .
The campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank , Josef A@@ cker@@ mann , although large banking houses such as Gold@@ man Sach@@ s and Morgan Stan@@ ley trade in the same way .
Origin@@ ally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting tra@@ ders against price fluctu@@ ations .
However , most experts now agree that the gam@@ bl@@ ers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are prof@@ iting at the expense of the poorest .
In contrast to US competitors , A@@ cker@@ mann has responded to the criticism . He has promised to investigate the accus@@ ations and has said that no trade is &quot; worth putting Deutsche Bank &apos;s good reputation at risk . &quot;
According to SP@@ I@@ EG@@ EL ON@@ LIN@@ E , an international working group is currently investig@@ ating the accus@@ ations contained in the F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch report .
The investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank &apos;s board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January .
Comm@@ odi@@ ties trading may be reduced or stopped completely .
A@@ cker@@ mann working on his image
The president of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , Th@@ il@@ o Bo@@ de , welcomed the news while emphas@@ ising his criticism of the financial sector . &quot; Bet@@ ting on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thou@@ ght@@ lessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . &quot;
As top bank lob@@ by@@ ist , A@@ cker@@ mann has a particular duty , according to Bo@@ de .
&quot; Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices , &quot; said Bo@@ de .
&quot; It does not matter whether this is about star@@ ving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank . &quot;
A@@ cker@@ mann &apos;s sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned .
Canc@@ elling con@@ ten@@ tious food commodity speculation could improve his image .
He also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome .
One in two people would withdraw commodities investments
F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch is stri@@ ving to keep up the pressure on the manager .
To date , more than 30@@ ,000 internet users have joined the organisation &apos;s campaign .
Bo@@ de published the survey on Tuesday . The survey was conducted for the For@@ sa Institute for Social Research and St@@ atis@@ tical Analy@@ sis on 7 and 8 November and 10@@ 01 people took part .
No more than el@@ even percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .
Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading . According to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .
2@@ 1@@ er Haus in Vienna
The reloc@@ ated pa@@ vi@@ lion
By In@@ geb@@ org Wi@@ en@@ sow@@ ski
An architectural history with high@@ s , lows and a happ@@ y-@@ ever-@@ after . Austria &apos;s Pavi@@ lion for the 1958 World &apos;s Fair in Brussels won prizes , became a museum in Vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
Now it is being re@@ opened as an exhibition centre .
Austria &apos;s pa@@ vi@@ lion , designed by Karl Schw@@ an@@ zer for the 1958 Brussels World &apos;s Fair , is a famous text@@ book example of modern post-@@ war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold stro@@ kes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .
Schw@@ an@@ zer &apos;s pa@@ vi@@ lion won the Grand Prix d &apos;@@ Archit@@ ecture in 1958 for its light flo@@ ating ste@@ el-@@ glass structure .
The building is considered a mil@@ estone in contemporary architecture .
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria &apos;s pa@@ vi@@ lion at the next world &apos;s fair .
He finally shot to f@@ ame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four-@@ cy@@ linder BMW Tower and its bow@@ l-@@ shaped sister building .
The pa@@ vi@@ lion , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was reloc@@ ated to the Schweizer Garten near Vienna &apos;s Süd@@ bahnhof , converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the &quot; 20@@ er Haus &quot; for this reason .
However , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spati@@ al reasons - it had no walls to hang art@@ works and poor air conditioning .
Nonetheless , it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home .
The building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
The architect Ad@@ olf Kris@@ chan@@ itz has now renovated the pa@@ vi@@ lion , which has been named the &quot; 2@@ 1@@ er Haus &quot; and will be used as a contemporary art museum .
The museum is a branch of the Bel@@ v@@ eder@@ e museum , which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
A@@ gn@@ es H@@ uss@@ l@@ ein@@ -@@ Ar@@ co who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Bel@@ v@@ eder@@ e in 2007 was instru@@ mental in the new beginning .
H@@ uss@@ l@@ ein@@ -@@ Ar@@ co , an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice sk@@ ater , who went on to So@@ th@@ eby &apos;s , the Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim Museum and to become the founding director of the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg , convinced politicians and conserv@@ ators to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private sponsor@@ ship and decided on the use of the building .
The new museum was to house the F@@ ritz W@@ ot@@ ru@@ ba Foundation &apos;s permanent collection , a café and a book@@ shop alongside contemporary art . An office building was also to be built .
Stri@@ ct supervision &amp; limited budget
Kris@@ chan@@ itz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project .
He was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded Joseph Ol@@ bri@@ ch &apos;s Sec@@ ession in Vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under Schw@@ an@@ zer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pa@@ vi@@ lion was an &quot; exceptionally important place &quot; for him where had visited exhibitions &quot; almost every weekend . &quot;
He knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already lost some of its gran@@ de@@ ur and ligh@@ tness when it was reloc@@ ated to Vienna and converted .
The problems facing the latest alter@@ ations were much greater . The building was &quot; an energy gu@@ zz@@ ler , &quot; says Kris@@ chan@@ itz .
The window profiles of the glass fac@@ ade were replaced , fi@@ b@@ reg@@ lass@@ -@@ reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by high-@@ grade safety glass .
Ther@@ mal bridge steel gir@@ ders were strengthened or replaced and as@@ best@@ os was removed from ceilings .
Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a sun@@ ken light well between the building and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate Schw@@ an@@ zer pa@@ vi@@ lion .
The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old re@@ d-@@ brown colour of ru@@ st-@@ proof@@ ing .
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be .
All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .
&quot; We often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority , &quot; says Kris@@ chan@@ itz , pointing to the rough flo@@ oring in the bas@@ ement .
The building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints , problems and conver@@ sions .
Kris@@ chan@@ itz stated recently that the pa@@ vi@@ lion &quot; from Brussels &quot; had been tough - a typical &quot; drop in the city &quot; story .
Archit@@ ecture like this is &quot; always in the wrong place &quot; and nonetheless wants to &quot; stimulate a real awareness . &quot;
The 2@@ 1@@ er Haus is very much in the right place , as there has been a stro@@ ke of luck in town planning . The completely re@@ designed &quot; main station quarter &quot; with offices and residential properties is developing around the Schweizer Garten .
There may also be a second stro@@ ke of luck . The 2@@ 1@@ er Haus may be bol@@ stered by another Kris@@ chan@@ itz building - the coll@@ ector Franc@@ es@@ ca von H@@ abs@@ burg has purchased the Tem@@ por@@ äre Kuns@@ th@@ alle Berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten .
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package into the millions
Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancell@@ ations in the winter .
The number of employees is to double .
The costs will run into the millions .
According to a newspaper report , Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million Euros more this year in the battle to prevent w@@ inter-@@ time cancell@@ ations and delays .
Ref@@ err@@ ing to an internal crisis plan at Deutsche Bahn , the Bild newspaper has reported that investment of around 300 million Euros in total is planned up to 2015 .
Investment is intended to improve the availability of lo@@ com@@ o@@ tives and the rail network , even in the face of extreme weather conditions .
The number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 16@@ ,000 .
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by start of business and 90 percent of the critical points within four to five hours .
Rü@@ diger Gru@@ be , head of Deutsche Bahn , warned of train cancell@@ ations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago .
Last winter , Deutsche Bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business , as it lack@@ ed reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions .
Num@@ erous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office .
There is also some delay in the delivery of ICE trains .
Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to have the ax@@ les of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently for many years , after an ICE train &apos;s ax@@ le broke in Cologne &apos;s main station .
Deutsche Bank pays multi-@@ million po@@ und fine in the USA
Fres@@ h trouble is following hard on the he@@ els of the u@@ pro@@ ar around Josef A@@ cker@@ mann , CEO of Deutsche Bank : Deutsche Bank faces a multi-@@ million po@@ und fine in the USA .
As if the problems at home were not already enough for Deutsche Bank , the industry giant &apos;s past in the USA is now also cat@@ ching up with it . Frankfur@@ t-@@ based Deutsche Bank will pay 14@@ 5 million dollars ( 10@@ 6 million Euros ) to settle disputes arising from the bank@@ rupt@@ cy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis .
The issue centres on the sale of mort@@ gage securities .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NC@@ U@@ A ) , a financial market regul@@ ator , acc@@ uses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mis@@ lead credit unions into buying the financial products .
The value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions .
&quot; We are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court , &quot; said a Deutsche Bank spo@@ kes@@ man in new York .
The bank did not admit culp@@ ability in the settlement .
The same is true of Ci@@ tig@@ ro@@ up , which agreed to pay 20.@@ 5 million dollars .
The NC@@ U@@ A chairman , Deb@@ b@@ ie Mat@@ z , welcomed the respon@@ si@@ veness of the two banks .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NC@@ U@@ A ) is responsible for the US credit unions and interven@@ es in bank@@ rupt@@ cies to protect customer deposits .
The NC@@ U@@ A is fighting for compensation for losses that run into the billions .
The current settlements are the first of their kind .
The regul@@ ator had also appro@@ ached other major banks and su@@ ed JP@@ Morgan Ch@@ ase , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in the summer .
The du@@ bi@@ ous mort@@ gage securities are so-called mort@@ ga@@ ge-@@ backed securities .
They are under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by home loans .
This se@@ aled the fate of a number of financial companies when the US property bub@@ ble explo@@ ded in 2007 .
The US investment bank , Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers , went bel@@ ly up in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis .
The banks batt@@ ling against a strong wind in the USA several years later .
Invest@@ ors and regul@@ ators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to pun@@ ish mis@@ conduct .
The Federal H@@ ous@@ ing Finance Agency ( F@@ H@@ F@@ A ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .
It acc@@ uses 18 major international banks of having taken in US len@@ ders F@@ ann@@ ie Ma@@ e and Fre@@ d@@ die Mac on mort@@ gage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars .
Deutsche Bank also faces legal action by the F@@ H@@ F@@ A covering multiple transactions with a total value of 14.@@ 2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007 .
The regul@@ ator is demanding that the Frankfur@@ t-@@ based bank take responsibility for &quot; substantial losses , &quot; but has not yet specified the exact sum .
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as bas@@ eless and has declared its intention to f@@ end off the claims .
War@@ ren Buff@@ ett pumps 10 billion into IBM
Financial gur@@ u Buff@@ ett is investing heavily in the IT company , IBM .
Since March , he has bought up shares tot@@ alling more than ten billion dollars .
Until now , the major American investor , War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , had always claimed not to invest in IT and comp@@ uting companies , as it was difficult to forecast the long-term development .
However , IBM &apos;s annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry .
According to Buff@@ ett , he should have realised much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies .
Investment by War@@ ren Buff@@ ett is considered a kni@@ gh@@ th@@ ood in the financial world .
The IT veter@@ an IBM has now earned the title of &quot; Sir IBM . &quot;
Buff@@ ett revealed that he had purchased IBM shares tot@@ alling 10.@@ 7 billion dollars since March on the US business news broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ BC .
His investment holding company , Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away , has become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.@@ 5 percent stake .
Buff@@ ett said that even IBM knew nothing of his involvement until recently .
He pra@@ ised the management , which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis .
&quot; They have done a great job , &quot; said Buff@@ ett , referring to the management strategy .
For a fairly long time , IBM has focused on lu@@ cr@@ ative IT services such as data centres .
The computer pione@@ er - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services , as well as powerful business computers .
Buff@@ ett had avoided technology firms to date .
He claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands
and invested in a freight railway , for example , a lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer .
His holding company , Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away , owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Co@@ ca@@ -@@ Col@@ a and Munich R@@ e ( formerly Mün@@ chen@@ er R@@ ück ) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries .
The 8@@ 1-@@ year-old took over the small textile company Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away in the 196@@ 0s and built it up , with cle@@ ver investments , into one of the most valuable companies in the world .
His lifestyle , however , has remained hum@@ ble ,
making him a cul@@ t figure for countless investors around the world .
His almost inf@@ alli@@ ble inst@@ inc@@ t for making money has earned him a nick@@ name as the &quot; Oracle from O@@ ma@@ ha . &quot;
The IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of Buff@@ ett &apos;s investment .
&quot; Big Blue , &quot; as IBM is also known , is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft .
Buff@@ ett , however , has said he is not planning to invest in Microsoft .
The founder , Bill Gates , is a close friend .
Im@@ min@@ ent danger
Following the discovery of the &quot; Z@@ wick@@ au cell , &quot; Turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in Germany .
One newspaper speaks of a &quot; bloo@@ dy ideology &quot; that is now res@@ ur@@ facing .
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek business@@ man between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist ideology .
Fe@@ ar and concern has been the reaction to this report in Turkey and within the German-@@ Turkish community in Germany .
For many German Tur@@ ks , the news brings back to life a long-@@ dead spec@@ tre . There has been no comparable right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist violence against Tur@@ ks since the ar@@ son attacks in Mö@@ ll@@ n in November 1992 and in Sol@@ ingen in May 1993 .
There was never any question , however , that xenophobia does exist in Germany .
The right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist network that has now been discovered , however , is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .
&quot; Is this a revi@@ val of the bloo@@ dy ideology ? &quot; was the head@@ line of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Hab@@ er@@ tur@@ k .
The Sab@@ ah newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpet@@ r@@ ators was a confidential inform@@ ant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be caught up in the right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist qu@@ ag@@ mire .
The Turkish Community of Germany ( T@@ G@@ D ) re@@ acted cal@@ mly , remember@@ ing the victims of ra@@ cial violence during a silent vi@@ gi@@ l in front of the Brand@@ enburg Gate at the weekend .
Just two weeks earlier , the Turkish Community in Berlin had commem@@ or@@ ated the fif@@ tieth anniversary of the German-@@ Turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians .
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story .
The coverage by some Turkish media has been like a sl@@ ap in the face . &quot; Germany &apos;s present on the fif@@ tieth anniversary &quot; is the title of one article on the H@@ aber X Turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of mur@@ ders .
The German edition of H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet also does not miss the chance to make this connection .
&quot; It is beginning to st@@ ink , &quot; is the title of the column by Ah@@ met Kü@@ l@@ ah@@ ci .
He points out that people have been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany &apos;s re@@ development with their work .
The behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful man@@ h@@ unt is heavily criticised on German-@@ Turkish internet forums .
The authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not think earlier to look for susp@@ ects in right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist circles .
Some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . &quot; If things continue to be done so c@@ ack@@ -@@ han@@ de@@ dly , migrants have no option but armed self-@@ defence . &quot;
&quot; That will be the best self-@@ defence . &quot;
&quot; Peace in Germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is un@@ covered and on the appropri@@ at@@ eness of punishment , &quot; writes &quot; Sel@@ en . &quot;
The attacks on Mö@@ ll@@ n and Sol@@ ingen in the 9@@ 0s are an example of what it means for peace in Germany to be at risk .
The photo of the bur@@ nt out ru@@ in of Sol@@ ingen is deeply eng@@ ra@@ ined in German and Turkish memory .
No other event has shown the Tur@@ ks living here more clearly that there is im@@ min@@ ent danger and shown the Germans that mi@@ str@@ ust and distance can cul@@ min@@ ate in real violence .
The attacks , however , increased the sense of Turkish unity .
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time compl@@ ained mainly of the failure of German policy following the attacks . Hel@@ mut Koh@@ l dec@@ lined to visit the survi@@ vors in Mö@@ ll@@ n .
He sent a tel@@ eg@@ ram of c@@ ommis@@ er@@ ation to the Turkish president after the ar@@ son attack in Sol@@ ingen , but it was his foreign minister , Klaus Kin@@ kel , who took his place at the mem@@ orial ceremony in Cologne - Kin@@ kel summ@@ ed up in his speech the taxes Tur@@ ks contribute in Germany ,
just as if he were calcul@@ ating the value of a person by the taxes he pays .
The coverage by the Turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mi@@ str@@ ust of many German Tur@@ ks in the current German state has become since .
Stra@@ i@@ ght talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to identify and re@@ assess right-@@ wing extrem@@ ist terrorism in Germany .
The Lake Zurich banking scandal
The most ris@@ k-@@ taking bank in Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland .
U@@ BS almost went bank@@ rupt during the financial crisis and has been stru@@ ggling from one crisis to the next ever since .
A German is now to bring it back in line .
A@@ xel Weber certainly had not imag@@ ined that would be his role .
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Federal bank , it was announced in July that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013 : Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank U@@ BS - an unexpected and lu@@ cr@@ ative career move .
A@@ xel Weber was clearly delighted , pra@@ ising Switzerland for its beauty and U@@ BS for its newly won soli@@ dity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues .
&quot; U@@ BS has managed to turn around . &quot;
&quot; I am looking forward to working with K@@ asp@@ ar V@@ illi@@ ger and Os@@ wald Grü@@ bel . &quot;
But by September it was already clear that everything would be very different .
A U@@ BS tra@@ der in London had b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed all the bank &apos;s security systems and g@@ amb@@ led away around 1.@@ 7 billion Euros .
U@@ BS CEO , Os@@ wald Grü@@ bel - a ban@@ ker not only famous in Switzerland - had to go .
The U@@ BS Chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking : when will A@@ xel Weber finally arrive ?
Weber is to advise the bank from February 2012 .
And he will take on the role of Chairman of the Board in May , and not in 2013 , the bank announced on Tuesday .
That will be tough for A@@ xel Weber .
He is an economics professor and central ban@@ ker , not a conventional ban@@ ker , and clearly would need some time to adjust .
All at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deser@@ ved the title of &quot; Europe &apos;s biggest banking scandal . &quot;
U@@ BS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been stru@@ ggling from one scandal to the next for years .
The proud Swiss bank , it seems , is to be spar@@ ed nothing .
It began in the financial crisis .
U@@ BS had an excellent reputation until 2007 .
The bank combined the image of the sec@@ re@@ tive and solid , but equally sav@@ vy asset manager with ambitious targets , aiming to become a major player in investment banking .
As a result , in 2007 U@@ BS was managing 1.@@ 6 billion , thereby managing more more money from weal@@ thy clients than any other bank in the world ,
and had risen to the leag@@ ue of the world &apos;s biggest banks as an investment bank .
That made an impression .
The former ban@@ ker and long-@@ standing banking professor at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich , Hans Gei@@ ger , explains : &quot; I always presented U@@ BS to my students as the model of a good bank . &quot;
&quot; From what we know today , you have to ask how I could be so wrong . &quot;
He was very wrong indeed .
It only became clear in 2007 that something was really going very wrong at U@@ BS .
In the middle of the year , CEO Peter Wu@@ ff@@ li - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant ban@@ ker - suddenly step@@ ped down .
Some months later we could gu@@ ess at why he had left .
The investment division of the bank had g@@ amb@@ led on sub@@ prime securities and was forced to write off billions .
U@@ BS announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 13 billion Swiss fran@@ cs to face the crisis .
The bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many ban@@ kers would have resp@@ ect@@ fully dec@@ lined a short while earlier - a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab@@ ic sovereign wealth fund that was so sec@@ re@@ tive , even its name was not disclos@@ ed .
That was just the first blow .
It got a lot worse in April 2008 .
The bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors , Mar@@ cel O@@ sp@@ el - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resign@@ ed .
Cat@@ astro@@ phe followed in October 2008 . U@@ BS faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state .
The National Bank bought up toxic securities from U@@ BS for unt@@ old billions and the Swiss Con@@ federation paid six billion Swiss fran@@ cs for a mandatory con@@ verti@@ ble bond to become part owner of the bank .
The whole of Switzerland was sho@@ cked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .
After all , the balance sheet total for U@@ BS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland ( see chart ) .
&quot; We would not be able to save the U@@ BS for a second time , &quot; says banking resear@@ cher Gei@@ ger .
The second catastro@@ phe followed closely on the he@@ els of the first .
A few months later , U@@ BS capit@@ ulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of weal@@ thy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank .
U@@ BS also agreed to pay 7@@ 80 million dollars consisting of re@@ payment of un@@ justified profits from the business and a penalty .
U@@ BS therefore more or less admitted having been an access@@ ory to tax ev@@ asion .
At the same time , U@@ BS lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fo@@ g of sec@@ rec@@ y .
Swiss banking sec@@ rec@@ y was not the same after the scandal .
The CEO and the Chairman then resign@@ ed and
the exo@@ dus of client money began .
The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by ai@@ ding and ab@@ et@@ ting tax ev@@ asion .
And just as things had cal@@ med down and U@@ BS looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous ro@@ gue tra@@ der . A single tra@@ der g@@ amb@@ led away 1.@@ 7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong .
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
&quot; The Ad@@ obo@@ li incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little , &quot; says Martin Jan@@ ssen , economic and professor of finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich .
The CF@@ O of one major German bank also has no doubts : &quot; The problem facing U@@ BS is that it does not having a handle on risk control . &quot;
It was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made Swiss ban@@ kers the guar@@ di@@ ans of the world &apos;s major assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine re@@ public or not .
The saf@@ es of Swiss banks had become a symbol of uns@@ ha@@ ke@@ able reliability , just as Lin@@ dt and Sp@@ rün@@ gli had come to symboli@@ se sophisticated chocolate .
The U@@ BS headquarters in Zurich still fit the c@@ lich@@ é of the dig@@ ni@@ fied Swiss private bank - just a bit bigger .
The location alone is classic .
The bank has its head office on Zurich &apos;s Bahn@@ hof@@ strasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake , surrounded by the snow@@ -@@ c@@ apped peaks of the Swiss mountains .
The buildings are ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous and the shop rates are among the highest in Europe .
Je@@ well@@ ers such as Ti@@ ff@@ any &apos;s are to be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli .
The Swiss banks have resi@@ ded here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Su@@ isse and elite private banks such as Juli@@ us B@@ är .
A heavy revol@@ ving door opens onto the U@@ BS reception .
The walls within are cla@@ d in marble behind vast leather arm@@ chairs . There is a large sign to the &quot; Safe &quot; next to the bank &apos;s logo .
U@@ BS knows that its clients are looking for - security .
But both the major Swiss banks , U@@ BS and Credit Su@@ isse , at some point ou@@ sted the Swiss banking concept - or betra@@ yed it , as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes .
He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too , like all Swiss ban@@ kers , does business with the two major banks .
He believes U@@ BS has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the Ang@@ lo@@ -S@@ ax@@ ons are also very active .
In his opinion , the Swiss have nothing to add .
&quot; And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Ang@@ lo@@ -S@@ ax@@ ons long ago . &quot;
It was in fact Ang@@ lo@@ -S@@ ax@@ on investment banking that changed U@@ BS , brought in its first big profits - and then the deb@@ ac@@ le . No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub@@ prime jung@@ le as the major Swiss bank .
The catastro@@ phe became evident on 15 October 2008 .
&quot; That Wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million under@@ took the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation , &quot; writes author Lu@@ kas Hä@@ ssig in his book The U@@ BS C@@ ras@@ h .
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss fran@@ cs ( around 45 billion Euros ) to save the bank from bank@@ rupt@@ cy .
How could it have come to that ?
Tal@@ king to Swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of U@@ BS .
Two of the three major Swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in June 1998 .
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the mer@@ ger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .
The fact that the two banks that went to form U@@ BS compl@@ emented each other helped . One was a weal@@ thy but sed@@ ate bank speci@@ alising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less weal@@ thy , but much more internation@@ alised .
The internation@@ alised investment ban@@ kers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an al@@ mi@@ ghty wheel .
Two names are connected with the rise of U@@ BS : Peter Wu@@ ff@@ li , Group CEO of U@@ BS from 2001 to 2007 , and Mar@@ cel O@@ sp@@ el , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
&quot; I always thought that Wu@@ ff@@ li and O@@ sp@@ el were a dream team , &quot; says the banking research , Hans Gei@@ ger .
&quot; Wu@@ ff@@ li , highly intellectual , modest , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and O@@ sp@@ el , with gut inst@@ inc@@ t who had worked his way up from being a ban@@ ker &apos;s app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce . &quot;
But O@@ sp@@ el in the end reli@@ ed on Wu@@ ff@@ li .
And Wu@@ ff@@ li ultimately may have made a critical error . &quot; He thought his models were reality , &quot; says Gei@@ ger .
&quot; That is tragic . &quot;
Trag@@ ic it may be .
Pri@@ de comes before a fall .
Emp@@ lo@@ yees of U@@ BS clearly remember the management meetings where CEO Wu@@ ff@@ li always repeated the same s@@ logan - de@@ thr@@ one Gold@@ man Sach@@ s .
The American bank was the world &apos;s most powerful investment bank .
It led the &quot; leag@@ ue tables &quot; that documented the success of the banks at that time .
U@@ BS wanted to get to the very top of the leag@@ ue .
It managed some of the way .
U@@ BS was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .
Commission@@ ed management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . In terms of what in banking termin@@ ology is referred to as &quot; fixed income , &quot; U@@ BS was far behind the very largest banks .
U@@ BS had gaps in its US mort@@ gage products .
To plug the hole , U@@ BS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence .
Hung@@ ry for growth , the bank itself and a h@@ edge fund founded by the bank invested in US sub@@ prime securities .
It developed into a vast machine that pack@@ aged up securities based on US mort@@ gage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , U@@ BS carried on .
&quot; U@@ BS was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the US housing market was in fl@@ ames , &quot; says banking expert Gei@@ ger .
The greater the rise , the greater the fall .
One manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .
Po@@ sts at U@@ BS became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day .
Any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job .
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .
Banking expert Gei@@ ger already has an idea - qu@@ it investment banking , focus on asset management and turn back to Swiss roots .
The bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
It is clear , nonetheless , that investment banking must shr@@ ink significantly .
The new head of the bank , Ser@@ gio Er@@ mot@@ ti , plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday .
The 5@@ 1-@@ year-old Ital@@ o@@ -S@@ wis@@ s ban@@ ker was actually only imag@@ ined as a transitional solution when the bank par@@ ted ways un@@ expect@@ edly with his predecessor Grü@@ bel .
Since then , he has proved his m@@ ett@@ le and is now to head U@@ BS permanently , the Z@@ uri@@ ch-@@ based bank announced on Tuesday .
Er@@ mot@@ ti plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-@@ 9@@ 0s .
He is cutting 3@@ 500 jobs .
But that will not be enough .
U@@ BS needs a vision .
What is U@@ BS ?
How does it plan to make money ?
Those are the questions A@@ xel Weber is definitely already asking himself .
Pub@@ lic@@ ly , he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in Zurich .
Next year .
Fe@@ ar of recession in Europe de@@ pres@@ ses US stock exchange
The imp@@ ending recession in Europe has de@@ pressed the mood of US investors at the start of the week .
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little impact .
Cur@@ bed industrial production on the continent ni@@ pped hopes that the debt crisis might stabili@@ se in the bu@@ d .
The general relief following the change of government in Rome and Athens was not sustained .
The Euro fell against the dollar .
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week , not half empty - now the problems are coming to the fore once again , said Mark Lu@@ sch@@ ini of Jan@@ ney Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery Scott .
Financial stocks in particular were on the sales recei@@ pts .
The D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage closed business at 12@@ ,@@ 0@@ 78 with a fall of 0.@@ 6 percent .
The market bar@@ ometer fluctu@@ ated between 12@@ ,@@ 0@@ 27 and 12@@ ,@@ 170 points in the course of trading .
The broader S &amp; P 500 index closed at 12@@ 51 point , down one percent .
The Nas@@ da@@ q Technology Index lost 0.@@ 8 percent and closed trading at 26@@ 57 points .
In Frankfurt , the Da@@ x fell 1.2 percent closing at 5@@ 9@@ 85 points .
Industry in the 17 Euro countries has significantly reduced production and is adju@@ sting to the end of the up@@ turn .
The Eurostat statistics office announced that , in September , companies produced two percent less than in the previous month .
The announcement made US investors scep@@ tical . &quot; We are not an island . We are dependent , &quot; said Steve Gold@@ man of Gold@@ man Management .
He also claimed that Europe is not likely to sha@@ ke off a recession quickly and that there are further signs of weakness in the banks .
The investment legend , War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , could only support such caution . In a CN@@ BC interview , he said that it was not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis .
In his opinion , it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks .
Instead , Buff@@ ett thre@@ w a dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ old principle out of the window to invest in the US technology industry .
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boo@@ sted the veter@@ an company &apos;s share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading .
The shares closed almost un@@ changed at 18@@ 7.@@ 35 dollars .
Buff@@ ett claims to have paid 170 dollars on average per share and now has a 5.@@ 5 percent stake .
The share price of his investment company Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away fell 1.3 percent .
Bank of America share certificates fell significantly more strongly than the market by 2.@@ 6 percent .
The bank is conver@@ ting almost all its remaining shares in the China Con@@ struction Bank into cash , bringing in 6.@@ 6 billion dollars .
The bank primarily plans to bol@@ ster its capital quota with the net profit from the sale to meet tou@@ gher regulations .

Intelli@@ gent cro@@ ws are spreading in cities
R@@ ooks are considered problem birds in many places . Exper@@ ts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities .
Some like the birds , others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible . Cro@@ ws have been part of the cit@@ y@@ scape for hundreds of years , but residents compl@@ aining about the fil@@ th and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities .
A solution to the problem birds , however , is far from within reach .
Exper@@ ts at the first cro@@ w sym@@ posi@@ um in the East Fris@@ ian town of Le@@ er have said that ro@@ o@@ ks can no longer be forced out of cities .
Speci@@ alists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions .
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Conserv@@ ation@@ ists stated that migration of specially protected ro@@ o@@ ks was the root of the problem in cities , pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habit@@ ats .
H@@ unting , increasing development and f@@ elling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the birds .
Cro@@ ws are protected .
There are large colon@@ ies with more than 600 breeding p@@ airs in the West@@ phal@@ ian town of So@@ est and in the north-@@ west in J@@ ever , Di@@ ep@@ holz , Ach@@ im bei Bremen and Le@@ er .
A controversial project to cul@@ l cro@@ ws in Le@@ er was behind negative head@@ lines in 2005 .
Cri@@ tics described the capture of the birds in bird tra@@ ps and how they were be@@ aten to death with clubs as particularly brutal .
&quot; Nor@@ mal displac@@ ement and det@@ err@@ ence does nothing , &quot; said town and country plann@@ er Werner Kl@@ ö@@ ver from Le@@ er .
Spra@@ ying off n@@ ests with water or f@@ elling trees often has undes@@ ired consequences , said environment expert Man@@ fred Kaiser from L@@ ahr in Bad@@ en-@@ Wür@@ tt@@ emberg .
&quot; The animals disp@@ er@@ se and large colon@@ ies split up and spread to other areas . &quot;
Det@@ err@@ ence would only be concei@@ vable as an exception in hospitals , retirement homes and schools .
&quot; We have to live with them . Get@@ ting rid of them is not an option . &quot;
Without the surrounding area , the problem in the cities will not be solved , said Le@@ er &apos;s may@@ or , Wolfgang Kell@@ ner .
A combination of det@@ err@@ ing birds from sensitive residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option .
&quot; Information boards instead of chain sa@@ ws &quot; was the s@@ logan proposed by the psych@@ ologist and eth@@ n@@ ologist U@@ ta Maria Jür@@ gens , who argued for a totally different approach to the birds . &quot; We should have the self-@@ confidence to live with this problem . &quot;
Jür@@ gens was a co-@@ founder of the A@@ scher@@ berg cro@@ w educational trail in Schl@@ es@@ wi@@ g-@@ Hol@@ stein , where notice boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent ro@@ ok .
The project is already attrac@@ ting interest from tourists .
Jür@@ gens also expressed her opinion on the criticism of the noise the birds make . &quot; The noise conve@@ ys a lot of information . They have a lot to say to each other . &quot;
The intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary . R@@ ooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice mor@@ sel , but create tools themselves .
Beh@@ avi@@ our@@ al researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the extent of the birds &quot; intelligence on four ro@@ o@@ ks .
In one experiment , the birds quickly learnt that they had to kno@@ ck over a platform to get to a mo@@ th lar@@ va .
They recognised the size and shape of stone needed to collapse the platform without much training .
In a second experiment , the c@@ ann@@ y cro@@ ws had to solve a tri@@ ck@@ ier problem .
The researchers put a small bu@@ cket with a mo@@ th lar@@ va in a vertical cy@@ linder .
The birds could not reach their pre@@ y with their be@@ aks .
However , the researchers had provided pieces of wire .
All four birds used the wire to form a h@@ ook and used the h@@ ook to fish the bu@@ cket out of the tube by its handle .
Three of the four ro@@ o@@ ks even managed it at the first attempt .
Ron@@ al@@ do ro@@ ckets Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosni@@ ans and Tur@@ ks for a last minute win were short-@@ lived .
The favour@@ ites Portugal , Croatia and the Czech Republic , plus Ireland , will be at the 2012 European champ@@ ionship .
Portugal , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Ireland have got the final spots for the Euro 2012 champ@@ ionship in Poland and Ukraine .
L@@ ed by super@@ star Cris@@ ti@@ ano Ron@@ al@@ do who sc@@ ored in the 8th and 5@@ 3rd minutes , Portugal beat Bosni@@ a-@@ Herzegovina 6 : 2 ( 2 : 1 ) , round@@ ing off their fifth Euro appearance perfectly after 0 : 0 in the first leg .
The Cz@@ ech@@ s only needed 1 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) in the play@@ off second leg against out@@ si@@ der Montenegro after a clear win in the first leg ( 2 : 0 ) .
Croatia did not miss a tri@@ ck with 0 : 0 against Turkey and Ireland managed an easy 1 : 1 ( 1 : 0 ) against Estonia .
N@@ ani ( 24@@ th minute ) , Hel@@ der Pos@@ tig@@ a ( 7@@ 2nd and 8@@ 2nd ) and Miguel Vel@@ o@@ so ( 80@@ th ) sc@@ ored the other goals for Portugal .
The former Wol@@ fs@@ burg Bundes@@ lig@@ a professional Z@@ v@@ je@@ z@@ dan Mis@@ im@@ ovi@@ c and cap@@ tain E@@ mir Sp@@ a@@ hi@@ c ev@@ ened the score with a converted 4@@ 1@@ st-@@ minute penalty and a goal in the 6@@ 5th for Bosnia .
S@@ ena Lu@@ lic got a second yellow card in the 5@@ 4th minute .
Bosnia had already been kno@@ cked out of the World Cup 2010 play@@ off@@ s in South Africa against Portugal .
Portugal got off to a perfect start in Lisbon &apos;s E@@ sta@@ dio da Lu@@ z .
Ron@@ al@@ do po@@ unded a free k@@ ick into the nets from about 30 meters to take an early lead .
A good quarter of an hour later , N@@ ani displayed his long-@@ range abilities , raising the lead to 2 : 0 from the 25 met@@ re line .
The Bosni@@ ans , with no opening in the first half hour , had their first opportunity with goal sc@@ orer Edi@@ n D@@ z@@ ek@@ o .
The former Wol@@ fs@@ burg player from the English champ@@ ionship leader Manchester City put a he@@ ader onto the bottom edge of the cross@@ bar in the 3@@ 3rd minute , but the ball did not go over the goal line .
Ji@@ rac@@ ek scores for the Czech Republic
The refer@@ ee Wolfgang Star@@ k from Er@@ gol@@ ding then gar@@ n@@ ered some attention .
Following an attack on Hel@@ der Pos@@ tig@@ a in the Bosni@@ an penalty area in the 36@@ th minute , Star@@ k decided the Portuguese player had simul@@ ated and gave him a yellow card .
Star@@ k also awarded a controversial penalty for hand@@ ball after a f@@ oul by Fab@@ io Co@@ ent@@ ra@@ o - Mis@@ im@@ ovi@@ c converted .
After half-@@ time , the vic@@ e-@@ European champ@@ ions of 2004 settled the score with four more goals .
Pet@@ r Ji@@ rac@@ ek clear@@ ed up any remaining doubt for the Cz@@ ech@@ s in the 8@@ 1st minute .
The European champ@@ ions of 1976 are going to the Euro Championship for the fifth time in a row .
Lu@@ ck also sm@@ iled on tra@@ iner Mich@@ al Bi@@ le@@ k &apos;s team and Bundes@@ lig@@ a leg@@ ion@@ aries Michael K@@ ad@@ l@@ ec ( Bay@@ er L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en ) and T@@ omas Pek@@ hart ( 1st FC Nur@@ emberg ) with a potentially catastro@@ phi@@ c error early on .
Go@@ al@@ ie Pet@@ r C@@ ech prevented a potential own goal from T@@ omas Si@@ vo@@ k in the 9th minute with a sp@@ li@@ t-@@ second ref@@ lex .
Montenegro had its best opportunities when the St@@ ev@@ an Jo@@ ve@@ tic and De@@ jan Dam@@ jan@@ ovi@@ c du@@ o were on the field .
Dam@@ jan@@ ovi@@ c took a shot from the edge of the penalty area that just missed C@@ ech &apos;s goal in the 40@@ th minute .
After half-@@ time , the cross@@ bar saved the Cz@@ ech@@ s &quot; already batter@@ ed world-@@ class go@@ al@@ ie after the forward from FC Se@@ oul re@@ treated in the 50@@ th minute .
The winning goal was sc@@ ored just before full-@@ time .
Turkey , mean@@ while , was lacking football geni@@ us in Zagreb .
Four days after losing 0 : 3 in Istanbul , the Tur@@ ks could do no better than a 0 : 0 draw in Zagreb .
While it is now virtually a certainty that national tra@@ iner Gu@@ us Hi@@ dd@@ ink must now give up his place on the ben@@ ch of the team that reached third place in 2002 , the Croati@@ ans are through to the final round of a European champ@@ ionship for the fourth time .
The Tur@@ ks almost managed the perfect start in front of 3@@ 1,000 spec@@ t@@ ators at the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium .
Sel@@ cu@@ k In@@ an &apos;s long-@@ range shot hit the post in the s@@ eventh minute and stri@@ ker Kaz@@ im Kaz@@ im was unable to put the re@@ bound into the net .
Croatia then wo@@ ke up , taking more and more control of the game .
The Croati@@ ans continued in fine form after half-@@ time .
The Bu@@ des@@ lig@@ a leg@@ ion@@ aries D@@ ani@@ j@@ el P@@ ran@@ j@@ ic ( Bayern Munich ) and Gord@@ on Schil@@ den@@ feld ( Ein@@ tra@@ cht Frankfurt ) were on the field alongside Mario Mand@@ zu@@ k@@ ic from V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , who made space for I@@ van Per@@ is@@ ic from Dor@@ t@@ mund from the 6@@ 2nd minute .
T@@ rap@@ att@@ oni going to Euro 2012
The Irish in Dublin were celebr@@ ating their first appearance at the European champ@@ ionship since 1988 in Germany .
Trainer Giovanni T@@ rap@@ att@@ oni &apos;s team - already looking assured of a place following the 4 : 0 victory in the first leg - took the lead in the 3@@ 2nd minute thanks to a goal from Stephen W@@ ard .
Kon@@ stanti@@ n V@@ assi@@ lj@@ ev equ@@ alised for the away team in the 5@@ 7th minute .
Ireland kept up the pace , but had to wait until the 23@@ rd minute when Rob@@ b@@ ie Ke@@ ane from Los Angeles had the first clean shot on goal .
The Est@@ onian re@@ argu@@ ard prevented him at the last moment from taking Ireland into the lead .
The goal came in the 3@@ 2nd minute .
After a failed defence by go@@ al@@ ie P@@ av@@ el Lon@@ dak , W@@ ard was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to bring the score to 1 : 0 .

M@@ ass S@@ lau@@ ghter on a Personal Level
Peter En@@ gl@@ und &apos;s intense and bi@@ gh@@ ear@@ ted new book , &quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row : An In@@ tim@@ ate History of the First World War , &quot; begins with a long dram@@ ati@@ s person@@ ae of the sort that can make your heart s@@ ink .
Here is advice for proceed@@ ing : G@@ ently exc@@ ise this page and make it your book@@ mark .
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. En@@ gl@@ und &apos;s no@@ vel@@ istic telling , and this dram@@ ati@@ s person@@ ae will function as your GPS , a be@@ acon during those few moments when , like one of his men and women , you are confused and ber@@ eft in the fo@@ g of war .
Mr. En@@ gl@@ und is a Swedish hist@@ orian and journalist .
He is also the new permanent secret@@ ary of the Swedish Academy , which awards the Nobel Prize in Liter@@ ature .
What he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not in@@ accurately , as &quot; a work of anti-@@ history . &quot;
It contains few big names , major treaties or famous batt@@ les ; there are almost no amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , d@@ ash@@ ing journalists or discussions of tac@@ tics and materi@@ el .
It &apos;s not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as &quot; a book about what it was like . &quot; It &apos;s about &quot; feelings , impres@@ sions , experiences and mo@@ o@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row &quot; th@@ reads together the war@@ time experiences of 20 more or less un@@ remarkable men and women , on both sides of the war , from school@@ girls and bot@@ an@@ ists to mountain clim@@ bers , doctors , am@@ bul@@ ance drivers and c@@ ler@@ ks .
A few of these people will become her@@ oes .
A few will become prisoners of war , or lose lim@@ bs , go mad or die .
Their lives fli@@ cker here like vo@@ tive cand@@ les ligh@@ ted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some w@@ ink out .
Mr. En@@ gl@@ und &apos;s book is a devi@@ ation from standard history books .
It is a correc@@ tive too to the notion that World War I was only about the di@@ re tr@@ en@@ ch war@@ fare on the Western Front .
&quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row &quot; exper@@ tly p@@ ans across other theat@@ ers of war : the Alps , the Balkans , the Eastern Front , Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , East Africa .
Sol@@ di@@ ers in this book have be@@ eh@@ i@@ ves fall on them ; one has Christmas in Egypt under the p@@ yr@@ am@@ ids ; ts@@ et@@ se fli@@ es are an in@@ trac@@ table problem .
This is a moving book , almost from the start .
War floods these people &apos;s lives like a natural catastro@@ phe , a Hur@@ ri@@ cane Kat@@ rin@@ a that re@@ eks of cor@@ di@@ te .
When c@@ ann@@ on fire is heard in the distance , and you are a woman at home with your children , do you stay or fle@@ e ?
Who is coming , anyway ?
Almost no one understands what &apos;s happening , even why this war is to be fought .
&quot; L@@ ack of facts , &quot; Mr. En@@ gl@@ und ob@@ serves , &quot; has been p@@ added out with gu@@ esses , sup@@ positions , hopes , fears , id@@ ées fixes , con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ ories , dreams , night@@ mar@@ es and rum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; The Beauty and the Sor@@ row &quot; follows individuals like Florence Far@@ m@@ bor@@ ough , an English nur@@ se in the Russian Army , and Richard St@@ ump@@ f , a young German high-@@ seas fleet seam@@ an .
Their stories are mostly taken from mem@@ o@@ irs , letters and other already published material .
The accounts of their lives can be ter@@ rif@@ ying or stir@@ ring , but are most fully alive in Mr. En@@ gl@@ und &apos;s accum@@ ulation of small moments , stra@@ y details .
Many of these are about de@@ priv@@ ation and making do .
In telling a German school@@ girl &apos;s story he says : &quot; Ersatz , everywhere er@@ satz . &quot;
&quot; Sub@@ stitute coffee , f@@ ake al@@ umin@@ um , im@@ itation rubber , paper band@@ ages , wooden buttons . &quot;
He goes on about the er@@ satz food in Germany .
He describes &quot; meat made of pressed rice bo@@ iled in mut@@ ton fat ( and finished off with a f@@ ake bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dri@@ ed roots and dri@@ ed pot@@ ato pe@@ el ; shoes sol@@ ed with wood . &quot;
There are , he notes , &quot; 8@@ 37 registered meat sub@@ stitutes per@@ missible in the production of s@@ aus@@ ages , 5@@ 11 registered coffee sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
Some stories are about honor and bra@@ very .
One American recogni@@ zes his own impul@@ se toward sav@@ ag@@ ery and declar@@ es about war : &quot; You feel that , after all , this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigar@@ ette and wh@@ is@@ key , the evening paper or the best seller , and to pre@@ tend that such a vene@@ er means civili@@ zation and that there is no bar@@ b@@ arian behind your star@@ ched and stu@@ d@@ ded shirt front . &quot;
Conver@@ sely a British soldi@@ er re@@ alizes that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
&quot; Once one is resign@@ ed to the thought of sacrific@@ ing on@@ es@@ elf , one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience , &quot; he writes .
Instead , it is hor@@ ri@@ bly like &quot; a condemned man being stran@@ g@@ led sec@@ re@@ tly . &quot;
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away , and about new types of terror .
&quot; The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , &quot; Mr. En@@ gl@@ und writes , &quot; a war between factories . &quot;
He cat@@ ches the arrival of what he calls &quot; a new species in the besti@@ ary of the young century : the artic@@ ulate and ide@@ ologically convinced mass mur@@ derer in well-@@ cut clothes who perform@@ s his but@@ cher@@ y while sitting behind a desk . &quot;
People beh@@ ave in un@@ anticipated ways ; there is as much base behavior as hero@@ ism .
Mr. En@@ gl@@ und discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a ven@@ er@@ eal disease from pro@@ stitutes as a way to ev@@ ade service at the front .
&quot; The most gro@@ t@@ esque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gon@@ o@@ co@@ cc@@ al p@@ us , which soldiers buy and sme@@ ar into their gen@@ it@@ als in the hope of ending up in hospital , &quot; he writes .
&quot; Those who are really desper@@ ate ru@@ b it into their eyes , which often results in lifelong blin@@ dness . &quot;
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Gra@@ ves , Mr. En@@ gl@@ und &apos;s pro@@ se is supp@@ le but un@@ show@@ y , perfectly suited to his humane task .
In doz@@ ens of small scenes he cat@@ ches the way the war has &quot; un@@ le@@ ashed uniqu@@ ely un@@ controll@@ able forces : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hat@@ red . &quot;
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight .
The best books about World War I have often been obli@@ que , like Paul F@@ ussel@@ l &apos;s &quot; Great War and Modern Memory , &quot; or no@@ vels , like E@@ rich Maria Rem@@ ar@@ que &apos;s &quot; All Qu@@ i@@ et on the Western Front , &quot; rather than comprehensive hi@@ stories .
Mr. En@@ gl@@ und &apos;s volume jo@@ ins an un@@ conventional pan@@ the@@ on .
His book has the most devastating ending I can remember in a piece of non@@ fiction .
I won &apos;t give it away .
But it &apos;s as if he has reached from his book , s@@ nat@@ ched that dram@@ ati@@ s person@@ ae page from your f@@ ing@@ ers , and ligh@@ ted it with a match .
After an Ear@@ lier Mis@@ step , a Min@@ utely Pl@@ ann@@ ed R@@ aid
H@@ und@@ reds of police officers were involved , some of them wearing ri@@ ot hel@@ m@@ ets .
The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zu@@ cc@@ otti Park would be at its emp@@ ti@@ est .
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-@@ ranking officers , with others initially being told that they were embark@@ ing on an exercise .
Police Commissioner R@@ ay@@ mond W. Kel@@ ly was at the center , his presence under@@ sc@@ oring how the operation was frau@@ ght with challenges for the Police Department .
There could be no repeat of epis@@ odes in recent weeks , like the p@@ ep@@ per@@ -@@ spra@@ ying of protes@@ ters , that violated department rules and created a fi@@ restor@@ m of public sympathy for the squ@@ at@@ ters .
And so the police operation to clear Zu@@ cc@@ otti Park of protes@@ ters un@@ fol@@ ded after two weeks of planning and training .
Offici@@ als had prepared by watching how occup@@ ations in other cities played out .
A major disaster dri@@ ll was held on Rand@@ alls Island , with an eye toward Zu@@ cc@@ otti .
Offici@@ als increased so-called dis@@ order training - counter@@ terrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on L@@ ower Manhattan .
The last training session was on Monday night , on the Manhattan side of the East River .
The orders to move into the park came down at the &quot; last minute , &quot; said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assign@@ ment only as &quot; an exercise . &quot;
&quot; The few c@@ ops that I know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into Zu@@ cc@@ otti Park , &quot; said the person , who spoke on the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity .
&quot; The only people who were aware of them going into Zu@@ cc@@ otti Park were at the very highest levels of the department . &quot;
One reason for the sec@@ rec@@ y was a lesson learned by the city .
On Oc@@ t@@ . 14 , officials wanted to clear the park , but then backed off as hundreds of protes@@ ters stre@@ amed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans .
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units , including bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ wide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-@@ crime neighbor@@ h@@ oods .
Mr. Kel@@ ly said many people , almost like comm@@ uters , had been coming and going from the park during the day , making 1 a.m. a good time to move in .
&quot; It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , &quot; he said .
Emer@@ gency Service Unit trucks with k@@ lie@@ g lights and lou@@ d@@ speakers gathered at Pi@@ ke Sli@@ p and the Frank@@ lin D. R@@ oo@@ sev@@ elt Drive , near the Manhattan Bridge , before moving out .
The lights and prer@@ ec@@ ord@@ ed messages bo@@ oming from the lou@@ d@@ speakers seemed to cow many protes@@ ters .
As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their ligh@@ t-@@ blue wind@@ break@@ ers , many protes@@ ters simply gathered their belong@@ ings and left .
No t@@ ents were touched until 1 : 45 a.m. , the police said , giving the protes@@ ters time to gather their belong@@ ings .
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the per@@ im@@ eter to move in if arres@@ ts were needed in the park .
Re@@ por@@ ters in the park were forced to leave .
Paul J. Brow@@ ne , the Police Department &apos;s chief spo@@ kes@@ man , said it was for their safety .
But many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
Mr. Brow@@ ne said television camera trucks on Church Street , along the park &apos;s western border , were able to capture images .
As the police moved west through the den@@ se t@@ angle of protes@@ ters &quot; personal belong@@ ings , including luggage and plastic law@@ n and lea@@ f bags stu@@ ff@@ ed with clothing , cre@@ ws from the San@@ itation Department followed , s@@ co@@ oping up what was left behind .
Some protes@@ ters who refused to move were dra@@ g@@ ged out , the images appearing on the Internet soon after .
A core group of protes@@ ters took up positions close to the en@@ camp@@ ment &apos;s kitchen area , near the center of the park .
Some made a barrier , and the police moved in to metho@@ dic@@ ally arrest them .
About 10 people in the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the en@@ camp@@ ment locked themselves together by their arms .
And two people ch@@ ained themselves to trees , Mr. Kel@@ ly said .
Emer@@ gency service officers were called in to cut the lo@@ cks .
No arres@@ ts were made in the park until about 3 : 30 a.m. , Mr. Kel@@ ly said .
The cle@@ aring operation was complete about 75 minutes later , the police said .
Mr. Brow@@ ne said about 142 people were arrested in the park .
Most of the arres@@ ts were for &quot; dis@@ or@@ derly conduct and resist@@ ing arrest , &quot; he said .
The high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Es@@ posi@@ to , the chief of department , the top uni@@ formed officer in the department .
Phi@@ l T. Pul@@ as@@ ki , the department &apos;s chief of det@@ ectives , was also there .
Mr. Kel@@ ly , while present , was &quot; not direc@@ ting operations , &quot; Mr. Brow@@ ne said .
A second group of officers wa@@ ited along the eastern side of Broad@@ way , between Liber@@ ty and C@@ ed@@ ar Stre@@ ets , in case they had to move in .
Barri@@ ca@@ des were set up at Cor@@ t@@ land@@ t Street , a block north of the park , and at P@@ ine Street , a block south .
From those positions , the police were seen expanding the per@@ im@@ eter even far@@ ther out@@ ward from Zu@@ cc@@ otti Park .
At one point , several officers , many with shi@@ el@@ ds , were seen pushing people far@@ ther out .
About 28 people were on the northern per@@ im@@ eter .
Some of the row@@ dies@@ t action of the night took place south of the park .
Around 5 a.m. , south of P@@ ine Street , one prot@@ ester j@@ ump@@ ed on the hood of a police car , and others were seen rel@@ easing the air from the ti@@ res of a police van .
At one point , a piece of pl@@ ywood came flying from the crowd .
In the end , one officer and one prot@@ ester were hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
Support Wor@@ kers &apos; Union Will Su@@ e City Over Lay@@ off@@ s
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday , claiming the lay@@ off@@ s were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their dis@@ proportionate impact on schools that serve poor students .
The law@@ suit is possibly the last weapon available to the union , District Council 37 , in its effort to reverse the lay@@ off@@ s .
Six hundred s@@ event@@ y-@@ two school ai@@ des , parent coordin@@ ators and other employees who were among the city &apos;s lowest paid lost their jobs on Oc@@ t@@ . 7 , in a move union leaders have described as political pay@@ back for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring .
City officials have categ@@ or@@ ically denied that accus@@ ation .
At a City Council hearing last month , Scho@@ ols Chancellor D@@ ennis M. Wal@@ cot@@ t said the lay@@ off@@ s were a part of the budget they signed off on in June .
One council member fi@@ red back , telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off .
District Council 37 officials said they filed a notice of claim , warning the Department of Education that it would be su@@ ed ; it will hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce the law@@ suit &apos;s fil@@ ing formally , in State Supreme Court in Manhattan .
The suit will list Mr. Wal@@ cot@@ t and the city &apos;s Department of Education as def@@ end@@ ants , and counts eight la@@ i@@ d-@@ off workers as pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs , all of them black or Lat@@ ino women , as were most of the ai@@ des who lost their jobs .
Eli@@ zab@@ eth Thomas , a spo@@ kes@@ woman for the city &apos;s Law Department , said the city had not seen the law@@ suit and therefore could not comment on its specific alleg@@ ations .
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times , the union has zer@@ o@@ ed in on the number of lay@@ off@@ s at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequ@@ itable treatment , saying poor schools lost more ai@@ des because they had been chron@@ ically under@@ financed .
It points out that while there were no lay@@ off@@ s on St@@ aten Island and few lay@@ off@@ s in schools in the Upper East Si@@ de or Tri@@ Be@@ C@@ a , 17 school ai@@ des lost their jobs in District 23 in Brow@@ n@@ s@@ ville , Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , and 46 were let go in Distri@@ cts 8 and 9 in the South Bron@@ x .
Not@@ ing the loss of five out of eight school ai@@ des employed by Public School 36 in Har@@ lem , where 68 percent of the students live in poverty , the law@@ suit says , &quot; This is not a neighborhood of well-@@ he@@ eled parents who can fund@@ -@@ raise to make up the budget short@@ falls . &quot;
P.@@ S. 36 &quot; s budget was cut by 3.@@ 26 percent this year , and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calcul@@ ates the extra financing for each poor student schools en@@ roll .
The union also claims that high school princip@@ als may have been mis@@ led by the language in a mem@@ o authori@@ zing the dis@@ miss@@ al of parent coordin@@ ators .
The mem@@ o used the word &quot; excess &quot; to describe the action , even though &quot; excess &quot; more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school &apos;s pay@@ roll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .
&quot; Six@@ ty-@@ six parent coordin@@ ators were laid off , &quot; the draft complaint says , &quot; and not merely exc@@ essed . &quot;
Mission over , Congress ready to agree on Libya
It finally looks like Republic@@ ans and Democrats on Cap@@ it@@ ol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the up@@ rising in Libya .
All it took was for the revol@@ t to succeed , long@@ time dict@@ ator Mo@@ amm@@ ar G@@ add@@ af@@ i to be captured and killed and American involvement to end .
On Tuesday , the Sen@@ ate Foreign Relations Committee is to consider a resolution , sponsor@@ ed by Chairman John K@@ erry ( D-@@ M@@ ass . ) , along with Sens@@ . John Mc@@ C@@ ain ( R-@@ Ari@@ z . ) and Joseph I. Lie@@ ber@@ man ( I-@@ Con@@ n . ) , appl@@ au@@ ding Liby@@ ans for their successful re@@ bel@@ lion and U.S. troops for their &quot; bra@@ very . &quot;
&quot; This resolution is about hon@@ oring the courage@@ ous people of Libya as they begin to re@@ build their country , &quot; K@@ erry said .
&quot; It &apos;s an affir@@ mation of bi@@ parti@@ san support for their democratic aspirations . &quot;
The language may sound inno@@ cu@@ ous , but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far .
This summer , law@@ makers from both parties squ@@ ab@@ b@@ led with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or dis@@ approve of the U.S. military &apos;s role in the NATO mission in Libya .
In June , K@@ erry and Mc@@ C@@ ain introduced a resolution authori@@ zing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya .
The bill was defe@@ ated in the House by a wide bi@@ parti@@ san margin , and it never came up for a vote in the Sen@@ ate .
But on the same day that bill failed in the House , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya .
That left the U.S. mission in a form of legislative pur@@ g@@ atory - with Congress up@@ set enough to critici@@ ze Obama &apos;s handling of the mission but not so an@@ gr@@ y as to actually pull the rug out from under it .
Then Congress &apos;s in@@ decision was over@@ taken by events .
Tri@@ poli fell to Liby@@ an re@@ bels in August , and G@@ add@@ af@@ i was killed Oc@@ t@@ . 20 .
The NATO mission officially ended Oc@@ t@@ . 31 .
Now the Sen@@ ate may be ready to act .
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution &quot; congrat@@ ul@@ ates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary res@@ ili@@ ence in liber@@ ating themselves &quot; and &quot; comm@@ ends the men and women of the United States Ar@@ med For@@ ces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bra@@ very and professionalism . &quot;
The resolution also &quot; affir@@ ms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irre@@ ver@@ sible transition to democracy in Libya . &quot;
Will the new measure earn the full support of the Foreign Relations panel , or will it split law@@ makers like the June bill did ?
The last version was opposed by Sen@@ . Richard G. Lu@@ gar ( In@@ d . ) , the committee &apos;s top Republic@@ an .
Lu@@ gar &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet .
A@@ cross the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the House is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget , a top legislative priority of nearly every con@@ gres@@ sional Republic@@ an and some Democrats .
The measure , sponsor@@ ed by Rep@@ . B@@ ob Goo@@ d@@ lat@@ te ( R-@@ V@@ a . ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the House or Sen@@ ate this Congress .
Other law@@ makers have been un@@ successful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor , but not for lack of trying .
Goo@@ d@@ lat@@ te &apos;s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this Congress , spann@@ ing a wide range of topics .
Some are duplic@@ ates - the same bill offered in both the House and Sen@@ ate - and others are slight variations on each other .
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone , and another hand@@ ful that would &quot; control federal spending . &quot;
Some of those b@@ ills are identical too , but they give their spons@@ ors - particularly fresh@@ men Republic@@ ans looking to bur@@ nis@@ h their res@@ umes - the chance to bra@@ g that they &quot; auth@@ ored &quot; such a measure .
The Budget Control Act , which passed in August , required that both the House and Sen@@ ate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
In March , 58 sen@@ ators voted in favor of a non-@@ binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment .
Beyond the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve , while Rep@@ . José E. Ser@@ ran@@ o ( D-@@ N@@ .@@ Y@@ . ) wants to lift the two-@@ term limit for pres@@ idents .
Rep@@ . J@@ esse L. Jackson J@@ r . ( D-@@ I@@ ll . ) has offered a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects .
An amendment prohi@@ bit@@ ing sam@@ e-@@ sex marriage is a per@@ enni@@ al offering , as is one prohi@@ bit@@ ing flag@@ -@@ burning .
Some law@@ makers also want to allow for the n@@ ul@@ li@@ fication of federal laws if they are opposed by two-@@ thirds of the states .
As e@@ ager as members have been to offer amendments , they &apos;re not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
In the 11@@ 1@@ th Congress , law@@ makers offered 77 such amendments , and they introduced 66 in the 1@@ 10th .
The pace p@@ ales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years , according to numbers provided by the Sen@@ ate Library .
But they weren &apos;t much more successful then than they are now .
The last amendment to be added - the 27@@ th - was ratified in 1992 , but it was actually proposed by Congress in 17@@ 89 .
&quot; Be@@ at up but not be@@ aten , &quot; Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds speaks in first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a g@@ un@@ man shot her at point@@ -@@ blan@@ k range at a constitu@@ ent event in Tu@@ c@@ son , Rep@@ . Gabri@@ elle Gi@@ ff@@ for@@ ds ( D-@@ Ari@@ z . ) appeared on national television Monday night , s@@ ang along to the Broad@@ way show tune &quot; The Sun Will Come Out Tom@@ orrow &quot; and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to Congress .
Ap@@ pe@@ aring on AB@@ C News &apos;s &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; with Di@@ ane Sa@@ w@@ yer , Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds stru@@ gg@@ led to formed sentences and needed help walking .
The show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inf@@ lic@@ ted by a bul@@ let that fra@@ c@@ tured her sk@@ ull and p@@ ier@@ ced the left side of her brain , passing from the front to the back of her head .
Three months ago , she made a surprise return to the House to tri@@ um@@ ph@@ antly cast her vote on the deb@@ t-@@ ceiling deal .
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six and wo@@ unded 13 , Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds sm@@ iled , lau@@ gh@@ ed and s@@ ang - and described her recovery as &quot; difficult . &quot;
A@@ sk@@ ed by Sa@@ w@@ yer how she feels , Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds , 41 , responded , &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty good . &quot;
The interview with Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds and her husband , a@@ stron@@ aut Mark Kel@@ ly , was part of an ho@@ ur@@ -@@ long &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; special that ai@@ red on the eve of the release of the couple &apos;s new book , &quot; Gab@@ by : A St@@ ory of Cour@@ age and H@@ ope . &quot;
The special tra@@ ced Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds &apos;s recovery since the Jan@@ . 8 shooting .
In videos shot by Kel@@ ly in the first few weeks , she is seen in her hospital bed , her head sha@@ ved and a long scar across her foreh@@ ead .
She is capable only of holding up one or two f@@ ing@@ ers as her husband encourages her .
Mon@@ ths later , Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds is seen sitting up in a whe@@ el@@ chair as therap@@ ists teach her how to perform simple actions .
A no@@ d of the head .
A pu@@ cker of the li@@ ps .
And then , her first word : &quot; What . &quot;
Within days , Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds ut@@ tered another word - &quot; to@@ ast , &quot; a request for a change in her breakfast menu .
Videos ai@@ red by AB@@ C show that music played a central role in Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds &apos;s recovery : The con@@ gres@@ s@@ woman is seen singing along with therap@@ ists to C@@ yn@@ di Lau@@ per &apos;s &quot; Gir@@ ls Just W@@ anna Have F@@ un &quot; and Tom Pet@@ ty &apos;s &quot; Free Fal@@ lin . &quot; &quot;
In the interview with Sa@@ w@@ yer , Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds , who goes through two hours of therapy every day , said she has no memory of the day of the shooting .
Her husband said that he was reading Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds a newspaper story about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed in the incident .
Sus@@ p@@ ected g@@ un@@ man J@@ ared Lee Lou@@ gh@@ ner is being held at a Mis@@ sour@@ i prison and is being for@@ ci@@ bly medic@@ ated as he awaits trial .
&quot; A lot of people died , &quot; Gi@@ f@@ for@@ ds told Sa@@ w@@ yer .
&quot; T@@ ough , tough , tough . &quot;
At one point in his wife &apos;s recovery , Kel@@ ly told Sa@@ w@@ yer , she said , &quot; I &apos;ve been be@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; So , I would say , &quot; Gab@@ by , you have not been be@@ aten , &quot; &quot; Kel@@ ly said .
You &apos;ve just been beat up .
And you &apos;re going to get through this , and you &apos;re going to recover and you &apos;re going to come back stronger than ever .
Tro@@ ops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street g@@ ala that raised millions of dollars for hom@@ eless veter@@ ans in New York City .
K@@ id Rock s@@ ang a ball@@ ad about hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , fru@@ stration and loss .
On cu@@ e , several hundred soldiers , sail@@ ors , air@@ men and Mar@@ ines stro@@ de into position around him .
The black@@ -@@ tie crowd rose to its feet and che@@ ered .
&quot; The servi@@ c@@ emen and women were regarded as her@@ oes , &quot; said David Sal@@ tz@@ man , who organized the spring fund@@ ra@@ iser .
A senior military officer at the g@@ ala , also attended by the Joint Chi@@ efs th@@ en-@@ chairman , Ad@@ m. Mike Mul@@ len , saw the troops &quot; role differently .
&quot; They were rolled out like some sort of orph@@ an k@@ id , &quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail .
I &apos;m sure the organiz@@ ers meant well .
I know they did .
But it wasn &apos;t respect , really . It was pity .
The stark@@ ly conflic@@ ting impres@@ sions illustr@@ ate the un@@ easy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes ad@@ oring American public .
The troops are la@@ vis@@ hed with praise for their sacrific@@ es .
But the praise comes with a price , service members say .
The public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform .
&quot; We aren &apos;t victims at all , &quot; said Bri@@ g. Gen@@ . S@@ ean B. Mac@@ Far@@ land , who comm@@ anded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan .
&quot; But it seems that the only way that some can be suppor@@ tive is to cast us in the role of ha@@ pl@@ ess sou@@ ls . &quot;
The topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear ung@@ rat@@ eful or at odds with the public they serve .
They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War was far worse .
As a result , most of the convers@@ ations about pity take place quiet@@ ly and priv@@ ately among combat veter@@ ans .
After his two sons returned from combat tours with the Mar@@ ines , reti@@ red Col@@ . Mark Can@@ cian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives .
Some would look at them with a sense of a@@ we because they faced down ins@@ urg@@ ents and travel@@ ed to exotic places .
Others would wonder whether there was an &quot; an@@ gr@@ y , violent veter@@ an ben@@ e@@ ath the surface , &quot; said Can@@ cian , who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government job in Washington .
During his job search , he said , he sens@@ ed that some inter@@ vie@@ wers had sub@@ tly in@@ quired whether he would be able to hold up under the stra@@ in of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour .
&quot; When you talk about your service , you need to counter the negative impres@@ sions , &quot; Can@@ cian rec@@ alled telling his sons .
The military &apos;s un@@ ease springs , in part , from American in@@ difference to the wars .
B@@ att@@ le@@ field achievements are rarely sing@@ led out for praise by a country that has little famili@@ arity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
&quot; We , as a nation , no longer value military hero@@ ism in ways that were entirely common in World War II , &quot; said reti@@ red Lt@@ . Gen@@ . David Bar@@ no , who comm@@ anded U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Instead , praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member &apos;s suffering .
Tro@@ ops are recognized for the number of tours they have end@@ ured , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their in@@ jur@@ ies .
Milit@@ ary Fac@@ es Moun@@ ting Pres@@ sure to Cra@@ ck D@@ own on Rap@@ e
This week , a land@@ mark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged in@@ action on rap@@ e .
If not , hundreds of pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs are lining up for the next one .
Pf@@ c. Eli@@ zab@@ eth Ly@@ man was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregn@@ ant the night she says she was rap@@ ed by a fellow soldi@@ er .
It was October 2008 , and she was heading back to her bar@@ ra@@ cks at Mir@@ am@@ ar Air Station , just north of San Di@@ ego , after dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-@@ pack of beer .
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .
&quot; A red flag went up , &quot; Ly@@ man says .
But the Texas native br@@ us@@ hed aside her concern .
I thought , no , he &apos;s 19 .
&quot; He &apos;s from Texas , &quot; she says .
&quot; I wish I had listened to my inst@@ inc@@ ts . &quot;
Within minutes of entering Ly@@ man &apos;s room , the man came up from behind her , thro@@ wing her down and rap@@ ing her , she alleg@@ es .
This week , on Nov@@ . 18 , Ly@@ man and 27 other current and former military personnel will anx@@ i@@ ously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in Ar@@ ling@@ ton , V@@ a . , that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secret@@ ary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald R@@ ums@@ feld , will go to trial .
The suit alleg@@ es that Gates and R@@ ums@@ feld failed to cur@@ tail widespread rap@@ e within the military , in violation of soldiers &quot; constitutional rights .
Fil@@ ed in February by Sus@@ an Bur@@ ke , a Washington , D.@@ C. , att@@ or@@ ney , the suit initially involved 17 pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men , all of whom al@@ lege that they were rap@@ ed or sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate , prosec@@ ute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .
Bur@@ ke says she is going after the military &apos;s top br@@ ass because the problem begins with them .
&quot; The military is a top-@@ down structure , &quot; she says .
&quot; Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradic@@ ate the culture of ret@@ ali@@ ation ? The top leadership . &quot;
Bur@@ ke also says that since February , she has been cont@@ acted by nearly 400 other survi@@ vors , many of whom could be part of future suits .
Her strategy : rather than p@@ iling all the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one bas@@ ket , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .
The defense team for the Department of Def@@ ense , led by United States Att@@ or@@ ney N@@ eil Mac@@ Bri@@ de , has filed a motion to dis@@ miss the case .
The court papers , obtained by News@@ week , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be su@@ ed by current or former soldiers for in@@ jur@@ ies incurred in the armed forces .
Per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Fer@@ es Doc@@ tr@@ ine , the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by activ@@ e-@@ duty personnel .
&quot; The alleged har@@ ms are incident to pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs &quot; military service , &quot; the documents say .
The Department of Def@@ ense dec@@ lined to comment for this story .
Th@@ ings have changed since the &apos; 50@@ s .
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have clear front lines .
In both Iraq and Afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .
The result : between those two wars , 150 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during combat situations .
It &apos;s time for the military to moderni@@ ze as well , Bur@@ ke says .
She isn &apos;t alone in her fight ; three other law@@ suits are under way in addition to h@@ ers .
At Y@@ ale Law School , the Veter@@ ans &quot; Legal Services Clin@@ ic is preparing a case against the four major military ac@@ ade@@ mies for alle@@ ge@@ dly fo@@ stering a mis@@ og@@ y@@ nis@@ tic atmosphere .
Se@@ par@@ ately , the non@@ profit Vietnam Veter@@ ans of America is ass@@ em@@ bling a suit against the military that focuses on the &quot; personality dis@@ order &quot; diagno@@ ses assigned to rap@@ e victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurr@@ ence , according to activists such as An@@ u B@@ ha@@ g@@ w@@ ati of the Service Women &apos;s Action Network , a human@@ -@@ rights group .
Her group filed a suit in December against the Veter@@ ans Administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it hand@@ les benefit claims for people who say they were sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted in the service .
N@@ ine separate b@@ ills have been introduced in Congress by a bi@@ parti@@ san mix of sen@@ ators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .
In 2010 there were 3,@@ 15@@ 8 sexual ass@@ aults reported , according to the Department of Def@@ ense &apos;s Sex@@ ual Ass@@ ault Pre@@ vention and Respon@@ se Office .
But ass@@ aults are not@@ ori@@ ously under@@ reported , and by the Pent@@ ag@@ on &apos;s own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 13.@@ 5 percent of the estimated 19@@ ,000 incidents that occurred that year .
The report , released in March , also exam@@ ines prosec@@ ution rates : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .
The pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs in Bur@@ ke &apos;s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of trau@@ mas .
In Ly@@ man &apos;s case , she reported the alleged rap@@ e to military police less than an hour after it occurred .
That night , she says , she was asked to re@@ count the details of her rap@@ e 11 separate times to a stream of police , doctors , and comm@@ anders .
She did a rap@@ e kit , and her ass@@ ail@@ ant &apos;s blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
Six months later , in April 2009 , Ly@@ man sat through a hearing before a judge , during which she was ques@@ tioned about having had sex with her boy@@ friend earlier on the day of the attack .
Six people t@@ esti@@ fied as character witn@@ esses on behalf of the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator , who was eventually acqu@@ itted .
&quot; I remember the day when the ver@@ dict was read , &quot; Ly@@ man says .
&quot; I thought I was going to go into labor - I ran scre@@ aming from the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; They put me into the psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c unit , and when I got out , I remember saying to my command officer , &quot; That wasn &apos;t his trial . That was my trial . &quot; &quot;
Ly@@ man was ordered to visit a military psy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist , who eventually diagno@@ sed her with a personality dis@@ order , ren@@ dering her un@@ fit for service .
In January 2010 she was dischar@@ ged under less@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ hon@@ or@@ able terms , preventing her from receiving any benefits .
As for whether the case filed by Ly@@ man and her fellow pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs moves forward , it &apos;s a long shot , says John Tur@@ ley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School .
However , he notes , &quot; In my view they should be able to move forward . &quot;
What stands between them and a ver@@ dict is this doctr@@ ine that has been critici@@ zed since it was first issued .
I &apos;ve been a lifelong cri@@ tic of the Fer@@ es Doc@@ tr@@ ine .
The military is decades behind because they don &apos;t have the same incentive and det@@ err@@ ent posed by liability .
He adds , &quot; The odds are heavily against them ... but it &apos;s important for them to try . &quot;
These things only change when good people are willing to fight .
If the hearing doesn &apos;t go their way , Bur@@ ke , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs &quot; lawyer , will cu@@ e up her hundreds of other pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs for future cases .
&quot; We will continue batt@@ ling the military on this issue until reform occurs , &quot; she says .
Or until we die , whi@@ ch@@ ever comes first .
W@@ alls Have E@@ yes : How Res@@ ear@@ chers Are Stu@@ dying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-@@ wing extremis@@ m in Europe , Anders B@@ ehr@@ ing Brei@@ vi@@ k was just another guy air@@ ing his anti-@@ immigration views online .
On Monday , Brei@@ vi@@ k , who admitted to a killing spre@@ e in Norway in July which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
While Brei@@ vi@@ k may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cy@@ ber@@ space : he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , chat@@ ting with some of the millions of nation@@ alists who support right-@@ wing groups on soci@@ al-@@ networking sites .
After this summer &apos;s tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
But how to find them ?
Easy - just log on to Facebook .
&quot; We realized that it wasn &apos;t that difficult to get to them at all , &quot; says Jam@@ ie Bar@@ t@@ let@@ t , the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populi@@ sm by British think tank D@@ EM@@ OS .
Facebook &apos;s st@@ ash of personal information is so en@@ cy@@ cl@@ op@@ edi@@ c , says Bar@@ t@@ let@@ t , that the researchers could simply use the site &apos;s advertising tool to pin@@ point their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way mark@@ eters have been doing for years .
Bar@@ t@@ let@@ t &apos;s team found half a million fans of right-@@ wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads , but instead of linking to a new band or diet product , the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level , attitudes towards violence and optim@@ ism about their own future .
By reaching out through Facebook , Bar@@ t@@ let@@ t and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 fol@@ lo@@ wers of 14 far-@@ right parties in 11 European countries - all without ever leaving the office .
&quot; It &apos;s quite a new way of doing research , &quot; Bar@@ t@@ let@@ t says .
Some of the results aren &apos;t all that surprising : online supporters of right-@@ wing groups tend to be young , male , and v@@ ex@@ ed by immigration .
But in something of a tw@@ ist , &quot; those who combine their online activ@@ ism with offline activ@@ ism are more reasonable , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen . &quot;
D@@ EM@@ OS &apos;s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
Th@@ ink tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in &apos; Li@@ kes &apos; , wall posts and status updates .
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the Facebook &quot; data super@@ nov@@ a &quot; is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site &apos;s name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .
For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn &apos;t approach with a cli@@ p@@ board on the street .
&quot; Before , when you tried to survey people from the British National Party , it would be very difficult to identify them . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;d have to go through the party and they would never allow you access , &quot; says Bar@@ t@@ let@@ t .
&quot; Facebook cuts all that out - you go to them directly . &quot;
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle soci@@ al-@@ health problems .
A recent study by Dr. Meg@@ an Mor@@ eno of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in , Ma@@ dis@@ on and her colleagues found that under@@ gradu@@ ates who discussed their dr@@ unken explo@@ its on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .
Mor@@ eno suggests that students &apos; pe@@ ers , such as residential advis@@ ors , could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many boo@@ zy status updates .
&quot; You can &apos;t treat a problem if you can &apos;t diagno@@ se it , &quot; Dim@@ it@@ ri Christ@@ akis , Mor@@ eno &apos;s co-@@ author and director of the Center for Child Health , Beh@@ avi@@ or and Development at the Seattle Children &apos;s Research Institute , told the Washington Post .
&quot; We &apos;ve found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagno@@ sed . &quot;
Facebook , too , is constantly t@@ apping into its own population for data .
The site &apos;s Data Team has worked up stat@@ s on relationship status and Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s Day , vot@@ er turn@@ out in the 2010 mid@@ terms , and a National Happ@@ iness Index ( mainly using information only it can access - champ@@ ions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast tro@@ ve of data available to others for research . )
But Facebook &apos;s users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
But what about when Facebook users become part of a survey they don &apos;t even know about ?
While researchers have well-@@ defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline , online it &apos;s a free-@@ for@@ -@@ all .
&quot; I don &apos;t think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a resear@@ cher could be looking at their profiles , &quot; says N@@ eil Sel@@ w@@ yn , a soci@@ ologist at the London Knowledge Lab , of a 2006 study he conducted using students &apos; public Facebook walls .
&quot; As far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . &quot;
Then there &apos;s the question of methodology .
Even offline , there &apos;s no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .
On Facebook , it &apos;s impossible to know how much of a user &apos;s profile information and wall posts are true .
&quot; What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things , &quot; says Sel@@ w@@ yn .
Which is why , despite his years as a technology resear@@ cher , Sel@@ w@@ yn thinks a cli@@ p@@ board and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .
&quot; There &apos;s no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , &quot; he says .
&quot; Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place offline . &quot;
&quot; Cold and In@@ human &quot; : Anders B@@ ehr@@ ing Brei@@ vi@@ k M@@ akes First Public Court Ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance
Anders B@@ ehr@@ ing Brei@@ vi@@ k , the man who conf@@ essed to master@@ min@@ ding twin attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer , has described himself as a &quot; resistance &quot; figh@@ ter during his first public court appearance in Oslo .
&quot; I am a military comm@@ ander in the Norweg@@ ian resistance movement and K@@ nights Tem@@ pl@@ ar Norway , &quot; he said before a cour@@ tro@@ om packed with 500 people .
&quot; I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support h@@ ate ideology and because it supports mul@@ tic@@ ultur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; I acknowledge the acts but I do not ple@@ ad guilty . &quot;
Ju@@ dge Tor@@ k@@ j@@ el N@@ es@@ heim interrupted Brei@@ vi@@ k during that mon@@ olo@@ gue because he &quot; did not want to give Brei@@ vi@@ k the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views . &quot;
For the same reason he refused to allow Brei@@ vi@@ k , who brought a pre-@@ written speech with him , to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .
N@@ es@@ heim also ordered police to hold Brei@@ vi@@ k in cust@@ ody for 12 more weeks , banned him from accessing media for four weeks , and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspon@@ dence for eight weeks .
Around 30 survi@@ vors and victims &quot; relatives attended the hearing .
Some came hoping to look Brei@@ vi@@ k in the eye , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key .
All attended with the goal of moving toward closure .
&quot; I thought he seemed cold and in@@ human , &quot; one U@@ to@@ ya survi@@ vor told Norweg@@ ian broad@@ c@@ aster N@@ R@@ K .
&quot; It was un@@ comfortable , but for me I moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . &quot;
Dres@@ sed in a dark suit and blue tie , Brei@@ vi@@ k remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survi@@ vors in the eye as he entered and ex@@ ited the building .
Despite Brei@@ vi@@ k &apos;s bizarre notion of being part of a larger &quot; resistance &quot; movement , the judge determined that he is not ins@@ ane , and said that there is no evidence he acted with ac@@ complic@@ es .
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extrem@@ ist rather than a group of radic@@ als .
But that doesn &apos;t automatically ease the gri@@ ef and confusion that an entire nation still feels .
&quot; I wish he looked like a mon@@ ster , but he doesn &apos;t , &quot; a relative of one victim said .
&quot; It would be so much easier if he did . &quot;
7 L@@ ess@@ ons From the Lo@@ st Steve Jobs Interview , Sh@@ owing at a Theater This We@@ ek
Following the death of Steve Jobs on Oc@@ t@@ . 5 , there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - sing@@ ling out the tech geni@@ us as the Great Modern Inv@@ ent@@ or .
But what Apple fans might find most reve@@ aling in a recently re@@ discovered Jobs interview du@@ sted off in advance of special movie screen@@ ings in major markets this week , is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product work@@ flows .
He was certainly a designer , dre@@ amer and self-@@ identified hi@@ pp@@ ie , but he was also a me@@ ticul@@ ous organiz@@ er and f@@ low-@@ chart t@@ weaker - a man who believed that many business exec@@ u@@ tives suffered from &quot; a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... &#91; but &#93; there &apos;s a tremendous amount of cra@@ fts@@ manship between a great idea and a great product . &quot;
Back in 1995 , B@@ ob C@@ ring@@ ely was developing the TV series Tri@@ umph of the Ner@@ ds about the da@@ wn of the personal computer , and he sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for a rare , extended conversation .
At that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company Ne@@ X@@ T , looking forward to the popular adoption of the Internet .
While a small portion of C@@ ring@@ ely &apos;s interview was used in Ner@@ ds , he says that the interview &apos;s master copies went missing in shipping .
It was only following Jobs &quot; death that a complete V@@ HS copy was discovered in the director &apos;s garage .
This foot@@ age , slightly re-@@ edited , is the basis of the 6@@ 8-@@ minute Steve Jobs : The Lo@@ st Interview , coming to Land@@ mark Theat@@ ers this Wednesday and Thursday .
For someone known to lo@@ a@@ the in-depth interviews , Jobs seems surpris@@ ingly e@@ ager here to ex@@ po@@ und on his technological philosophi@@ es and business strategies .
And incredibly thou@@ ghtful .
At four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15-@@ second ru@@ min@@ ations , where Jobs is clearly weigh@@ ing his thoughts , aiming for precision .
There are also moments where Jobs &quot; perfec@@ tion@@ ism rises to the surface , where he seems imp@@ ati@@ ent about C@@ ring@@ ely &apos;s questions , nu@@ dging him to move faster towards issues or sub@@ pl@@ ots of greater import .
Fil@@ med before the era of Pi@@ x@@ ar , the iPod or the iPhone , there &apos;s something e@@ eri@@ ly pres@@ ci@@ ent about the Lo@@ st Interview , as Jobs ass@@ esses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of comp@@ uting .
It &apos;s one thing to read pos@@ thum@@ ous app@@ ra@@ is@@ als of Jobs &quot; career , but there &apos;s something raw and inspir@@ ing about the Jobs we see here , the anx@@ ious dre@@ amer on the br@@ ink of great@@ ness .
He has a vision for the way things could be and should be .
Not long after sp@@ elling it all out here he went and did it .
A quick r@@ und@@ own of seven notable Lo@@ st Interview sequ@@ ences :
On how he learned to run a business :
&quot; Throughout the years in business , I &apos;d always ask : &quot; Why do you do things ? &quot; and the answers you inv@@ ari@@ ably get are : &quot; O@@ h , that &apos;s just the way it &apos;s done . &quot; &quot;
Nob@@ ody knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in business .
That &apos;s what I found .
Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to stream@@ line accounting at Apple .
B@@ aff@@ led by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a &quot; standard cost &quot; that amoun@@ ted to a blind gu@@ ess , which was then adjusted with a &quot; vari@@ ance &quot; - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
On p@@ ranking the P@@ ope :
Jobs re@@ counts the &quot; Blue Box &quot; that he built with Steve Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak - a device that allowed people to effectively h@@ ack the phone company and make long distance calls for free .
The device has been widely written about before , but Jobs &quot; eu@@ ph@@ oria here in descri@@ bing the Blue Box as an act of em@@ power@@ ment is inf@@ ec@@ tious .
He describes how he and Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one AT &amp; T network to another while lo@@ oping in as many satelli@@ tes as possible .
&quot; We were wra@@ pping things around the globe a half do@@ zen times and you would y@@ ell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , &quot; Jobs says with a gi@@ ggle .
&quot; We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . &quot;
Us two , we didn &apos;t know much , but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson , and I don &apos;t think there would have ever been Apple without it .
Jobs goes on to detail one gl@@ orious p@@ rank that he and Wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak nearly pul@@ led of , ring@@ ing the Vati@@ can via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the P@@ ope , while doing their very best impression of Henry Kis@@ singer .
As various members of the Catholic hierarch@@ y were sum@@ mon@@ ed in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplom@@ at , the two bur@@ st into gi@@ gg@@ les just before the P@@ ope himself was ro@@ used to come answer the phone .
On falling in love with technology ( and col@@ d-@@ calling Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t ) :
At the age of 12 , on the h@@ unt for spare parts to build a frequency counter , he looked up Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t in the phone book and gave him a call .
Not long after their 20-@@ minute phone conversation , Jobs land@@ ed a part-@@ time summer job at He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard .
&quot; That made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . &quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company &apos;s Pal@@ o Al@@ to research lab@@ s , where he saw &quot; the first desktop computer ever made . &quot;
It was as big as a su@@ it@@ case , had a small ca@@ tho@@ de ray tube display , and I fell in love with it .
I would get a ride up to HP as a teen@@ ager and hang around that machine and write programs for it .
On impro@@ vising innovation :
At several points in the interview , Jobs talks about inv@@ enting new products on the fly .
Early in his career , as he set out to sell a hand@@ ful of circuit boards , he was asked by a customer to ass@@ emble the full computer .
Working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
Later while at Apple , he rec@@ alls the stru@@ gg@@ les he faced in developing a computer mouse :
&quot; I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were scre@@ aming at me that it would take five years &#91; to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 &#93; , and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer . &quot;
N@@ in@@ ety days later , we had a mouse we could build for $ 15 that was incredibly reliable .
On great companies losing steam :
Long before he led the revi@@ val of Apple , Jobs pres@@ ci@@ ently fores@@ aw the ways in which so many industry leaders would st@@ um@@ ble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .
&quot; S@@ ay you work at IBM or X@@ ero@@ x , so you make a better cop@@ ier or printer , so what ? &quot;
You have a monopoly of the market share , so the company &apos;s not more successful .
Sales and marketing makes it more successful , so &#91; it &apos;s those kinds of people &#93; who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision-making forum .
The product geni@@ us that led to that mon@@ opoli@@ stic position is rot@@ ted out by people who have no conception of good products v@@ s. bad products - the cra@@ fts@@ manship required .
That &apos;s what happened at X@@ ero@@ x ...
X@@ ero@@ x could have owned the entire computer industry .
It could have been ten times its size , could have been the Microsoft of the 9@@ 0s ...
They grab@@ bed defeat from victory .
On innovation as art form :
&quot; There &apos;s a tremendous amount of cra@@ fts@@ manship between a great idea and a great product ... as you evol@@ ve that great idea , it changes and grows . &quot;
You learn a lot about the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of it .
There are trade@@ off@@ s you have to make - certain things you can &apos;t make elec@@ tr@@ ons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...
Ultim@@ ately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to ex@@ pose yourself to the best stuff humans have done , and then trying to bring those things in to what you &apos;re doing .
Pic@@ asso said that good artists copy , great artists ste@@ al .
We &apos;ve always been sham@@ eless about ste@@ aling great ideas .
It &apos;s part of what made the Mac@@ in@@ to@@ sh great , was that the people who were working on it were musicians , po@@ ets , artists , zo@@ ologists , hist@@ ori@@ ans who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
If not for computer science , they would be doing amazing things in other fields .
Sc@@ alia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challeng@@ ers as court takes case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically di@@ visi@@ ve question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama &apos;s healthcare law , two of its jus@@ tices , Ant@@ on@@ in Sc@@ alia and Clar@@ ence Thomas , were f@@ eted at a dinner sponsor@@ ed by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .
The occasion was last Thursday , when all nine jus@@ tices met for a conference to pour over the peti@@ tions for review .
One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the swe@@ eping healthcare over@@ hau@@ l passed by Congress last year , a law that has been a r@@ all@@ ying c@@ ry for conservative activists nation@@ wide .
The jus@@ tices agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a land@@ mark 5 1 / 2-@@ hour argument is expected in March , and the outcome is likely to further ro@@ il the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full s@@ wing by the time the court &apos;s decision is released .
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul C@@ lement , who served as U.S. so@@ lic@@ it@@ or general during the George W. Bush administration .
C@@ lement &apos;s law firm , B@@ anc@@ ro@@ ft PL@@ L@@ C , was one of almost two do@@ zen firms that helped spons@@ or the annual dinner of the Feder@@ alist Society , a long@@ standing group dedicated to advoc@@ ating conservative legal principles .
Another firm that sponsor@@ ed the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the trade associations that challeng@@ ed the law , the National Federation of Independent Business .
Another spons@@ or was pharmaceutical giant P@@ fi@@ zer Inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the li@@ tig@@ ation .
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court &apos;s conference over the case .
In attend@@ ance was , among others , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell , the Sen@@ ate &apos;s top Republic@@ an and an av@@ owed oppon@@ ent of the healthcare law .
The featured guests at the dinner ? Sc@@ alia and Thomas .
It &apos;s nothing new : The two jus@@ tices have been attending Feder@@ alist Society events for years .
And it &apos;s nothing that runs af@@ oul of ethics rules .
In fact , jus@@ tices are exemp@@ t from the Code of Con@@ duc@@ t that govern@@ s the actions of lower federal jus@@ tices .
If they were , they argu@@ ably fell under code &apos;s Canon 4@@ C , which states , &quot; A judge may attend fund@@ -@@ raising events of law@@ -@@ related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . &quot;
Nevertheless , the she@@ er proximity of Sc@@ alia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm eth@@ ic@@ s-@@ in-@@ government activists .
&quot; This stunning breach of ethics and in@@ difference to the code bel@@ ies claims by several jus@@ tices that the court ab@@ ides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , &quot; said B@@ ob Ed@@ gar , the president of Common C@@ ause .
&quot; The jus@@ tices were win@@ ing and dining at a black@@ -@@ tie fund@@ ra@@ iser with att@@ or@@ neys who have pending cases before the court . &quot;
Their appearance and assistance in fund@@ raising for this event under@@ cuts any claims of im@@ parti@@ ality , and is unacceptable .
Sc@@ alia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agen@@ da@@ -@@ driven groups such as the Feder@@ alist Society .
And Thomas &quot; wife , G@@ in@@ ni , is a high-@@ profile conservative activ@@ ist .
Moreover , conserv@@ atives argue that it &apos;s Justice El@@ ena K@@ ag@@ an who has an ethical issue , not Sc@@ alia and Thomas .
K@@ ag@@ an served as so@@ lic@@ it@@ or general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
Her critics have pushed for K@@ ag@@ an to rec@@ use herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be im@@ partial now .
K@@ ag@@ an has given no indication she will do so .
Bo@@ eing gets record $ 18-@@ billion jet@@ liner order
Em@@ ir@@ ates airline orders 50 tw@@ in-@@ a@@ is@@ le Bo@@ eing 7@@ 77 jet@@ lin@@ ers with an option for 20 more .
Bo@@ eing also s@@ ells six Bo@@ eing Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers to O@@ man Air , a deal worth more than $ 1 billion .
It &apos;s rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product .
But it &apos;s a big deal when the company is air@@ plan@@ e-@@ maker Bo@@ eing Co. and the list price for those 50 air@@ planes tot@@ als a record $ 18 billion .
Just as big is where Bo@@ eing got the order : the Middle East , a growing gold mine of future air@@ plane orders .
In a forecast released Monday , the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years will need 2,@@ 5@@ 20 air@@ planes worth $ 450 billion .
Bo@@ eing over the weekend announced its big@@ gest@@ -@@ ever order by dollar value for commercial air@@ planes - 50 tw@@ in-@@ a@@ is@@ le Bo@@ eing 7@@ 77 j@@ ets .
The block@@ bu@@ ster order came from Em@@ ir@@ ates airline in Dubai .
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , which would push the total list price to $ 26 billion , Bo@@ eing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show .
Then on Monday , Bo@@ eing said O@@ man Air ordered six Bo@@ eing 7@@ 8@@ 7-@@ 8@@ s , the so-called Dre@@ am@@ liner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities .
List price for six of those is more than $ 1 billion .
&quot; This is clearly a huge positive for Bo@@ eing , &quot; Mor@@ n@@ ing@@ star analy@@ st Ne@@ al Di@@ hor@@ a said .
&quot; The quality of these particular customers is pretty strong . &quot;
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their o@@ il-@@ producing nations .
So , not only do they have the money to pay for planes , but a sur@@ ge in fuel prices - usually damaging to airlines because it &apos;s one of their biggest costs - is not as detri@@ mental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil .
That &apos;s important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay air@@ plane orders when fuel prices rise , Di@@ hor@@ a said .
&quot; They have a natural h@@ edge , &quot; he said .
The Em@@ ir@@ ates order solidi@@ fies Bo@@ eing &apos;s lead in the market for wide-@@ body planes and helps hold at bay competi@@ tor Airbus SA@@ S &apos; attempt to en@@ cro@@ ach on its domin@@ ance with the A3@@ 50 air@@ liner .
Bo@@ eing &apos;s win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would push back the de@@ but of the largest A3@@ 50 , which compet@@ es directly with the 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 300@@ ER .
It delayed the de@@ but to add more thr@@ ust after customers demanded more pay@@ load and range .
Bo@@ eing Co shares rose 1.5 % to $ 6@@ 7.@@ 94 .
Mexico president &apos;s sister apparently defe@@ ated in Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an vote
Lu@@ is@@ a Maria Cal@@ der@@ on alleg@@ es that drug traff@@ ick@@ ers helped oppon@@ ent F@@ au@@ sto Val@@ le@@ jo of the PR@@ I in the govern@@ or &apos;s race .
President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on &apos;s sister appears to have lost her bid for govern@@ or of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an during violent state elections , and she alleged Monday that drug traff@@ ick@@ ers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents .
P@@ rel@@ iminary results gave the lead in the race for govern@@ or of the western state to F@@ au@@ sto Val@@ le@@ jo of the Institu@@ tional Revolu@@ tionary Party , or PR@@ I .
&quot; The intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an but for the entire country , &quot; Lu@@ is@@ a Maria Cal@@ der@@ on said in a radio interview a day after Sunday &apos;s vote .
&quot; They threatened our candidates , our pol@@ l workers .... They sei@@ zed bal@@ lot boxes , set up road@@ blocks ... and ordered people to vote &quot; for the PR@@ I .
The PR@@ I ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000 .
But it is st@@ aging a com@@ eb@@ ack , and victory in Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an is an important step in that effort .
The PR@@ I is hoping to win the presidential election in July .
Val@@ le@@ jo appears to have only nar@@ row@@ ly ed@@ ged out Cal@@ der@@ on , who had led poll@@ s before election day .
Cal@@ der@@ on , a candidate for her brother &apos;s conservative National Action Party , or P@@ AN , refused to recognize Val@@ le@@ jo as the winner .
Sil@@ v@@ ano Aur@@ e@@ ol@@ es , the candidate for the le@@ f@@ ti@@ st Democratic Revolution Party , or PR@@ D , which currently holds the govern@@ or@@ ship , came in third , a bad defeat for the divided and ha@@ pl@@ ess left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote .
Aur@@ e@@ ol@@ es also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
Val@@ le@@ jo , former may@@ or of the state capital of Mor@@ el@@ ia , denied ties to drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and urged the other candidates to accept the results .
Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an has long been dominated by drug car@@ tels speci@@ alizing in mari@@ ju@@ ana , hero@@ in and me@@ th@@ amp@@ h@@ et@@ am@@ ines .
It is President Cal@@ der@@ on &apos;s home state , and he chose Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an to launch a militar@@ y-@@ led offensive against traff@@ ick@@ ers in December 2006 .
Yet violence has per@@ si@@ sted .
A P@@ AN may@@ or was assass@@ inated a week before the election as he campaign@@ ed for Lu@@ is@@ a Maria Cal@@ der@@ on , and numerous candidates qu@@ it local races out of fear .
For the PR@@ I , though , however n@@ asty the Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an election looks , a win will help the party &apos;s momentum .
The man expected to represent the PR@@ I in the presidential race , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , speaking from Washington , congrat@@ ulated Val@@ le@@ jo and said , &quot; I think this victory should be very encouraging , looking ahead to next year . &quot;
AD@@ B ur@@ ges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called for India and China to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term down@@ turn that will st@@ unt the growth of Asian economies .
Ra@@ j@@ at Na@@ g , the managing director of the Man@@ il@@ a-@@ based AD@@ B , said the world &apos;s two fast@@ est@@ -@@ growing large economies had to &quot; do all they can &quot; to speed the recovery of the the currency blo@@ c either through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
He warned against Bri@@ c &#91; Brazil , Russia , India , China &#93; countries looking at Europe &apos;s difficulties in a &quot; disp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate way &quot; and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term break@@ down in the global economy .
&quot; We are all in this together . &quot;
&quot; So anybody who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful , &quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the si@@ delines of the World Economic Forum in M@@ umb@@ ai .
&quot; Asia may be shi@@ el@@ ded to some extent but it cannot be immune . &quot;
&quot; So if China and India can help , by all means . &quot;
Europe &apos;s monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
In recent days , Italy &apos;s bor@@ rowing costs have so@@ ared danger@@ ously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resign@@ ed .
The un@@ fol@@ ding sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and promp@@ ted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution .
Mr Na@@ g predic@@ ted that any Asian support would be chann@@ elled through the IMF , but said bilateral assistance -- like buying the bonds of the EU &apos;s b@@ ail@@ -@@ out fund , the European financial stability facility -- offered greater bar@@ gaining power to Europe &apos;s Asian partners .
An@@ and Shar@@ ma , India &apos;s minister of trade , said that &quot; India will do whatever it can &quot; to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and a dr@@ ying up of foreign capital inf@@ lows .
&quot; Nob@@ ody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and tur@@ bul@@ ent , &quot; he said .
&quot; We have monum@@ ental challenges and we have to sustain a high level of growth . &quot;
&quot; It is not an option , it is an imperative , because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . &quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India have no business helping weal@@ thy Europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges .
Ash@@ ut@@ o@@ sh Var@@ sh@@ ney , a professor at Brown University in the US , said it would be politically very difficult to sell assistance to Europe to India &apos;s 1.@@ 2@@ b@@ n people , of whom as many as 800@@ m live on about $ 2 a day or less .
&quot; Some@@ time they will find out that Gre@@ eks reti@@ re at the age of 50 and go on holiday to beaches and it won &apos;t go down well , &quot; he said .
Lee How@@ ell , the managing director of the World Economic Forum , likewise ques@@ tioned why India &apos;s reserves should be used to keep Greece &apos;s numerous and well-@@ paid public sector workers in jobs in poor@@ ly managed , los@@ s-@@ making utili@@ ties like the railways .
Mr Na@@ g said that the eurozone crisis threatened &quot; significant kno@@ ck-@@ on effects &quot; across Asia .
The AD@@ B &apos;s forecast of 7.@@ 5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 now faced &quot; risks on the down@@ side &quot; because of the threat from Europe .
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot; contin@@ gency plans &quot; to protect themselves from a down@@ turn and significant capital out@@ flows from their economies .
D@@ ire war@@ nings from Pent@@ ag@@ on over potential defense cuts
Def@@ ense Secretary Le@@ on Pan@@ etta turned up the heat on Congress Monday , warning that lo@@ oming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hall@@ ways of the Pent@@ ag@@ on , to the batt@@ le@@ fields of Afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .
The Pent@@ ag@@ on already is di@@ gest@@ ing $ 450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $ 600 billion or more in cuts may be im@@ min@@ ent if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending .
&quot; The imp@@ acts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , &quot; Pan@@ etta said in a letter to Sens@@ . John Mc@@ C@@ ain , R-@@ Ari@@ zona , and Lin@@ d@@ sey Gra@@ ham , R@@ -S@@ outh Carol@@ ina .
He said that con@@ gres@@ sional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequ@@ estr@@ ation would trigger 23 % acro@@ ss@@ -@@ the-@@ board reductions and a halt to many new projects .
&quot; Such a large cut , applied in this in@@ discrimin@@ ate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects un@@ exec@@ utable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other moderni@@ zation efforts , &quot; Pan@@ etta wrote to the sen@@ ators .
&quot; We would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel invol@@ unt@@ arily and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to fur@@ l@@ ough civilians in order to meet the target . &quot;
&quot; These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage read@@ iness . &quot;
The cuts would eventually hit combat troops , Pan@@ etta said .
&quot; While war@@ time funding in the Over@@ seas Contin@@ gency Oper@@ ations accounts is not directly affected by the sequ@@ ester , war efforts would be ad@@ ver@@ sely affected by the severe dis@@ ruption in the base budgets , &quot; Pan@@ etta warned .
&quot; Contrac@@ ting personnel would be cut , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract over@@ sight that support the war . &quot;
&quot; Pay@@ roll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to war@@ time vend@@ ors , and legal and policy support would be dis@@ rupted . &quot;
The two sen@@ ators had written Pan@@ etta 10 days ago , asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Def@@ ense Department .
&quot; The consequence of a sequ@@ ester on the Def@@ ense Department would set off a swi@@ ft decline of the United States as the world &apos;s leading military power . &quot;
&quot; We are staun@@ ch@@ ly opposed to this dra@@ con@@ ian action , &quot; the sen@@ ators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Pan@@ etta &apos;s letter .
&quot; This is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . &quot;
&quot; The sequ@@ ester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States , and it should not be allowed to occur . &quot;
Whether the Pan@@ etta letter and the fresh war@@ nings from Sen@@ ators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exemp@@ t the Pent@@ ag@@ on from cuts remains to be seen .
Pan@@ etta has been increasingly outs@@ po@@ ken about the possible cuts , although he came to the top Pent@@ ag@@ on job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices .
At a news conference last week , the secret@@ ary of defense painted a ble@@ ak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core .
&quot; It &apos;s a ship without sail@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a bri@@ g@@ ade without bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s an air wing without enough trained pil@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a paper tiger , an Army of bar@@ ra@@ cks , buildings and bom@@ bs without enough trained soldiers able to accomp@@ lish the mission , &quot; Pan@@ etta said in his opening remarks at the Pent@@ ag@@ on .
&quot; It &apos;s a force that suff@@ ers low mor@@ ale , poor read@@ iness and is unable to keep up with potential ad@@ vers@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; In effect , it invites aggres@@ sion .. &quot;
In an ad@@ den@@ dum to his letters to Mc@@ C@@ ain and Gra@@ ham , Pan@@ etta sp@@ elled out new specific@@ s of how reductions &quot; generate significant operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . &quot;
And Pan@@ etta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .
That list included the F@@ 35 Joint Stri@@ ke Fi@@ ghter , a planned new bom@@ ber , the n@@ ext@@ -@@ generation bal@@ li@@ stic sub@@ marine , the new litt@@ oral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Mar@@ ines need to replace the hum@@ v@@ ee .
Hal@@ ting further development and testing the F@@ 35 could generate some $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from China and other ri@@ vals .
How to spot a lie
A gl@@ ance at recent head@@ lines indicates just how serious and per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve dec@@ eit and lying are in daily life .
Republic@@ an presidential candidate Herman C@@ ain is busy trading alleg@@ ations of sexual har@@ ass@@ ment with several women ; each side acc@@ uses the other of lying .
Administr@@ ators at P@@ enn State have been charged with per@@ jury for alle@@ ge@@ dly covering up reports that a reti@@ red football coach was sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ting boys .
Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open micro@@ phone asser@@ ting to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is a li@@ ar .
L@@ ying has destroyed care@@ ers and conv@@ ul@@ sed countries .
New York con@@ gres@@ sman and Internet f@@ las@@ her Anth@@ ony W@@ einer made a f@@ ool of himself issuing den@@ i@@ als quickly contradic@@ ted by in@@ contro@@ verti@@ ble evidence .
For@@ mer presidential candidate John Ed@@ wards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover@@ -up of an ex@@ tram@@ ar@@ ital affair .
And then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the media cir@@ cus President Bill Clinton un@@ le@@ ashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Mon@@ ica Le@@ win@@ sky .
T@@ ales of che@@ ating on school and college tests are ri@@ fe .
There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .
Ment@@ ors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and che@@ ating are acceptable .
How much dec@@ eit do we encounter ?
On a given day , studies show , you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
Now granted , many of those are white lies .
Another study showed that stran@@ gers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
Det@@ ecting lies , or &quot; lie spot@@ ting , &quot; is an essential skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .
Far from being a par@@ lor game similar to , say , char@@ ades , where the object is to exc@@ la@@ im , &quot; Got@@ cha , &quot; dec@@ eption detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in-depth research projects , especially in psych@@ ology and physi@@ ology .
One result of the research is that most old my@@ ths about lying have been deb@@ unk@@ ed .
Li@@ ars do look you in the eye .
They do not always st@@ utter , stamm@@ er , bl@@ ush or fi@@ d@@ get .
Don &apos;t conclude from this that li@@ ars are hard to spot and difficult to un@@ mask .
A trained lie spo@@ tter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure , fac@@ ial micro-@@ expressions , question formation and timing .
I spent several years surve@@ ying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on dec@@ eption , and it is clear that dec@@ eption detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navig@@ ating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hi@@ ring , inter@@ viewing , negotiating or managing .
Good li@@ ars are skilled at reading others well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intui@@ tively sens@@ ing how others perc@@ eive them .
We know from research that ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts lie more than intro@@ ver@@ ts , that men tell more &quot; self-@@ oriented &quot; lies while women tell more &quot; o@@ ther@@ -@@ oriented &quot; lies -- usually to protect someone &apos;s feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than un@@ married people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be &quot; wh@@ opp@@ ers &quot; ) .
We also know that if you are perceived as a wron@@ g@@ do@@ er , others will feel less gu@@ ilt in lying to you .
How do you tell if someone is lying ?
First , observe your subject &apos;s normal behavior .
This is called &quot; bas@@ el@@ ining . &quot;
It helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later .
Ob@@ serve your subject &apos;s post@@ ure , lau@@ gh , vocal quality .
You &apos;d better know if someone normally t@@ aps their foot all the time so you don &apos;t make un@@ just accus@@ ations when you see foot@@ -@@ t@@ apping in the middle of the meeting .
Then look for clu@@ sters of dec@@ ep@@ tive verb@@ al and non@@ verb@@ al behavi@@ ors .
Consi@@ der these clu@@ sters red flags , not proof of dec@@ eption .
Dec@@ ep@@ tive people might free@@ ze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their post@@ ure in significant ways or exhi@@ bit &quot; post-@@ interview relief &quot; -- that exagger@@ ated ex@@ hal@@ e of relief and shift in post@@ ure when all the hard questions are over .
Inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ators often fal@@ sely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post-@@ interview relief .
Also , pay attention to your subject &apos;s language .
Scott Peter@@ son fam@@ ously sli@@ pped and used the past ten@@ se while claiming his murdered wife was alive , launching a nation@@ wide search for her .
Dec@@ ep@@ tive individuals might also use distan@@ cing language : &quot; I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Mis@@ s Le@@ win@@ sky &quot; or repeat a hard question in its enti@@ re@@ ty .
The most common verb@@ al indicators are sub@@ tle .
Some@@ one might use lots of &quot; quali@@ fying language &quot; when answer@@ ing a hard question : &quot; Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge . &quot;
This ren@@ ders the answer perc@@ ep@@ tual rather than fac@@ tual and is often a red flag .
There &apos;s no magic bul@@ let for det@@ ecting lies , but developing skills to fer@@ ret out dec@@ eption is possible .
These skills will enhance anyone &apos;s chances of avoiding vic@@ tim@@ ization by sc@@ am artists in their professional and personal lives .
Contro@@ versi@@ al Oil Pi@@ peline Plan to Be R@@ er@@ ou@@ ted After Th@@ re@@ at of Del@@ ayed U.S. Appro@@ val
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- anger@@ ing unions while appe@@ asing environment@@ alists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it &apos;s willing to r@@ er@@ ou@@ te the project to get it back on track .
Trans@@ Canada said Monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sand@@ hills area of Neb@@ ras@@ ka , and is confident the project will still win approval .
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Neb@@ ras@@ ka Cap@@ it@@ ol .
Trans@@ Canada official A@@ lex P@@ our@@ b@@ ax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .
That comes after the State Department &apos;s announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sand@@ hills areas of Neb@@ ras@@ ka and the O@@ gall@@ ala a@@ qui@@ fer , a vast underground water supply .
&quot; This is a real path forward , &quot; Rep@@ . Lee Terr@@ y , a Republic@@ an from Neb@@ ras@@ ka , told Fox News .
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department likely would push off any decision until 2013 , after next year &apos;s elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision .
Obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the State Department &apos;s call , and expressed support for it .
The 1,@@ 7@@ 00-@@ mile pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico .
It would carry 7@@ 00@@ ,000 bar@@ rel@@ s per day from the province of Alber@@ ta to re@@ fin@@ eries in Texas .
To do so would require it crossing six states .
It is h@@ ated by environment@@ alists but loved by labor groups , who have ban@@ ked on the estimated 20@@ ,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
But Neb@@ ras@@ ka law@@ makers opposed to the plan are weigh@@ ing legislation to force a move away from the Sand H@@ ills region and O@@ gall@@ ala a@@ qui@@ fer , a major source of drinking water and ir@@ rig@@ ation .
The State Department &apos;s current Environmental Imp@@ act Stu@@ dy found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental imp@@ acts , but the energy industry source said the department &apos;s inspec@@ tor general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , cent@@ ering on two questions .
One is whether a lob@@ by@@ ist hi@@ red by Trans@@ Canada , Paul El@@ li@@ ott , who was a campaign advis@@ er to H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton in 2008 , represents a conflict of interest for the program .
The other is whether a firm that was hi@@ red to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to Trans@@ Canada .
Pat@@ ti La@@ B@@ elle Su@@ ed for Al@@ lege@@ dly C@@ aus@@ ing To@@ dd@@ ler to V@@ om@@ it out of Fe@@ ar
A New York family claims that disc@@ o di@@ va Pat@@ ti La@@ B@@ elle launched into a r@@ amp@@ age in the lobby of their Manhattan building , ter@@ rif@@ ying their to@@ dd@@ ler daughter to the point where she thre@@ w up in fear .
The &quot; Lady Mar@@ mal@@ ade &quot; singer &apos;s ti@@ ra@@ de fri@@ gh@@ tened 18-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old Gen@@ e@@ vie@@ ve Mon@@ k so badly that she suffered &quot; personality changes , sleep dis@@ order &quot; and &quot; increased fear of stran@@ gers , &quot; her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court suit .
It was Nov@@ . 10 of last year when sta@@ geh@@ and Kev@@ in Mon@@ k , his k@@ inder@@ gar@@ ten-@@ teacher wife , Ro@@ se@@ anna , and Gen@@ e@@ vie@@ ve were getting ready to go on a family trip .
While Kev@@ in Mon@@ k got the car , Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k came down to the lobby of their Ri@@ ver@@ side Bou@@ levard building with their luggage , carrying Gen@@ e@@ vie@@ ve .
Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment .
&quot; Some@@ one came up behind me and said , &quot; Do you know what your daughter is doing ? &quot; I said &quot; yes &quot; and went to pick her up , &quot; she said .
La@@ B@@ elle ang@@ ri@@ ly ad@@ mon@@ ished the pregn@@ ant woman .
&quot; She said in an aggressive tone , &quot; You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have left your daughter by the door , &quot; &quot; Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k said .
&quot; I told her , &quot; I have no interest in what you say or think . &apos; &quot;
She became en@@ ra@@ ged and started using prof@@ ani@@ ties -- the C-@@ word and the F-@@ word in a loud voice ...
She had a bottle of water and started fli@@ cking water from the bottle on me .
She said Gen@@ e@@ vie@@ ve got h@@ yst@@ er@@ ical .
&quot; I said to this woman , &quot; Look what you &apos;ve done to my daughter , &quot; &quot; the child &apos;s mother said .
La@@ B@@ elle l@@ ung@@ ed at the mo@@ m -- who was still holding Gen@@ e@@ vie@@ ve -- and had to be res@@ trained by her ent@@ our@@ age and pul@@ led out to a waiting car , Ro@@ se@@ anna Mon@@ k said .
The tot was cr@@ ying so hard that she v@@ om@@ ited , she added .
Later , the family sent a note asking for an ap@@ ology from La@@ B@@ elle but got no response .
La@@ B@@ elle &apos;s lawyer and representatives did not return calls for comment .
The suit seeks un@@ specified damages , but the family &apos;s lawyer , S@@ am Dav@@ is , said he took the case for free and that the family plans to don@@ ate any money it gets to a children &apos;s cancer char@@ ity .
&quot; The purpose is to hold Pat@@ ti La@@ B@@ elle responsible for her conduct , &quot; Dav@@ is said .
&quot; That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable , especially when aimed at a k@@ inder@@ garten teacher carrying an 18-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old child . &quot;
The clim@@ atic ad@@ versity slow@@ ed down the economy
During the first year of Mario L@@ op@@ ez Val@@ dez management , in Sin@@ alo@@ a increased the unemployment and the inform@@ ality , foreign investment dec@@ lined and the economy was reduced .
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sin@@ alo@@ a , being related to the first year of Mario L@@ op@@ ez Val@@ dez government also called the year of change , which generated great expectations as regards the development of the economy , but given the clim@@ atic ad@@ versity of the beginning of the year , there was no growth , however there was registered a decline in the main indicators of economic development .
The low February temperatures , not only did they cause losses of millions for the agricultural sector , but they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow , causing a contrac@@ tion of the economic activity in general of 3.@@ 6 percent in the first half of the year , mainly supported by the historic fall of 3@@ 1.@@ 16 per cent in agriculture , which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors .
According to the report regarding the areas affected by the fro@@ st , issued by the Mexican Council for Sustain@@ able Rural Development there were damaged 8@@ 3@@ 5.@@ 5@@ 82 hectares , out of which 7@@ 8.@@ 03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining of 21.@@ 07 percent had partial damage . The main damaged crops were the vegetables , cor@@ n and ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ a .
The fall in the economic activity has generated , until November , a constant increase of the unemployment in the state , according to the National Institute of St@@ atis@@ tics and Ge@@ ography , the unemployment state rate during the first three quarters of the year registered an acceler@@ ated growth , from January to March 5@@ 5.@@ 0@@ 53 Sin@@ alo@@ a habit@@ ants were unemployed , with a rate of 4.@@ 53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter , the rate became 5.@@ 28 percent , and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.@@ 19 percent , a rate that in terms of the number of people represents more than 7@@ 4.@@ 000 of unemployed Sin@@ alo@@ a habit@@ ants , an increase compared to the first half of 18.@@ 9@@ 69 individuals .
L@@ ower liquidity
Un@@ employment in Sin@@ alo@@ a during the year is multi-@@ fac@@ torial , for the econom@@ ist Ger@@ ardo L@@ op@@ ez Cer@@ v@@ antes , director at the Fac@@ ul@@ ty of Econom@@ ics and Social Sciences of the U@@ AS , the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly , depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken .
&quot; What we &apos;re seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors , including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constra@@ int imposed by the legislation that passed in the Congress in order to combat money la@@ undering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with , invest and use them in something &quot; he said .
St@@ opp@@ ed Im@@ migration
L@@ op@@ ez Cer@@ v@@ antes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor .
&quot; The number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad , in the United States has been restricted , first of all due to the difficulties to enter , and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job , that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here , in the state , causing the rate of unemployment to rise , &quot; he said .
Inform@@ ality
The labor market analysis of Sin@@ alo@@ a gets worse when considering the high level of inform@@ ality that prev@@ ails among the working conditions , according to IN@@ EG@@ I , 6@@ 0.@@ 38 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution .
In addition to the unemployment and inform@@ ality , another state labor remin@@ der is represented by low wages ; the entity has the lowest wages in the country , according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel@@ fare .
The monthly average income of Sin@@ alo@@ a workers was , until September , 5.@@ 3@@ 52 p@@ es@@ os , well below the national average , that is of 7.@@ 3@@ 75 p@@ es@@ os .
Contrac@@ tion of F@@ DI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and high unemployment rate , in 2011 there was recorded the largest decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years , according to the Ministry of Finance from January to June the state F@@ DI tot@@ aled 6@@ 3@@ 0.@@ 6@@ 97 dollars , which represents a fall of 8@@ 7.@@ 74 percent compared to the 5.@@ 14@@ 3.@@ 3@@ 12 dollars during the same period of last year .
For its part , the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accoun@@ ted a total investment of 17.@@ 28@@ 0.000 p@@ es@@ os during the year , which occurred mainly in ter@@ ti@@ ary sector companies .

Against the backdrop of economic down@@ turn , the state government asked in July during the state congress , the approval of a credit of 3 billion p@@ es@@ os , which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municip@@ alities , in order to re@@ activate the economy , the local con@@ gres@@ sional approval was for a total of 2.@@ 600 million p@@ es@@ os , and until November no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy .
Re@@ actions
For business representatives , the first year of Mario L@@ op@@ ez Val@@ des government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government .
Miguel Lor@@ edo L@@ op@@ ez , president of the National Chamber of Trans@@ formation Industry , said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmon@@ ization of the will@@ s of various sectors , including the state government itself .
&quot; The performance of the economy in Sin@@ alo@@ a this year has been really poor , one has to work hard in order to reg@@ ain the ground lost this year , in 2012 we must re@@ double our efforts , we failed to al@@ ign the efforts of all and above all the good and synchron@@ ized motion of the new government team , we hope that next year will be much better &quot; he said .
Economic slow@@ ness
L@@ op@@ ez Lor@@ edo said that the events such as early fro@@ st this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
&quot; The low economic flow is the product of several events , including fro@@ st , one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not turn fast enough for generating an economic dynam@@ ism that allows having an acceptable flow level of the processes , products and services and therefore , at the end of the year we are closing it below our expectations , &quot; he said .
Re@@ defining the vocation
Te@@ od@@ oro Sal@@ az@@ ar U@@ ri@@ arte , president of the Emp@@ loy@@ ers &quot; Con@@ federation of the Mexican Republic in Sin@@ alo@@ a , said that the state is required to prosec@@ ute the most dynamic productive activities .
&quot; Overall , we found that there has been working on , we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that re@@ defines the vocation and the economic course of the state , it is important to det@@ on@@ ate all the material and human potential resource that Sin@@ alo@@ a has , &quot; he said .
Work to Do
Cop@@ arm@@ ex President stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government .
&quot; Overall I would say that the Government has been stri@@ ving to be successful in various fields , in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term program , &quot; he said .
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy .
&quot; There are elements that allow us saying that the government is becoming more inclusive , and what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to do , &quot; he said .
They condemn him for 8 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of mari@@ ju@@ ana
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was the sentence given to a Nav@@ ol@@ ato citizen for the possession of eight ki@@ los of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
The General Att@@ or@@ ney Office reported that the sent@@ enced drug dealer is Om@@ ar Alex@@ is Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela Sand@@ ov@@ al , for the crime against health , in its vari@@ ant of possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana for purposes of trade .
According to the record AP / S@@ IN / CL@@ N / 6@@ 87 / 2010 / M@@ I , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela Sand@@ ov@@ al was arrested by the Mexican Army , the 7th of June 2010 , in a surveillance operation on the street Ci@@ pri@@ ano Val@@ dez , in front of the post 80 in the town of El Cas@@ till@@ o , Nav@@ ol@@ ato .
The drug dealer was driving a white pick@@ up truck , where he was carrying a black bag in the box of the vehicle and on the passenger &apos;s seat a small back@@ pack , where the soldiers found eight ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s and 23 gram@@ s of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
For these reasons , the ins@@ ured was put at the disposal of the Second District Court and the sent@@ enced person continues to be a pris@@ oner at the Center for Support@@ ing the Legal Con@@ sequ@@ ences of the Cri@@ me .
There must be made contributions to works
The social works referred to in the programs such as Hab@@ it@@ at , Res@@ cu@@ e of Public Sp@@ aces and 3@@ x@@ 1 for migrants risk not to be completed or to have serious delays due to the lack of funds , said Miguel Ang@@ el L@@ op@@ ez Mir@@ anda .
The Director of Mun@@ icip@@ al Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at risk because the State Government failed to make the contributions that correspond , which represent a resource superior to 11 million p@@ es@@ os in all three programs .
He noted that the total investment in these three programs is of nearly 50 million p@@ es@@ os , of which the State has to contribute with 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Mun@@ icip@@ ality have provided resources for the works , so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force .
&quot; They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a di@@ me , since starting with July they had to give us a part , &quot; he said , &quot; in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced , but we need the money . &quot;
He mentioned that last year , during the administration of Jesus A@@ guil@@ ar P@@ adi@@ lla , the State did not comply with the contributions it had to make , so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to bor@@ row money in order to cover more than 7 million , a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration .
&quot; It happened to us in the previous administration because the State did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued adv@@ ancing , and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending , &quot; he explained .
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources , he said that the request was made ​ ​ to the Secretary of Administration and Finance , Ar@@ mand@@ o Vil@@ lar@@ real , to speed up the efforts so that the percent@@ ages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible .
&quot; They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a di@@ me . &quot;
The court vali@@ dates &quot; digital television transition &quot; in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice ( SC@@ J ) rejected the constitutional controversi@@ es brought by the Sen@@ ate and House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives against the presidential decre@@ e that brings forward the so-called &quot; digital television transition &quot; from 20@@ 21 to 2015 , since the eight votes needed to invali@@ date it were not obtained .
A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Court , Juan Sil@@ va Me@@ za , considered that President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on did not exceed his authority by issuing a decre@@ e detail@@ ing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital ter@@ restri@@ al television .
With this result , the constitutional contro@@ vers@@ y promoted by the Sen@@ ate , was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pron@@ ounce on the constitu@@ tionality or un@@ constitu@@ tionality of the decre@@ e , and this remains in force .
The sentence project prepared by the Minister Ol@@ ga S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o , proposed to declare un@@ constitutional the decre@@ e , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telec@@ omm@@ unications Commission ( Co@@ f@@ et@@ el ) , in violation of the principles of hierarch@@ ical sub@@ ordin@@ ation and law reserve .
Only Z@@ al@@ di@@ var , Jor@@ ge Mario Par@@ do , Margar@@ ita L@@ una and S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o voted for the project .
With this argument , both the Sen@@ ate and the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties promoted two constitutional controversi@@ es to contradi@@ ct the decre@@ e , and to support the claims , the minister S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o suspended the application of the decre@@ e and all actions stipul@@ ated there regarding the digital transition .
At the ministers &quot; meeting there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , without entering into the discussion of the project , also in charge of the minister S@@ án@@ che@@ z Cor@@ der@@ o .
In his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
&quot; Nor do I consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body , &quot; and rec@@ alled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive , who has a constitutional mandate , the guidance of the State .
The replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and results in a better utili@@ zation of the radi@@ o-@@ electric spectrum , better signal quality and more channels .
Del@@ aying the change , he said , would mean del@@ aying the benefits of di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ation , which involves a public interest decision , which has not only a technical dimension , &quot; as it covers economic , social , political and national security issues . &quot;
These issues , he said , &quot; require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship , comprises a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the state executive power . &quot;
He rec@@ alled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition , and has done it through the executive , despite of having highly specialized technical bodies .
There cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the cont@@ ested decre@@ e , that inv@@ ades in any way the competence of the Congress , is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the Leg@@ islat@@ ure , he said .
They analy@@ ze the possibility of a &quot; vote by vote &quot; count in Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ án
According to the data transmitted by the PER@@ P the difference between the first and second place in the gu@@ ber@@ nat@@ orial election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes corresponding to 8@@ 79 of the total of 6.@@ 0@@ 74 minutes .
The possibility of counting &quot; vote by vote &quot; is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ án , where according to the data obtained from the P@@ rel@@ iminary Elec@@ toral Res@@ ults Program ( PER@@ P ) the difference between the first and the second place of the govern@@ or &apos;s election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes that correspond to 8@@ 79 of the total 6.@@ 0@@ 74 minutes .
In this regard , the President of the General Council of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ án Elec@@ toral Institute ( ME@@ I ) , Maria de los Angeles L@@ l@@ ander@@ al Zar@@ ago@@ za , rec@@ alled that a few days ago , the last November 9th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmon@@ ize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .
As it will be rec@@ alled , Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ án did not authori@@ ze the Constitution or the Elec@@ toral Code of the State or the Elec@@ toral Justice Act , since the Congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the Govern@@ or Leon@@ el Go@@ do@@ y R@@ ang@@ el om@@ itted its publication within the periods specified in the Law in the State Official Gaz@@ ette , argu@@ ing that he had some objections .
The same November 9th , the Supreme Court of Justice ( SC@@ J ) resolved the constitutional contro@@ vers@@ y promoted by the local legislat@@ ure and described as &quot; invali@@ d and illegal &quot; the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms , since he has no right &quot; to sanc@@ tion or vote them . &quot;
Inter@@ viewed about the possibility of the &quot; vote by vote , &quot; Maria de los Angeles L@@ l@@ ander@@ al stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the General Council of the ME@@ I it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body .
Thus , the partial re@@ count of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assu@@ mp@@ tions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alter@@ ations of the minutes .
In addition , the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting , is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates .
The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position , case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial re@@ count .
There should be noted that in this situation is the election of Mor@@ el@@ ia , where according to PER@@ P the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.@@ 16 percent , even without counting the votes of 12@@ 9 of the 9@@ 23 total minutes .

Wednesday there will be formed the new Italian government
The appointed prime minister , Mario Monti , will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
The designated Italian prime minister , Mario Monti , will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has end@@ anger@@ ed the entire euro zone .
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti , named on Sunday , will meet on Wednesday with the president , Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ polit@@ ano , to confirm that he can form a government .
He is expected to present a cab@@ inet composed largely of t@@ echno@@ cr@@ ats , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .
Monti said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government .
&quot; I want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase , &quot; said the former European commission@@ er to the re@@ por@@ ters .
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome .
The &quot; framework is now well del@@ ine@@ ated , &quot; he said .
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days , much less than the normal , while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to un@@ sustainable levels .
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders in order to reg@@ ain the confidence in Italy .
Under@@ lying the pressure on Monti to hur@@ ry , the inst@@ able markets put the yield of the Italian B@@ TP bonds to 10-@@ year above 7 percent , the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescu@@ ed .
Emm@@ a Mar@@ c@@ eg@@ ag@@ lia , leader of the Italian employers &apos; Federation told the re@@ por@@ ters after meeting with Monti : &quot; We said we would support very much this government . &quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation .
Monti &apos;s chances of success were considerably boo@@ sted by the support of the L@@ DP party of Sil@@ vio Berlusconi , who was forced to res@@ ign on Saturday due to the crisis .
&quot; We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are dest@@ ined to have a good outcome , &quot; said to the re@@ por@@ ters Angel@@ ino Al@@ f@@ ano , secret@@ ary of the cent@@ er-@@ right party .
The support of the L@@ DP , the largest party in Italy , is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of t@@ echno@@ cr@@ ats that Monti is forming .
Parliamentary support
Monti &apos;s new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be un@@ popular austerity reforms .
Any block@@ age or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster .
Monti began on Monday his consultations with the political parties , unions and business groups , as well as with youth and women organizations .
He will end his meeting on Tuesday night .
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Na@@ polit@@ ano , who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis .
After a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that Berlusconi would res@@ ign , the Italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between un@@ certain@@ ties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .
Res@@ cu@@ ing Italy with a public debt of 1.@@ 8 billion Euros would be too much for the current financial def@@ enses of the euro zone .
Monti has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013 , despite the widespread predic@@ tions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections .
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cab@@ inet , but the major parties insist that it must be made only of techni@@ cians , an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure .
Political sources said that the mutual mi@@ str@@ ust and dis@@ agreement between the parties are complic@@ ating the attempt to include political figures .
The famili@@ arity of the Spanish is higher than that of the T@@ ic@@ os
Of the 22 players called in Spain , ten passed 50 international games .
On the side of Costa Rica only one of 22 called players reached 50 games .
A minor contrast to Costa Rica , compar@@ ing the 22 players called by both countries for the friendly game today , at 3 : 05 pm at the National Stadium in San J@@ ose .
While the world and Europe champ@@ ions , number one in the monthly top of FIFA , have a long record of Class A inter selection , the Tri@@ color has only the def@@ ender Michael U@@ man@@ a as the only one who has 50 international games .
That number was reached Friday before the game against Pan@@ ama ( 0-@@ 2 ) , in R@@ omm@@ el Fern@@ an@@ dez .
Spanish football players playing in the All@@ -@@ Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in leag@@ ue and local cup competitions and there are high-level sho@@ cks in the European C@@ ups and Champ@@ ions League .
To this is added the Spanish F@@ ury experience in complicated qualifications for Euro and World Cup .
The T@@ ic@@ os players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as CON@@ C@@ AC@@ A@@ F , which is considered the lowest level within FIFA
We see that the peak of the Spanish selection is the go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper I@@ ker Casi@@ ll@@ as , who last Saturday against England ( game lost with 0-@@ 1 in London ) equ@@ aled the record of the ex go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper An@@ don@@ i Zu@@ bizar@@ re@@ ta , with 12@@ 6 international matches .
Casi@@ ll@@ as will play today against the Tri@@ color and will impose a new record of 12@@ 7 international matches for Spain .
X@@ avi Her@@ nan@@ dez , the player of Barcelona , has 10@@ 6 matches .
Casi@@ ll@@ as and X@@ avi were recognized last week by U@@ EFA together with the other player of the Iber@@ ian team , Zu@@ bizar@@ re@@ ta with 12@@ 6 matches and Schal@@ ke stri@@ ker Rau@@ l Gonz@@ al@@ ez with 10@@ 2 .
Almost near the cent@@ enni@@ al number is Car@@ les Pu@@ y@@ ol , with 97 games .
X@@ ab@@ i Al@@ on@@ so follows them with 91 , Fern@@ ando Tor@@ res , with 90 , David Villa and Ser@@ gio Ram@@ os , both with 81 , Andr@@ es I@@ ni@@ esta , with 62 , Ces@@ c Fab@@ reg@@ as , with 61 , and David Sil@@ va , with 53 .
On Costa Ric@@ an side , and close to Michael U@@ man@@ a , are the left-@@ later@@ al Junior Di@@ az , with 48 matches and the stri@@ ker Br@@ yan Ru@@ iz , with 45 .
After this , only five exceeded the 30 games : Kei@@ lor Nav@@ as with 31 , Rand@@ all Az@@ of@@ ei@@ fa with 32 , Michael Bar@@ ran@@ tes with 31 , Carlos Her@@ nan@@ dez with 36 and J@@ ose Lu@@ is L@@ op@@ ez with 35 .
The least .
More than 30 matches in Spain have Ger@@ ard Pi@@ qu@@ é ( 37 ) , Ser@@ gio Bus@@ qu@@ ets ( 36 ) , Santiago S@@ anti C@@ az@@ or@@ la ( 32 ) , Al@@ var@@ o Ar@@ bel@@ oa ( 31 ) and Rau@@ l Al@@ bi@@ ol ( 31 ) .
On the national side , with less than 30 pres@@ ences , there are Ro@@ y Mill@@ er with 26 , W@@ inst@@ on Parks with 26 , Gabri@@ el B@@ adi@@ lla with 25 and Ro@@ y My@@ ri@@ e with 23 .
The rest doesn &apos;t come near the 20 .
While Nach@@ o Mor@@ eal has only four games and Jor@@ di Alba two , in Costa Rica Vic@@ tor Boli@@ var has only one Ol@@ man Var@@ gas and N@@ elson Ed@@ der did not de@@ but yet .
The leading sc@@ orer of Spain is David Villa is , with 50 goals , followed by Fern@@ ando Tor@@ res with 27 .
For Costa Rica , Br@@ yan Ru@@ iz is the one that regi@@ sters more points , two more than Carlos Her@@ nan@@ dez and three more than Ro@@ y My@@ ri@@ e and Parks .
Quint@@ et included the country on the tour for celebr@@ ating two decades of experience
&apos;@@ Go@@ ing to Costa Rica is a dream come tru@@ e@@ &apos;
In an exclusive interview with Vi@@ va , the b@@ assist J@@ ef@@ f A@@ ment , of Pear@@ l J@@ am , said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium .
There were more than 20 years of wait , but the band says that for the member is also a dream turned into reality playing in the country .
This was stated by the b@@ assist and founding member , J@@ ef@@ f A@@ ment , who spoke exclusively with Vi@@ va , from Brazil , last week .
The group is on the South American zone within the tour celebr@@ ating two decades of work and Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America .
That day they will be present at the National Stadium , starting at 7 : 30 pm , together with the band of Los Angeles The X and the band of the nationals Las Rober@@ tas .
This is an exc@@ er@@ pt of the conversation , whose full trans@@ cript is online in The Nation .
For your fol@@ lo@@ wers from Costa Rica , is a dream come true that Pear@@ l J@@ am will play in Costa Rica ? Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing ?
Go@@ ing to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too .
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great .
I &apos;ve been to Costa Rica only once , on vacation , it is a beautiful country and I think we &apos;ll be able to stay a few days there .
So we are exc@@ ited to bring our music there .
I ask this because there is a kind of de@@ vo@@ tion to the band ; the fans live with intensity the days before the concert .
What do you say to your most fer@@ vent fol@@ lo@@ wers ?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years .
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here .
Some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year .
Does this add a bit of pressure on your visit ?
Some of the biggest shows we &apos;ve played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks .
We had a few wonderful shows in Sa@@ o Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica .
Re@@ ally , we are very e@@ ager to play there .
We love this country , we love to surf and the jung@@ le , for both things , Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world .
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing ?
We have many friends who are sur@@ fers and I have a great friend who lives in Tam@@ ar@@ in@@ do and the waves here are incredible .
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nic@@ ar@@ agua , along with Mexico , these are great places to surf , and that &apos;s how we learned about , through people who love surfing .
Vie@@ wing the tour , one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs .
What have you planned for the presentation in Costa Rica ?
As we have never played there before , then we have no restrictions on what we can do .
We will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs ; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse re@@ pertoire .
You never repeat the re@@ pertoire .
How come ?
I think it &apos;s partly because we have nine disc@@ s and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs , so it &apos;s difficult to choose which songs to play every night .
When we have two or three songs in the re@@ pertoire that we have not been playing for a while , this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it remin@@ ds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten .
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people .
With this tour , you are celebr@@ ating 20 years of experience .
Looking back , is it hard to believe all you have made ?
Yes , absolutely .
First , I think none of us could ever imagine we &apos;d be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream .
We count our bl@@ ess@@ ings and we are very exc@@ ited that we can continue making music together .
We all love each other and love making music .
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go .
Th@@ ings could not be better for us .
What does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of gr@@ unge ?
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands .
We are good friends of the people of Sound@@ garden , Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey and Ali@@ ce in Cha@@ ins .
It &apos;s amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual .
From time to time , arises a band of a city , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .
We are proud and hon@@ ored to be part of the Seattle group .
I still play with some of them from time to time .
Last year , we were at a festival with Ali@@ ce in Cha@@ ins and we were in Canada with Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey , we saw Sound@@ garden in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are hon@@ ored to be part of the Seattle sound that ar@@ ous@@ ed .
It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long .
Yes , four of us were together for 21 years and Mat@@ t ( Cam@@ eron ) joined us 13 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands la@@ sted .
First , I think we are all lucky to be still alive and , secondly , we all care about the others .
We are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been opened musical aven@@ ues that give each the freedom to experiment .
We trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better .
Your relationship to the word f@@ ame has not been easy ; but thanks to your success , you have been able to do whatever you wanted .
How do you find a balance ?
As we have grown , it has been easier to find a balance .
We take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crow@@ ds and people who love your music .
While one rem@@ embers that people are there for the music , that remin@@ ds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star , something that none of us really car@@ es about .
How do you remember your other project Man@@ other Love B@@ one ?
I think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing .
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of An@@ dy ( Andrew W@@ oods ) .
There were many frustr@@ ations because la@@ sted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bru@@ ce ( F@@ air-@@ weather ) and Gre@@ g ( Gil@@ more ) , who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that An@@ dy was and how he made ​ ​ me lau@@ gh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , lau@@ gh , talk about music and football and much more .
It was a remarkable man and we miss him .
The national band Las Rober@@ tas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica .
Is it true that you know its work , especially Ed@@ die V@@ ed@@ der , and that &apos;s why you chose it for the opening ?
Yes , the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most , so we &apos;re anx@@ ious to see what Las Rober@@ tas can offer live and should be very enter@@ taining .
Why do you always change the ly@@ rics of Y@@ ellow L@@ ed@@ better live ?
That is a question for E@@ d ( Ed@@ die V@@ ed@@ der ) , so I do not know .
He s@@ ings it and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind .
As a b@@ assist , what are your influences ?
There are so many .
Within the first that come to my mind are Ge@@ e@@ zer But@@ ler , John Ent@@ wi@@ st@@ le , C.@@ J. Ram@@ one , John Do@@ e , Paul Mc@@ Cart@@ ney , Ch@@ u@@ ck Du@@ k@@ owski ...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the b@@ assi@@ sts that I love .
How did Pear@@ l J@@ am succeeded to maintain gr@@ unge relevant despite of not being any longer a f@@ ad ?
I think all of us feel a bit dis@@ connected from the word gr@@ unge .
When I think of it , it remin@@ ds me of the bands I mentioned before , like Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey , Sound@@ garden , N@@ ir@@ v@@ ana and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , I think it &apos;s wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mu@@ d@@ hon@@ ey are making now music better than ever .
At first , your music had a dark@@ er content , and now has become more positive .
How do you explain this change ?
It &apos;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear ligh@@ ter , but there are songs like The End or Just Bre@@ a@@ the that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive .
With both , when E@@ d played them , I cri@@ ed when I heard them , and these songs are pro@@ found@@ ly dark .
I think that when you grow up and there was some trau@@ ma in your life and you lost a family member or friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me .
Also , I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark .

Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori was hosp@@ itali@@ zed again for medical tests
The ex President Alber@@ to Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori was hosp@@ itali@@ zed Tuesday in a public hospital in order to be evaluated for the loss of mus@@ cle strength that occurs in the legs , informed his family doctor .
Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori , 72 years old , who is sent@@ enced at 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government ( 199@@ 0-@@ 2000 ) , suff@@ ers from several ail@@ ments , including cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated four times and it is kept under control .
The con@@ gres@@ sman A@@ le@@ j@@ and@@ ro A@@ gu@@ in@@ aga , who is his personal physi@@ cian , told to Canal N of television that Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Ne@@ op@@ las@@ tic Dis@@ e@@ ases in order to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in his lower lim@@ bs .
A@@ gu@@ in@@ aga said that in his opinion Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori would be a candidate for getting the benefit of par@@ don on humanitarian grounds ; however , he said he did not want this because he knows he is innocent .
He had surgery four times for cancer of the tongue , has a weight loss of 18 ki@@ los to which other diseases were added such as severe ero@@ sive ga@@ stri@@ tis , pan@@ cre@@ atic c@@ yst@@ s , kid@@ ney stones , high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs , listed the doctor .
Fu@@ j@@ im@@ ori is in prison since September 2007 in the Police National Department of Special Oper@@ ations .
In April 2009 he was sent@@ enced to 25 years of prison for killing 25 people at the hands of a squ@@ ad of anni@@ hil@@ ation of the army that operated c@@ land@@ est@@ inely in the early years of his government .
Mu@@ j@@ ica tra@@ vels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an President José Mu@@ j@@ ica , and composed of several ministers and business@@ men , will begin this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to approach political issues in the region .
Mu@@ j@@ ica will meet next Wednesday his Mexican equal , Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political , commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Urugu@@ ay@@ ans living in Mexico , according to the schedule released by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Presidency .
The meeting between both pres@@ idents , in the city of Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara , will be &quot; favor@@ able for the exchange of information as regards the political issues between the two nations , &quot; as published the Presidency of the South American country on its website .
According to the local media , Mu@@ j@@ ica seeks to get Cal@@ der@@ on &apos;s support for Urugu@@ ay in the incident with France that aro@@ se when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy , included the South American country on a list of tax ha@@ v@@ ens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes .
In his speech , Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax ha@@ v@@ ens , a statement that caused the refusal of Urugu@@ ay and the call to consultation of its amb@@ ass@@ ador in the European country .
Mexico presi@@ des since November , the G20 , a group composed of the world &apos;s most powerful developed and emerging countries , and has in effect with the South American country since January this year , an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation .
The Urugu@@ ay@@ an government has attempted in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax ex@@ changing arrangements in order to leave the &quot; gra@@ y list &quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , composed of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation .
On the trade plan , Mexico and Urugu@@ ay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement ( FT@@ A ) that has increased the exchange of goods between both countries .
The mu@@ st@@ ach@@ io@@ ed pl@@ um@@ ber comes to be three-@@ dimensional with &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot;
Super Mario has fought ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly for over 25 years to save Princ@@ ess P@@ each from the evil cl@@ ut@@ ches of Bow@@ ser , but never before he had done this in three dimensions : in &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; he will fight for the love of the girl in ster@@ e@@ osc@@ op@@ ic technology .
The title , which arri@@ ves in the stores around the world this month , has been designed to exploit the features of the po@@ table console N@@ int@@ endo 3@@ DS , which allows playing in three dimensions without the need of using gl@@ asses .
&quot; Mario is the character who has to say how it should work the ster@@ e@@ osc@@ op@@ y without gl@@ asses , &quot; said the press head of N@@ int@@ endo in Spain , Om@@ ar Al@@ v@@ are@@ z , during the presentation of the game in Madrid .
Al@@ v@@ are@@ z said that &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; is &quot; the first video game of N@@ int@@ endo originally designed for this support , &quot; because until now successes like &quot; Star Fox 64 3D &quot; or &quot; Z@@ el@@ da : O@@ car@@ ina of Time 3D &quot; were adap@@ tations of existing titles .
N@@ int@@ endo spo@@ kes@@ man has claimed that , despite being in 3D , &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; is an &quot; accessible &quot; video game which allows enjoying a quick and flu@@ id game .
Al@@ v@@ are@@ z said that &quot; Super Mario 3D Land &quot; contains two games in one : the first part is &quot; simple &quot; to engage less skilled users .
Once past@@ ed , most experts will give a &quot; second round &quot; to the levels of the play , which this time , are more difficult .
In addition , the users can choose in real-time between &quot; D aggressive &quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action , but will need to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and &quot; not to succ@@ um@@ b optical illu@@ sions . &quot;
This inc@@ ur@@ sion of Super Mario in three dimensions represents also the return of the character to a portable console , fact that has not occurred since 2005 .
In this game N@@ int@@ endo win@@ ks to the fans of the series and repe@@ ats the successful formula of the previous games , the pl@@ um@@ ber with mu@@ sta@@ che will have to go through dangerous mined platforms in order to free pr@@ inc@@ ess P@@ each .
Although the player will find new movements , the surroundings , cost@@ umes and enemies and also a &quot; play@@ able &quot; Lu@@ i@@ gi .
Col@@ om guarantees Por@@ till@@ o &apos;s ex@@ tradition to the United States
President Al@@ var@@ o Col@@ om said on Tuesday that the ex@@ tradition process of the ex leader Al@@ fon@@ so Por@@ till@@ o has begun in order to respond in the United States of la@@ undering $ 70 million .
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of north country that claimed for Por@@ till@@ o to judge him there .
At a press conference , Col@@ om said that his decision is according to the independence of judiciary and executive powers , taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the ex@@ tradition .
He stated that during his mandate he did not &quot; put his hands &quot; in judicial decisions and accepted all ex@@ tradition proceedings he has ever known .
In addition to Por@@ till@@ o , Ser@@ gio Ru@@ ano Mar@@ ro@@ qu@@ in will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted for murder and serious injury , and Ed@@ gar E@@ stra@@ da Mor@@ ales and Vic@@ tor E@@ stra@@ da Par@@ edes , both for drug traffic .
What &apos;s done by Col@@ om represents an executive process after getting exhau@@ sted all legal and constitutional courts to prosec@@ ute the ex head of state between 2000 and 2004 .
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fif@@ th Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court ( CC ) , Por@@ till@@ o will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted once resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteed his human rights .
Por@@ till@@ o was acqu@@ itted of em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of Q@@ 120 million in the Def@@ ense Ministry when he was a president , which was the process that preced@@ ed the ex@@ tradition , but the Public Ministry appe@@ aled and re@@ opened the case .
Trin@@ i@@ jo@@ ve has helped 6@@ ,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to prevent the fall on the marg@@ ins of the society of un@@ trained young men
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trin@@ i@@ jo@@ ve is important : 6@@ ,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter .
To this there are added over a hundred jobs currently created ​ ​ for this social group .
The anniversary served to make a balance at a ceremony held in the old factory complex Fab@@ ra i Co@@ ats where attended over 300 people .
Trin@@ i@@ jo@@ ve was born in the neighborhood of Trin@@ it@@ at V@@ ella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education , no job , and drug problems or at risk of falling into margin@@ ality .
The yesterday celebration at Sant Andre@@ u gathered a large number of responsible entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collabor@@ ated with the association .
The diverse political representation , in the election time , showed the un@@ it@@ ary character of the work done by Trin@@ i@@ jo@@ ve .
Next to the president of the Gener@@ alit@@ at , Art@@ ur M@@ as , and his predecessor Jor@@ di Pu@@ jo@@ l , attended the ceremony the ex coun@@ sel@@ or of Socialist Education , Ern@@ est Mar@@ ag@@ all , and the ex lie@@ utenant of the may@@ or and current ec@@ o socialist Coun@@ c@@ il@@ man Ric@@ ard G@@ oma .
Also attended at the Fab@@ ra i Co@@ ats the actual Coun@@ sel@@ or for Social Wel@@ fare and Family , Jose@@ p L@@ lu@@ í@@ s Cl@@ eries and CEO of the social work of La C@@ ai@@ x@@ a , J@@ au@@ me Lan@@ asp@@ a .
He said Trin@@ i@@ jo@@ ve was born in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult , but added that the work done so far &quot; is a good base . &quot;
The president gave Trin@@ i@@ jo@@ ve as an example for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties .
&quot; The crisis is not new to the entity and the work done by it , &quot; he said .
An occupied farm where mac@@ ro parties were given was ev@@ acu@@ ated
The inv@@ aders had sei@@ zed 11 of the 13 floors of the building , Bal@@ mes , 51
The 12 occup@@ ants left the farm at noon yesterday without a fight
It seems that the night@@ mare lived by the neigh@@ b@@ ors resi@@ ding in 51 Bal@@ mes Street has come to an end .
T@@ welve people left volunt@@ arily yesterday at noon the property they were illegally occup@@ ying , and where they organized mac@@ ro parties that ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated the neighborhood , by court order without police intervention .
When the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to prevent a repeat of the situation .
&quot; From now on there will be an access control , &quot; said the manager .
The squ@@ at@@ ters , who had inv@@ aded 11 of the 13 floors of the building , the rest are inhabit@@ ed@@ - took all the wir@@ ing and part of the water , painted the walls and left resi@@ du@@ es of all kinds , especially alcoho@@ lic be@@ verage cans .
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties , which la@@ sted up to two days and ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated the ten@@ ants .
Next to the building there is a night@@ club , Bal@@ mes 51 , which has also been damaged .
The owner , Maria P@@ ant@@ in@@ at told to Europa Press that since the building was occupied her business went down 80 % .
The owner of the club says that the inv@@ aders of the farm made ​ ​ her an unfair competition , since they were selling drinks for three Euros , while in the club worth 10 .
In addition , the owner of the disc@@ o had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise , while , as she noted , the noise was not caused by customers of the club , but by the inhabitants of the squ@@ at and , above all , those attending the parties that were organized there , which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks , as the an@@ gr@@ y neigh@@ b@@ ors said .
The head of the club said that the dis@@ comfort was so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and there are now nine months since she &quot; for@@ gives &quot; him for paying the rent .
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neigh@@ b@@ ors about the situation .
The chairman of the PP municipal group , of the council Alber@@ to Fern@@ án@@ dez D@@ í@@ az , had claimed last week &quot; to immediately ev@@ acu@@ ate the building in order to solve the problems of co@@ existence and community spirit caused to neigh@@ b@@ ors , and the degra@@ dation of the area . &quot;
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied , but over the last few months the squ@@ at@@ ters had entered into all floors and in almost every floor and that in some of them occurred bur@@ gl@@ aries .
In this sense , he added that &quot; it is necessary to put an end to imp@@ unity and to be strongly against the in@@ civili@@ ty that has been generated on the farm . &quot;
Also yesterday , the members of the police ev@@ acu@@ ated a building in N@@ ou Bar@@ ris .
At 15 : 30 the police went to 35 Mon@@ tr@@ al Street after receiving a call from a neigh@@ bor who had noticed that four people had entered the building .
The four were arrested at the time .
Park or mountain ?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversi@@ es over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors re@@ opened the debate on the role of Coll@@ ser@@ ola in Barcelona
In mid 80 &apos;s at the height of the now ext@@ inc@@ t Metro@@ politan Corporation of Barcelona ( M@@ C@@ B ) , this Administration printed promotional le@@ af@@ lets of Coll@@ ser@@ ola .
The book@@ let defined the mountain as the great park of the metro@@ politan Barcelona .
Moreover , it was accompanied by a comparison , in figures , with the New York Central Park .
On the death of the M@@ C@@ B , in 1987 , the park was placed again in the minds of many , as the upper limit of Barcelona , ​ ​ being the Catal@@ an capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north-@@ south but up ( mountain ) -@@ down ( sea ) .
The classification of Coll@@ ser@@ ola as a natural park re@@ do@@ unds in this idea .
The reference was not Central Park , but Y@@ el@@ low@@ stone , with the wild bo@@ ar on the role of Yo@@ gi Be@@ ar .
This was all about until , in September , the council called for a m@@ ega competition composed of 16 cont@@ ests for as many other doors to Coll@@ ser@@ ola .
A door refers to the idea of the park , no doubt .
Ei@@ ther that or someone wants to put gates to the field .
The question comes alone : Coll@@ ser@@ ola ? Park or mountain ?
The competition , both as for its merely organiz@@ ational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona .
It &apos;s almost a recur@@ rent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lin@@ e@@ age of elected persons recognize themselves in an elev@@ ator .
And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few simil@@ arities between what three architects of Barcelona are saying and the academ@@ ics , which have been presented .
Miguel Rol@@ dan , Daniel Mod@@ olo and Mar@@ a Bay@@ ona : the competition is appropriate
For Rol@@ and , after approaching the coastline becomes &quot; necessary &quot; to discuss about &quot; the mountain front , &quot; whenever Il@@ def@@ ons Cer@@ da &apos;s speech , that of green ap@@ ples has not been carried out .
&quot; It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach .
Among other things , for its great accessibility .
Coll@@ ser@@ ola is more complex , &quot; says the architect to whom the title of &quot; gates of Coll@@ ser@@ ola &quot; contains a &quot; lex@@ ical tra@@ p &quot; : we should not think about them &quot; as access to a park , but as the del@@ im@@ itation of some areas where we must act . &quot;
Mod@@ olo , as Rol@@ and and Bay@@ ona with experience in the urban world , called the proposal &quot; intellectual challenge &quot; with &quot; some dangers . &quot;
H@@ az@@ ards arising from the &quot; uncertainty of proj@@ ecting the public space &quot; after the experience of the 80 &quot; s which had in the Forum area &quot; his s@@ wan song . &quot;
The first fear is the own del@@ im@@ itation of the borders where to build .
&quot; Lim@@ iting something is setting up the next step , &quot; meaning , over@@ coming .
&quot; We must think of new urban planning tools , because the current &#91; in reference to the General Metro@@ politan Plan ( GM@@ P ) &#93; can lead to a real disaster . &quot;
Ti@@ ghter to the question , Mod@@ olo believes that simpli@@ fying the Coll@@ ser@@ ola valley side &quot; can be understood as a park , Barcelona , ​ ​ not &quot; by a purely top@@ ographi@@ cal issue .
Mod@@ olo rem@@ embers that there is already a work done by the Board of Coll@@ ser@@ ola that &quot; should not fall on de@@ af ears , &quot; although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project &quot; from the very beginning . &quot;
And further , understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate , but &quot; he doubts &quot; about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multi@@ disciplinary teams ( &quot; a success , &quot; he points ) that have had to create : &quot; The architects should be only a tool . &quot;
Bay@@ ona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex , because the contest rules lack a global view of Coll@@ ser@@ ola : &quot; 16 cross cont@@ ests have been called -@@ he s@@ ay@@ s-@@ on se@@ a- mountain sense , but there is no long@@ itu@@ din@@ al reading , to see and understand the area as a whole . &quot;
This leads , at least in this case , to have chosen to participate in the 16 cont@@ ests .
Otherwise , a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate .
In your opinion , the council should ensure that the band immediately above the Ron@@ da de D@@ alt should provide in its enti@@ re@@ ty , an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .
Casino for@@ gives Jon@@ as Lar@@ ra@@ zab@@ al and this one will be free
After 72 days of arrangements , the legal representative of the Red Casino for@@ gave the brother of the may@@ or of Monter@@ rey of the process against him for alleged ext@@ or@@ tion
After spending 72 days in j@@ ail , Manuel Jon@@ as Lar@@ ra@@ zab@@ al will be free after the legal representative of the Red Casino granted him for@@ gi@@ veness before the Second Criminal Court District , which follows a process of black@@ mail against the brother of the may@@ or of Monter@@ rey .
After the bom@@ bing of Casino Roy@@ ale , Red Casino owner , Ser@@ gio G@@ il Gar@@ cia , made ​ ​ public a series of photographs and videos where alle@@ ge@@ dly Manuel Jon@@ as required him to pay an economic fee so that the city hall of Monter@@ rey allows the c@@ land@@ est@@ ine operation of the bet house .
After the public condemnation , the State General Att@@ or@@ ney opened a criminal case against the may@@ or &apos;s brother and on September 2nd , he was arrested and impris@@ oned for 30 days .
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry for Heritage Cri@@ mes , he was transferred to the Tem@@ porary J@@ ail , located in the Old Neigh@@ bor@@ hood of the state capital .
In this place he remained for 49 days following the pron@@ unci@@ ation of a second restriction order after the prosec@@ utor dis@@ missed the crimes of bri@@ ber@@ y and organized crime .
On October 19th he was transferred to Ca@@ der@@ ey@@ ta alle@@ ge@@ dly for black@@ mailing with a half million of p@@ es@@ os the owners of Red Casino , but he stayed there only a few hours in the medium-@@ security prison because there were death threats against him .
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells boarding San Nicolas of Gar@@ za .
On October 25@@ th he an arrest order was issued by the c@@ ler@@ k of Second Criminal District Court , Jor@@ ge Y@@ ane@@ z , who said that after nearly two months of in@@ quiries there was enough evidence to establish the gu@@ ilt of Jon@@ as , such as the collection of 1.5 million p@@ es@@ os from the representatives of the book@@ maker in exchange for allowing the operation of it .
On Monday , the legal representative of Red Casino , Vic@@ tor Al@@ do Gar@@ cia Gom@@ ez , appeared before the judge José Lu@@ is P@@ ec@@ ina to seek par@@ don for the regional may@@ or &apos;s brother , so that in the coming hours he might reg@@ ain his freedom .
During the legal di@@ ligence , the public prosec@@ utor attached to the Court , Ram@@ ir@@ o Ari@@ as , ques@@ tioned Gar@@ cia Gom@@ ez whether he had re@@ paired the damage and which of the partners of the betting house granted par@@ don , although the lawyer tried to reserve the name .
Based on the record 19@@ 7 / 2011 legal par@@ don is granted to Jon@@ as Lar@@ ra@@ zab@@ al and there@@ after there may not be made ​ ​ any claim about the process that was intended against him ; also no damage repair or punishment will be required .
After the hearing of the legal representative of the book@@ mark@@ ers , at almost 15 : 50 it was ordered the immediate release of Lar@@ ra@@ zab@@ al Bre@@ ton .
The c@@ ler@@ k of the court , Jor@@ ge Y@@ ane@@ z , went to the j@@ ail of the municipality of San Nicolas of Gar@@ za to notify Jon@@ ah that he has been legally par@@ don@@ ed and his record will be filed .
Also he will notify him about the immediate release order issued by the judge .
The Secretary Di@@ on@@ isi@@ o Per@@ ez Jac@@ ome gives details of the crash where the Inter@@ ior Minister , Francisco Bl@@ ake , and seven others died .
The Ministry of Communications and Transpor@@ tation ( M@@ C@@ T ) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the Inter@@ ior Secretary Francisco Bl@@ ake Mor@@ a , and seven others died , indicate that the helicop@@ ter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity , without the pilot attempting a forced landing .
During a press conference , Di@@ on@@ isi@@ o Per@@ ez Jac@@ ome , Minister of Communications and Transport , said that before the aircraft took off , the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight .
&quot; The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the bla@@ des came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the f@@ us@@ el@@ age . &quot;
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .
He also said that the investigations made ​ ​ in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .
&quot; In a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place , the impact is presented in a structural way .
&quot; The design of the helicop@@ ter conceived for 19 passengers , fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transpor@@ ting passengers .
The land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees .
For now , the secret@@ ary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year .
Meanwhile , Gil@@ ber@@ to L@@ op@@ ez Me@@ yer , general director of Air@@ ports and Au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary Services , said that at the time of the impact , the Presi@@ denti@@ al helicop@@ ter was operating in cru@@ ising speed and that this happened in a soft as@@ c@@ ending land .
&quot; This information rein@@ forces the hypo@@ thesis of a normal cru@@ ise operation at the time of the impact , &quot; he said .
At the press conference , the owner of the SC@@ T , Per@@ ez Jac@@ ome , listed six important elements in the investigation :
Visual flight :
According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
We@@ ather Conditions :
A@@ IC@@ M reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clou@@ ds at low al@@ ti@@ tudes .
Sel@@ ected routes :
It is likely that due to cl@@ oud conditions the crew has search@@ ed an area of lower elev@@ ation and greater visibility into the valley of Cu@@ ern@@ av@@ aca .
Location of the impact .
The coordin@@ ates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft ra@@ dar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .
Dis@@ per@@ sion of w@@ reck@@ age on a small area :
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and later@@ al line .
The disp@@ er@@ sion of the w@@ reck@@ age suggests that the helicop@@ ter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity .
There was not detected evidence of fire or explosion :
On the area of the accident there remains un@@ disclos@@ ed evidence in the w@@ reck@@ age of the craft , some kind of explosion or fire .
Rec@@ ent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground .
During the field work there have been found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9.@@ 200 feet above mean sea level , the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees .
The pictures show the sequence in which it dismant@@ led along that journey .
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicop@@ ter may have had multiple imp@@ acts with the ground .
After a thorough research in a wider area than the sur@@ rendered off area , near the place the accident took place , there have not been found sc@@ attered pieces of the aircraft , which strength@@ ens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .
MS@@ S announ@@ ces a protocol for finding o@@ bes@@ ity gene
Social Security direc@@ ts a research to find the gene for o@@ bes@@ ity in children and young people ; it is supported by specialists from the IP@@ N
The Mexican Social Security Institute ( M@@ SS@@ I ) has announced that conduc@@ ts a research to discover the gene for o@@ bes@@ ity in children and young people , called the protocol of &apos; Gen@@ e@@ tics of o@@ bes@@ ity in childhood and ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence &apos; , which will provide counting on mark@@ ers associated with over@@ weight .
In a statement , the head of the Medical Research Unit in Bio@@ chem@@ istry of Speci@@ alties Hospital , XX@@ I Century National Medical Center , Miguel Cruz L@@ op@@ ez , explained that it was integrated a multi@@ disciplinary team of physi@@ cians , nur@@ ses , nutri@@ tion@@ ists and social workers .
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health ( N@@ IP@@ H ) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies ( C@@ invest@@ av ) National Poly@@ techni@@ c Institute ( N@@ P@@ I ) .
The research invites the population entitled or not , to participate by going to the participant sport units of the M@@ SS@@ I in the Valley of Mexico , where there will be carried out the tests to children , every Saturday from 8 : 00 o &apos;@@ clock .
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cu@@ au@@ ht@@ é@@ mo@@ c sports unit ( West Mexico State ) and since October 8th , the activity takes place in the Netz@@ ah@@ u@@ alco@@ y@@ ot@@ l Sport unit ( East State of Mexico ) .
Once reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children , the study will continue in the In@@ dependence Sport Unit ( South the Mexico City ) and finally in the Mor@@ el@@ os Sports Unit ( North the Mexico City ) .
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of gene@@ tics in relation to the development of o@@ bes@@ ity and identify in children and young Mex@@ ic@@ ans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic de@@ gener@@ ative diseases .
On November 14th , there will be celebrated the World Di@@ abetes Day , and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years , with the consent and par@@ ental supervision for the implementation of specific question@@ n@@ aires on food .
They will also be asked about physical activity and family her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary history of disease , in order to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as di@@ abetes or kid@@ ney failure .
He explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied an@@ throp@@ om@@ etric measurements ( weight , height , and wa@@ ist circum@@ ference ) , blood pressure measurements , and determination of glu@@ co@@ se , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ des , ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol and in@@ su@@ lin and genetic ( seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood o@@ bes@@ ity ) .
Cruz L@@ op@@ ez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .
Health Sur@@ ve@@ ys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 77 percent were o@@ bes@@ e , and 47 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of over@@ weight there was also observed a dramatic rise , &quot; said the specialist of the M@@ SS@@ I .
He said the justification for searching the mark@@ ers is based on that the population of the country diff@@ ers from other in its genetic history .
He reported that on average , the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage , 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with di@@ abetes and over@@ weight .
He explained that generally , the gene@@ tics of o@@ bes@@ ity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consu@@ me ( cal@@ ories ) and which is stored as fat .
The resear@@ cher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of over@@ weight or o@@ bes@@ ity .
Even , he said , the presence of dark@@ -@@ col@@ ored fol@@ ds ( ac@@ an@@ th@@ uses ) on the neck and for@@ ear@@ m indicates the lik@@ el@@ ihood of suffering of met@@ abo@@ lic dis@@ orders and even pre@@ di@@ abetes .
The information is handled with confidentiality , doctors deliver it in writing to the parents , to whom they explain each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease .
Cruz L@@ op@@ ez explained that there are three major components that cause over@@ weight , o@@ bes@@ ity and other chronic diseases : sed@@ entary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .
Also it is due to the high cal@@ or@@ ic in@@ take , meaning , and the increased consumption of sug@@ ary drinks , car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate ( tam@@ ales , bread , p@@ izza , ham@@ burger , etc . ) with high fat and protein and gene@@ tics analy@@ zed in this protocol .
UN@@ AM asp@@ halt would avoid poth@@ ol@@ es
Raf@@ ael Herr@@ era , a resear@@ cher at the Fac@@ ul@@ ty of Chem@@ istry of UN@@ AM , develops poly@@ mer@@ -@@ modified asp@@ halt to produce a mixture with the best performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand poth@@ ol@@ es every ra@@ iny season in the Metro@@ politan Area of Valley of Mexico , said Raf@@ ael Herr@@ era Na@@ j@@ era , a resear@@ cher at the Chem@@ istry Fac@@ ul@@ ty ( C@@ F ) of the UN@@ AM , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asp@@ halt p@@ av@@ ement is adequate , the poth@@ ol@@ es could be reduced or even completely eliminated .
In his lec@@ ture A technological view of the poth@@ ole , issued under the International Year of Chem@@ istry , announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a poly@@ mer modified asp@@ halt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asp@@ halt , but with a better mechanical strength , both at high and low temperatures .
Herr@@ era N@@ á@@ j@@ era said that this type of modified asp@@ halt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities in the north , to improve its performance and , therefore , the formation of poth@@ ol@@ es .
He explained that the asp@@ halt , the heavi@@ er oil part is a set of hydro@@ carbon molec@@ ules , some of high molec@@ ular weight , called asp@@ halten@@ es , and other of low molec@@ ular weight , called mal@@ ten@@ es , which together give the road surface its vis@@ co@@ el@@ astic characteristic behavior .
The vis@@ co@@ el@@ astic behavior of the asp@@ halt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees , it beh@@ aves like a liquid at 120 ° C , its vis@@ co@@ sity is very high and at 50 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asp@@ halt becomes fragile , he said .
This means that the resistance of the street asp@@ halt is not uniform , but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering .
C@@ F resear@@ cher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible p@@ av@@ ement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asp@@ halt .
Among the most super@@ ficial layers is the asp@@ halt , composed of small stones di@@ pped into the asp@@ halt and then comp@@ acted .
Each of the stones which com@@ pose this covering , he said , is di@@ pped with asp@@ halt .
When driving vehicles and generating effort , it allows the forces to spread very well on the p@@ av@@ ement .
If it were modified asp@@ halt it would spread even better , said the chemical engineer .
On the asp@@ halt covering , he added , is placed a final layer called rolling covering , which is made ​ ​ of a fine stone material , meaning sand also di@@ pped into the asp@@ halt .
Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asp@@ halt covering and provide road fri@@ ction .
As being the part of the p@@ av@@ ement that will receive and diff@@ use the efforts , the rolling covering also requires proper thick@@ ness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration .
The weather , especially hum@@ idity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it greatly affects the performance of the asp@@ halt .
When the ground is wet , water diff@@ uses inside the covering and it &apos;s hard to get out , this causing a sof@@ tening of all layers of the p@@ av@@ ement and , therefore , the formation of poth@@ ol@@ es .
In the formation of a poth@@ ole , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asp@@ halt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs .
Also a member of the National System of Res@@ ear@@ chers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of poth@@ ol@@ es and , therefore , the thick@@ ness of each layer of the p@@ av@@ ement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment , in order to prevent the frequent formation of poth@@ ol@@ es .
Raf@@ ael Herr@@ era said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asp@@ halt , for example , asp@@ halt em@@ ul@@ sions , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair poth@@ ol@@ es with eas@@ iness and without using high temperatures .
What did the candidate of Valley lack to be the new Mis@@ s Colombia ?
Analy@@ sis of the factors that affected S@@ ern@@ a Mel@@ ina Ram@@ i@@ rez for not getting the cro@@ wn of Mis@@ s Colombia .
The Valley gets its title number 14 of pr@@ inc@@ ess .
Once again Cau@@ ca Valley remains with the desire of the cro@@ wn of Mis@@ s Colombia .
This time Mel@@ ina Ram@@ i@@ rez S@@ ern@@ a had to be content with being on the winning po@@ dium , wearing the silver cro@@ wn and the band that acc@@ redi@@ ted her as the new pr@@ inc@@ ess of Colombia .
With the result obtained last night in Cart@@ ag@@ ena , where Mis@@ s Atlantic won the cro@@ wn and scep@@ ter , the department counts with 14 Princ@@ ess titles and Mel@@ ina jo@@ ins the leg@@ ion of women of Valley of Cau@@ ca who have been close to the cro@@ wn but were proc@@ laimed pr@@ inc@@ esses , among them Mi@@ ri@@ am O@@ sp@@ ina Ben@@ o@@ it ( 1947 ) , Clar@@ a Bor@@ r@@ ero Dom@@ ingu@@ ez ( 1949 ) , Patri@@ cia Bell@@ ini Ay@@ ala ( 1979 ) , Lor@@ ena Á@@ lv@@ are@@ z ( 1981 ) , Rose Mary Alz@@ ate ( 1983 ) , Ol@@ ga Maria Ar@@ en@@ as ( 1987 ) , Lei@@ la Blan@@ que ( 1988 ) , Mon@@ ica E@@ vers ( 1989 ) , Maria Consu@@ ela Pin@@ edo ( 1990 ) , Di@@ ana Is@@ abel Rom@@ ero ( 1993 ) , G@@ is@@ elle Al@@ j@@ ure Garc@@ és ( 2000 ) , Catal@@ ina Gir@@ al@@ do ( 2007 ) , Steph@@ an@@ ie Garc@@ és Al@@ j@@ ure ( 2008 ) .
Now the big question many are asking is :
What was missing ? Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Mis@@ s Colombia , not in v@@ ain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jo@@ lie F@@ ace of Vo@@ gue , titles that were obtained by que@@ ens as Tali@@ ana Var@@ gas or Nat@@ alia Nav@@ ar@@ ro , who took the cro@@ wn of Mis@@ s Colombia .
The first key factor in the decision of the jury to design@@ ate her as First Princ@@ ess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question &quot; &apos; What is the book that has marked you and why ? A@@ sk@@ ed ​ ​ by Martin Mur@@ ill@@ o Gom@@ ez from the Liter@@ ary C@@ art Let &apos;s read .
To the question@@ er she answered
&quot; I read a lot , I believe a lot in literature , I think it is a form of cultur@@ alization , and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is &quot; The little Prince &apos; is a pretty deep book .
Today I read &quot; Cri@@ me and Pun@@ ishment &apos; it is a book of universal literature that we all should read ; and now I &apos;m reading the book by Ir@@ ene N@@ emi@@ rov@@ ski , a Russian , a beautiful book called &quot; The heat of blood . &apos;
A response that the jury did not like due to the term &quot; cultur@@ alization &apos; and second of all for not specifically expl@@ aining how each of the c@@ ited books have marked her .
But after the ceremony Mel@@ ina said she was calm and happy with the result &quot; the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen . &quot;
And for you all , please read a little bit , &apos; The Little Prince &apos; it is a great book &quot;
Among the launched hypo@@ thes@@ es it is said that Valley got bur@@ ned by favor@@ i@@ tism .
A re@@ porter from B@@ og@@ ota suggested that for being the preferred , the acc@@ laimed , and the candidate who received all preliminary awards ( O@@ ster food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional cost@@ ume , and M@@ other Queen ) , &quot; that ar@@ ous@@ ed the je@@ al@@ ous@@ y of the other candidates , stressed the qu@@ een and therefore she did not shine on stage .
And that was noted in her first appearance in swi@@ m@@ suit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening cor@@ on@@ ation .
Although in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lack@@ ed the strength and energy that Mag@@ dal@@ ena and At@@ l@@ án@@ tico representatives did show .
Ari@@ el Os@@ orio , a journalist of the program &quot; Like home &apos; , of the R@@ C@@ N channel said that the fact that Mel@@ ina was designated as pr@@ inc@@ ess &quot; means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the qu@@ een . &quot;
In addition , Valley lat@@ ely avoided talking to the press , and that was wrong .
Another hypo@@ thesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Con@@ test .
This is why , two days before the election the international jury Lu@@ cy Dou@@ ghty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
&quot; Beauty is not enough for a Mis@@ s Colombia , we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , &quot; she said .
There is also a speculation that Valley sinn@@ ed for her defects on the post@@ erior and the fi@@ bro@@ sis that could be seen on her ab@@ d@@ omen , but it is contradic@@ tory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate &apos; natural beauty &apos; with the health@@ ier body , good nutrition and responsible physical work .
The coach of the que@@ ens Jor@@ ge Her@@ n@@ án O@@ ro@@ z@@ co recogni@@ zes that Mel@@ ina did not have the best body , that there were better , &quot; but the problem of fi@@ bro@@ sis on the ab@@ d@@ omen , which for me was not very notic@@ eable , made her lose points the last day . &quot;
Meanwhile , the journalist Gui@@ do Ho@@ y@@ os , of Cro@@ mos magazine considers that the error of the Valley of Cau@@ ca were the sur@@ g@@ ical interventions she suffered .
&quot; The sur@@ geri@@ es are fine , but Valley did not know how to do them .
Her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished .
For this award , which for the first time is given by the National Beauty Con@@ test , after the swi@@ m@@ suit par@@ ade a cru@@ el proph@@ ec@@ y was fulfilled last night , it was said that this was the fli@@ cker that R@@ ay@@ m@@ und@@ o granted to Mel@@ ina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the cro@@ wn .
Re@@ ality or not , the fact is that Mel@@ ina today begins a year of rei@@ gn , not as sovereign , but as a pr@@ inc@@ ess , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself .
However , she will go down in history as one of the que@@ ens that despite her overwhelming passage through Cart@@ ag@@ ena , found difficulties in getting the cro@@ wn .
Such was the work of the person who identified the body of Al@@ fon@@ so C@@ ano
A Cal@@ i l@@ opho@@ sc@@ op@@ ist entered into history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot; Al@@ fon@@ so C@@ ano .
The work of these officials is a key work .
On November 4th the l@@ opho@@ sc@@ op@@ ist of Cal@@ i CT@@ I passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the F@@ ARC top leader , &quot; Al@@ fon@@ so C@@ ano , through the comparison of his finger@@ prints .
Of the seven l@@ opho@@ sc@@ op@@ ists working in the branch of CT@@ I , this week it was the turn of &quot; availability &apos; for Ele@@ az@@ ar Gonz@@ al@@ ez , a man of Puerto Te@@ j@@ ada , who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation .
At the beginning of his career , Gonz@@ al@@ ez worked in municip@@ alities of Cho@@ c@@ ó , where he often had to go for more than five days in the jung@@ le to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified .
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and , after making the corresponding courses , he specialized in l@@ opho@@ sc@@ op@@ y , which is the study of skin fri@@ ction , meaning the pal@@ ms of the hands and feet .
The week of Eli@@ az@@ ar &apos;s operation against ali@@ as Al@@ fon@@ so C@@ ano he was warned to take clothes only for three days .
Some@@ thing big was coming .
On Friday night he went from Cau@@ ca with a helicop@@ ter , to Pal@@ mir@@ a .
He knew he had to identify two cor@@ p@@ ses and one was susp@@ ected to be of the man who led the world &apos;s oldest gu@@ er@@ ri@@ lla , so they asked him to take the ten print card of Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Le@@ ón S@@ á@@ enz ( his real name ) .
However , when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was , he did not recognize him by his physical appearance ; it was very different from that seen in the media .
He was without be@@ ard , dres@@ sed as a far@@ mer of the area , without gl@@ asses and much th@@ inner .
But the prints do not lie .
Ac@@ companied by a G@@ alt@@ onian ma@@ gni@@ fying glass , ink , a p@@ add@@ le and a f@@ las@@ h@@ light , Eli@@ az@@ ar compared the finger@@ prints of the cor@@ pse with those of the card .
His eye did not fail him : it was &quot; Al@@ fon@@ so C@@ ano &apos; .
That same night , the man from Puerto Te@@ j@@ ada was asked to confirm the defense minister , Juan Carlos Pin@@ z@@ ón , that it was the top leader of the F@@ ARC .
In search of the finger@@ print
For a finger@@ print specialist from Si@@ j@@ in of Cal@@ i the recognition made ​ ​ by the President Juan Manuel San@@ tos to Ele@@ az@@ ar Gonz@@ al@@ ez in the press conference for the operation against &quot; C@@ ano &apos; , is very significant .
Many people do not know our work .
The finger@@ printing science is an exact science , without error , which can be key solution in solving crimes .
Apart from the identification of bodies , the finger@@ printing specialists support research for crimes like th@@ eft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured .
When captured , many criminals have f@@ ake cards or do not have papers .
We will take their finger@@ print and seek them in the database .
The resear@@ cher said that , in a case of th@@ eft , he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the th@@ ief had supported his hand on to take a safe full of je@@ wel@@ s and money .
&quot; The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print , but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the off@@ ender , who had participated in several rob@@ ber@@ ies &quot; he said .
The prints can also rule out or confirm susp@@ ects in murder cases .
They have recently found a dead man , with liqu@@ or bott@@ les around him .
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be susp@@ ected of the crime and , indeed , a print on the bottle matched .
Although this does not guarantee that it was the mur@@ derer , it places him it in the murder scene .
A finger@@ print expert of CT@@ I explained that in objects &quot; foot@@ prints are drawn with chemical or physical re@@ agents . &quot;
When they appear there is used a p@@ add@@ le or tape to lift them .
After that , the prints are sent to Asi@@ f , which is the criminal database , or at the Regi@@ stry .
&quot; The problem is that there are still many und@@ oc@@ um@@ ented Colom@@ bi@@ ans , &quot; said CT@@ I expert .
He clarified that not everything is as shown in CS@@ I television program .
Just as not everything that gli@@ t@@ ters is gold , not everything you touch turns into a foot@@ print .
However , if it can be used , the comparison is being made .
The &quot; an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; challenge the authorities in New York
H@@ und@@ reds of protes@@ ters were crow@@ ding round in front of Zu@@ cc@@ otti square to camp .
A part of the protes@@ ters listened to the e@@ vic@@ tion order and moved to a nearby park .
The members of the movement O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Wall Street challeng@@ ed on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court order , in the Manhattan Square where they were ev@@ acu@@ ated at da@@ wn when trying to occup@@ y another park of the Big Apple .
H@@ und@@ reds of protes@@ ters crow@@ ded round the Zu@@ cc@@ otti square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows &quot; the an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the e@@ vic@@ tion by occup@@ ying a park north the city where there have been made further arres@@ ts .
&quot; Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zu@@ cc@@ otti , and through peaceful si@@ t-@@ ins and demonstrations , &quot; said one of the spo@@ kes@@ men of the movement &quot; O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Wall Street , &quot; Mark Bra@@ y .
Bra@@ y explained that the response of the &quot; an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; to the ev@@ acu@@ ation of the camp issued personally by the may@@ or of New York , Michael Blo@@ om@@ berg , came to court , where Ju@@ dge Lu@@ cy Bill@@ ings issued an order prohi@@ bit@@ ing the forced ev@@ acu@@ ation of the place and allowing the demonstr@@ ators to remain camp@@ ed .
In addition , the &quot; an@@ gr@@ y persons &quot; proceed@@ ed to the occupation of a new park located at the conf@@ lu@@ ence of the downtown Canal Street and Six@@ th Avenue , near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , which connects New York and New Jer@@ sey , owned by the parish of Trin@@ ity Church .
At least for one hour they were able to occup@@ y the place , but then the police came and proceed@@ ed to arrest some of the protes@@ ters , although Bra@@ y could not confirm the precise number , while telling E@@ fe that he saw several journalists who were also hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ ed .
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camp@@ ed at that point , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to medi@@ ate with the police .
Meanwhile , Zu@@ cc@@ otti square , which is a priv@@ ately owned site , remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to examine the leg@@ ality of the ev@@ acu@@ ation of this morning .
Some of the protes@@ ters moved there were carrying and distribut@@ ing at that time copies of that court order and even they gave these copies to officers guar@@ ding the place , which led to &quot; some small confron@@ tations , &quot; said Bra@@ y , who claimed that some officers be@@ aten the demonstr@@ ators .
The court order prohi@@ bits the authorities to ev@@ acu@@ ate the members of O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Wall Street and enforce &quot; laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohi@@ bit demonstr@@ ators reg@@ ain access to the park with shops and other property used before . &quot;
Mayor Blo@@ om@@ berg told re@@ por@@ ters that , because of that court order , the city had suspended the re@@ opening of the public space and protes@@ ters were informed , however , that local laws do not allow them to re-@@ install with camping shops and sleeping bags .
The coun@@ c@@ il@@ man personally defended the ev@@ acu@@ ation of the Zu@@ cc@@ otti square carried out at da@@ wn , an operation in which about 200 arres@@ ts were made and this was decided so because protes@@ ters were &quot; viol@@ ating the law . &quot;
Blo@@ om@@ berg said he gave the order to ev@@ acu@@ ate the square because it was becoming &quot; a place where people did not come to protest , but to break the law and , in some cases , to do harm to others &quot; as &quot; Some businesses had received threats &apos; and neigh@@ b@@ ors fear@@ ed &quot; for the quality of life . &quot;
&quot; The ev@@ acu@@ ation of this morning was dis@@ gu@@ sting and shows that deep inside Blo@@ om@@ berg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers , &quot; added the spo@@ kes@@ man of the movement , who accused the may@@ or of &quot; dis@@ respect for the freedom of expression . &quot;
The responsible of &quot; O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Wall Street &quot; also indicated that they intend to organize &quot; great de@@ eds &quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commem@@ or@@ ate the last two months of protests , which began on September 17th .
P@@ am@@ ela Ander@@ son will be Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael B@@ ub@@ le and other prominent Canadi@@ ans , she will appear on the television program &quot; It &apos;s a Rus@@ sell P@@ eters Christmas &quot; on December 1st
The Canadian P@@ am@@ ela Ander@@ son has been the assi@@ stant of T@@ im Al@@ len in &quot; Home Impro@@ vement &quot; li@@ f@@ egu@@ ard in &quot; Bay@@ watch &quot; B@@ unny in &quot; Play@@ boy , &quot; the wife of rock musi@@ cian T@@ omm@@ y Lee and now , the act@@ ress and model is the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show at the Canadian television .
The private television channel C@@ TV announced today that Ander@@ son , along with the &quot; cro@@ oner &quot; ( ball@@ ad singer ) Michael B@@ ub@@ le and other prominent Canadi@@ ans , will appear on the television program &quot; It &apos;s a Rus@@ sell P@@ eters Christmas &quot; on December 1st , interpre@@ ting a very different Mary .
C@@ TV presented today images of the television show in which Ander@@ son , also known by the wide distribution over the internet of a porno@@ graphic home video where she appears together with her ​ ​ husband , the dru@@ mmer of &quot; Mö@@ t@@ ley C@@ rü@@ e , &quot; T@@ omm@@ y Lee , appears dres@@ sed as the Virgin Mary holding in a cri@@ b a d@@ oll depic@@ ting Jesus .
In the scene , P@@ eters , a well known Canadian com@@ edi@@ an of Indian origin who recently appeared as a present@@ er on the tour of &quot; My Viol@@ ent Tor@@ ped@@ o of Tru@@ th &quot; by Char@@ lie S@@ he@@ en appears as Joseph .
In addition to Ander@@ son and P@@ eters , the C@@ TV Christmas special show features the Canadian singer B@@ ub@@ le , who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argent@@ in@@ ean model Lu@@ is@@ ana L@@ op@@ il@@ ato , and he is not a stran@@ ger as regards the contro@@ vers@@ y .
Recently , B@@ ub@@ le called &quot; bit@@ ch &quot; the American Kim Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an during one of his concerts in New York .
Japan re@@ born after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5 % due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the down@@ ward spir@@ al that began in March
Since last March , the Japanese economy was par@@ aly@@ zed , still recover@@ ing from the devastating earthquake , resulting in a nuclear crisis , the worst catastro@@ phe suffered by the Ni@@ pp@@ on country since the Second World War .
The first estimates of Tokyo government regarding the material losses amoun@@ ted to $ 300@@ ,000 million , a blow that , despite the difficult global context , seems to have di@@ mm@@ ed .
After three consec@@ utive quarters of dec@@ lines , the Gro@@ ss Dom@@ estic Product data between July and September helped to turn the page , definitely : GDP increased by 1.5 % compared to the previous quarter and by 6 % in ann@@ u@@ alized rate .
The one recorded in the second quarter , for the Japanese the Fis@@ cal Year begins in March 2012 - represents also the fastest rhyth@@ m of growth from January to March 2010 .
The recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas dev@@ ast@@ ated by the earthquake and the following ts@@ un@@ ami .
In fact , companies increased their investment by 1.1 % ver@@ sus 0.@@ 9 % decline in capital expendi@@ tures which was observed from January to March , the first decline after six months of un@@ interrupted increases .
However , the true re@@ vul@@ sion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keyn@@ es@@ ian impul@@ se that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strength@@ en-@@ or re@@ buil@@ d-@@ infrastructure , using of gaps to grow from scrat@@ ch .
Japan has aw@@ ak@@ ened , especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption , which now represents 60 % of the Japanese GDP .
This variable clim@@ bed 1 % , driven by the increase of expenditure for cars , tra@@ vels and leisure activities .
The s@@ tig@@ ma of the yen
Tokyo has entru@@ sted to the internal market , when the y@@ en-@@ the Ni@@ pp@@ on currency has become one of the &quot; refuge values &quot; chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the U.S. , a privilege that weigh@@ s like a stone in the accounts of export companies .
With a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad , a serious sl@@ ap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups .
To@@ y@@ ota or Sony , for example , bl@@ amed the yen for their weak results between July and September .
As markets continue their si@@ ege of the peripheral countries of the EU , the Government of Yo@@ shi@@ hi@@ ko No@@ da does not lower the guard .
&quot; We must be vigil@@ ant to the risks that remain , such as the deterioration of some foreign economies , the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , &quot; said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy , Mot@@ oh@@ is@@ a Fur@@ u@@ ka@@ wa .
And indeed , the perspectives are not encouraging .
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development ( OECD ) said that most member countries showed in September clear signs of economic slow@@ down .
The indicator that anticip@@ ates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are s@@ lowing .
Since it fell four ten@@ ths to 10@@ 0.@@ 4 points , compared to 10@@ 0.@@ 8 in August .
The euro zone even fell below the average , which is at the level of 100 , since it rus@@ hed eight ten@@ ths up to 9@@ 9.@@ 13 points .
Athens feeds back the doubts
Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s said that adjustments will be approved , but conserv@@ atives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty re@@ inst@@ ated in the parks , Greece is still ent@@ ang@@ led in the ma@@ ze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis .
The feeling that the &quot; consent &quot; of the new transitional government of H@@ ell@@ ene comes imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts .
While the new prime minister , Lu@@ kas Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be under@@ estimated for applying them , the leader of the conservative New Democracy party , Ant@@ on@@ is Sam@@ ar@@ as , ensured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiter@@ ated his demand for new elections scheduled on February 19th .
&quot; The main task of this Government is implementing the decisions of the summit of October 26@@ th , &quot; Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s said yesterday when opening a parliamentary debate that it will cul@@ min@@ ate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive .
A package of 24 programs to boost employment , reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax ev@@ asion will be the first initiatives .
However , the message of Sam@@ ar@@ as does not clear the doubts about his position : &quot; We are committed to helping the transitional government , but we are not committed to anything . &quot;
The Conserv@@ ative leader was one step further in his pul@@ se to the EU and the IMF , the entities that must un@@ free@@ ze the 8@@ ,000 million that Athens urgently needed , and made ​ ​ clear he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments .
But the European Commission , still having a n@@ app@@ y ras@@ h by the impact caused by the all or nothing statement of the Pap@@ and@@ re@@ ou referendum , reiter@@ ated yesterday that its demand is clear : it will not un@@ lock the help if the new Government and the leaders of H@@ ell@@ ene major parties do not sign &quot; a written commitment without ambigu@@ ity and this as soon as possible . &quot;
The Economic Affairs spo@@ kes@@ man , Ama@@ de@@ u Alt@@ af@@ a@@ j , said the tro@@ ika inspec@@ tors would return &quot; very soon &quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot; what has to be done to pay the sixth tran@@ che &quot; of 8@@ ,000 million , although there is no definite date .
The Greek h@@ ank still has a thread for the moment .
Mr@@ s. Sofia : &quot; They are instruments of progress and hope &quot;
The qu@@ een highlights the &quot; dominant &quot; place in Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot; has achieved a prominent place worldwide in the role of Micro@@ finance . &quot;
Queen Sofia rec@@ alled yesterday that the country has become over the last two decades the second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation ; whose &quot; essence &quot; she said lies in being an &quot; instrument for social progress , justice and hope for a better future for all humanity , based on trust in human beings . &quot;
The Queen opened yesterday the Fif@@ th Global Micro@@ credit Summit in Vall@@ ad@@ oli@@ d with the belief that &quot; there is no doubt &quot; that such operations are &quot; absolutely essential &quot; to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015 , and , &quot; especially having as a goal hal@@ ving the volume of people living with less than a dollar per day , with this fix@@ ing the &quot; poverty line . &quot;
Spain is &quot; still working &quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries all over the world , and assumes the task with &quot; responsibility &quot; said Mr@@ s. Sofia , who hoped that the efforts and contributions origin@@ ated in the Summit , which will be held until Thursday , will &quot; ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people , and especially for women , &quot; the main beneficiaries of these loans .
There are &quot; many achievements &quot; and &quot; many challenges we are facing . &quot;
The Micro@@ credit Summit arises not only as a forum for debate , but also as a platform that promotes &quot; two basic goals . &quot;
Thus , His Maj@@ esty explained that she hopes that at the end of 2015 , 175 million poor families will have acc@@ eded to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immer@@ sed .
The impul@@ se for the creation of mic@@ ro credits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot; has followed the path started years ago &quot; by Mu@@ ham@@ mad Y@@ un@@ us , highlighted Mr@@ s. Sofia as an &quot; act of justice and recognition . &quot;
And she described the father of this tool as an &quot; admir@@ able ide@@ alist of the universal cause of the fight against poverty , &quot; whose work is known for 15 years , when the Queen went to Banglad@@ esh to find out in the field the policy of loans .
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in I@@ vor@@ y Coast in 1999 , Canada 2006 , and &quot; in all I have seen the continued evolution , &quot; said His Maj@@ esty , whose link with this project made her earn yesterday the title of the &quot; head of the family &quot; in Vall@@ ad@@ oli@@ d from the &quot; ban@@ ker of the poor . &quot;
Finally , the Queen Mr@@ s. Sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty .
&quot; Eth@@ ical imperative &quot;
Foreign Minister , Trin@@ i@@ dad Jim@@ é@@ nez , said that solidarity &quot; is an ethical imperative &quot; to every democratic state .
In this regard , she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom , as it is a &quot; continuing obligation . &quot;
Jim@@ en@@ ez found that micro@@ credit sup@@ poses &quot; a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradic@@ ating poverty , &quot; and now &quot; more than ever , &quot; the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let this fall as victim of adjustments .
For Spain , micro@@ credit is &quot; one of the main lines of development cooperation . &quot;
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation , Sor@@ aya Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , pra@@ ised the &quot; success &quot; to give &quot; trust &quot; to people &quot; excluded to whom all doors are closed , &quot; and the may@@ or of Vall@@ ad@@ oli@@ d , Francisco J@@ avier Le@@ on de la Ri@@ va , welcomed those present to a city that &quot; opens its doors caught by the spirit of solidarity . &quot;
CD@@ U intends to elect the European President by universal suff@@ rage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union ( CD@@ U ) on Monday 14 November , in Leipzig took place without any real problems arising for the Chancellor Angela Merkel , who is also President of the Christian Democratic party .
The future of Europe was not initially planned to be on the programme , but imposed itself in the autumn , in particular to satisfy the milit@@ ants who will be watching the government &apos;s policy on Greece today and perhaps that on Italy tomorrow ....
The motion on the prei@@ dency of the European Commission , tabled by the direc@@ torate , was adopted almost unanimously .
Out of 10@@ 01 deleg@@ ates , only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting .
The standing ov@@ ation lasting several minutes which they , Angela Merkel and then a few hours later , Wolfgang Sch@@ ä@@ ub@@ le , the very Europ@@ hi@@ le Minister of Finance , received at the end of their respective speeches , left no room for doubt .
The main idea of the Chancellor and of the motion , is em@@ bo@@ died in the s@@ logan &quot; the right response to the crisis is not less Europe , but more Europe . &quot;
Not only because Europe means peace , but because &quot; nine million jobs depend directly on the Euro . &quot;
For the Chancellor , &quot; the time has arrived for a break@@ through in Europe . &quot;
This could mean modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon , making it possible to strengthen the control by the European Union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the Eurozone , but this could also affect the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suff@@ rage &quot; in order to im@@ part a face to Europe . &quot;
This is , generally speaking , the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Sch@@ ä@@ ub@@ le .
Certainly , it is not prob@@ able that the Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ -S@@ even will rapidly agree to this solution ; Great Britain is opposed to it and the heads of CD@@ U think that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it .
But the mark@@ er is in place .
Similarly , the deleg@@ ates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each countr@@ y-@@ Member of the direc@@ torate of the European Central Bank according the size of its economy , which would clearly increase the weight of the German economy .
An@@ x@@ ious to calm the climate in her party , the Chancellor increased the number of her references to Kon@@ rad A@@ den@@ auer and to Hel@@ mut Koh@@ l , but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the &quot; small &quot; European countries , or of countries in difficulty , which are quick to critic@@ ise &quot; arro@@ g@@ ant &quot; Germany .
Although the motion on Europe de@@ votes a paragraph to the importance of &quot; Fran@@ co-@@ German friendship , &quot; Angela Merkel did not mention France .
Exc@@ ept when in a hole .
Rec@@ alling that two centuries ago , Leipzig was the scene of a bloo@@ dy battle .
In fact , it was one of the most hum@@ ili@@ ating defe@@ ats of the Napol@@ e@@ onic army .
What is sick leave fraud ?
After allow@@ ances , the UM@@ P and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave .
On 15 November , Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bor@@ deaux to visit a family allow@@ ances allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject , which has been recur@@ ring since 2007 , concerning the fight against social assistance fraud .
And to help this offensive st@@ em@@ ming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints , but which also forms part of the presidential re-@@ election campaign , the majority want to concentrate on sick leave .
First and foremost , with a view to budgetary economies , the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of unemployment benefit
Clearly , without the specific consent of the employ@@ er , an employee falling sick will lose four days &apos; pay equal to at least 15 % of his / her monthly income .
A measure , which threatens to ar@@ ouse anger , but which , according to Les Ech@@ os , would produce a saving of 280 million Euros .
And which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect , namely , the im@@ position on public employees of one day &apos;s wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave ( public employees have not hi@@ therto had to wait for the payment of benefit , as against a three days &apos; wait by private employees ) .
Now that these questions are being discussed , the majority are also rel@@ a@@ un@@ ching the subject of fraud , target@@ ing abuses linked to medical certificates .
&quot; The controls will become more rigid and in addition , if you are caught , you will have to rep@@ ay any non-@@ legitimate benefit received , &quot; warned X@@ avier Ber@@ tr@@ and on RT@@ L on Sunday 13 November .
As in other cases , the effects of the announcement appear a little dis@@ proportionate to the reality of medical certific@@ ate-@@ related fraud .
This has actually been monitored constantly since 2002 via political offen@@ si@@ ves , which have usually borne fruit .
The French are no si@@ cker than people elsewhere in Europe .
Let us first of all look at the national figures .
According to the Ca@@ isse nationale d &apos;@@ assurance mal@@ a@@ die ( CN@@ AM ) , over 23@@ 7 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006 .
According to l &apos;@@ Institut de Recher@@ che et de Docum@@ entation en Econom@@ ie de la Sant@@ é , the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 at 1@@ 1,@@ 3 thousand million Euros , was 5 % of total health expenditure .
Of this sum , 46 % concerned mat@@ ernity leave and accidents at work and 54 % sick leave benefit at 6,@@ 2 thousand million Euros .
And therefore represented 2,5 % of heal@@ th-@@ related expenditure .
The French spent an average of 14@@ ,5 days on sick leave in 2010 , compared with 17.@@ 8 days in 2009 , according to a study by Al@@ ma Consulting Group .
An average , which conc@@ eals certain diver@@ gen@@ ces ; another inquiry published in 2007 by the Mon@@ ster@@ .com career management site , showed that 75 % of the 40 000 French employees ques@@ tioned said that they had not taken any days of sick leave .
Another study , this time concerning si@@ ck@@ ness ins@@ ur@@ ances , states that in 2010 , 37 % of sick leave la@@ sted less than 8 days , 15 % 15 days to one month , 15 % from one to three months and 11 % la@@ sted longer .
Compar@@ ing these figures with those of their European neighbours , French employees are no more inc@@ lined to take sick leave than those in any other country .
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CN@@ RS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 , the global rate of absence from work in France ( for reasons of health or not ) fluctu@@ ated between 10 % and 11 % , compared with between 20 % and 28 % in Denmark , 15 % in the United Kingdom , or between 16 % and 18 % in The Netherlands .
S@@ ick@@ ness certific@@ ate-@@ related fraud is very low , compared with &quot; black &quot; labour .
As regards fraud , it is very low .
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 45 days .
In 2008 , out of 1,5 million controls , the CN@@ AM found that 13 % of the 28@@ 5 000 controls on short-term si@@ ck@@ ness certificates were &quot; un@@ justified , &quot; or too long , &quot; equal to 37 0@@ 50 cases .
In the case of systematically controlled certificates valid for more than 45 days , 11 % cases were found to be &quot; inappropriate or un@@ justified &quot; out of 1,@@ 2 million , equal to 13@@ 2 000 .
In total therefore , 16@@ 9 000 cases were &quot; un@@ justified , &quot; out of several million of employees issued with certificates .
A figure which represents very few cases , compared , for example , with the &quot; black &quot; labour figure .
According to the UM@@ P dep@@ uty Domini@@ que Ti@@ an , author of a report on the subject in June , this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million Euros annual tax short@@ fall , equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infin@@ itely higher than losses due to fraud .
Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s : Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy .
This was declared on Monday 14 November by the Prime Minister Lu@@ cas Pap@@ ad@@ é@@ mos in parliament , adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not long enough for the accomp@@ lish@@ ment of this task .
&quot; To pursue the efforts of rescu@@ ing the economy , we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment &quot; declared the head of government , who made his first public speech opening the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday .
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the Eurozone on 27 October shall be the &quot; principal task &quot; of the new government , because participation of the country in the Eurozone &quot; is at stake , &quot; he added .
Consequently , M. Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s forecast that the country &apos;s public deficit would be reduced to &quot; about 9 % &quot; of the P@@ I@@ B by the end of the year , after having been 10.@@ 6 % in 2010 and 15.@@ 7 % in 2009 .
The Right re@@ jects new austerity measures
On Monday , Ant@@ on@@ is Sam@@ ar@@ as , the leader of the Right , gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis , but warned that his party would not support additional austerity .
&quot; We will not vote in favour of new measures , &quot; he said at a meeting with the dep@@ u@@ ties of his New Democracy party .
He declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste , but also his opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery .
To Ol@@ li Reh@@ n , the European commission@@ er responsible for economic and monetary affairs , who warned that the F@@ M@@ I and the EU would not un@@ block the loan of 8 thousand million Euros required , without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the planned measures , Antonio Sam@@ ar@@ as rep@@ lied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure .
It is necessary to leg@@ alise eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assisted suicide , says a committee of experts
Canadi@@ ans are living half dead , according to a report of the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding p@@ alli@@ ative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible p@@ alli@@ ative care , apart from cancer cases .
Canadian society is half dead .
Only 9 % of Canadi@@ ans agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .
This is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada , in which six experts in different fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code , so as to permit assisted suicide and eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision .
At the outset , the experts c@@ ite a recent inquiry by the Econom@@ ist Intelli@@ gence Unit , which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide .
Whilst Canada is placed 10th , the study notes that &quot; the medic@@ alisation of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death .
Medic@@ alisation or not , 77 % of Canadi@@ ans do not have access to p@@ alli@@ ative care , report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada .
And 86 % of them end by dying in hospital
Coun@@ tr@@ y@@ wide , it is in Qu@@ eb@@ ec that the rate is highest , with 86 % of deaths taking place in hospital .
On the delicate question of eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the Federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assisted suicide .
Now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been leg@@ alised or de@@ crimin@@ alised , there is no proof that the aid de@@ crimin@@ alisation involves abuses of application , that is to say , the practice of eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not cons@@ enting .
On the contrary , affir@@ med during a telec@@ on@@ ference , J@@ oc@@ el@@ yn Down@@ ie , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assisted suicide have not been leg@@ alised .
&quot; Eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a is practi@@ sed in Canada , where it is clearly illegal . &quot;
&quot; Assi@@ sted suicide is practi@@ sed in Canada , where it is clearly illegal , explains J@@ oc@@ el@@ yn Down@@ ie .
Canadi@@ ans in favour of eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a
It should be remembered that 85 % of Canadi@@ ans are in favour of eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a , because according to an Ang@@ us Rei@@ d en@@ quiry in 2010 , they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to allevi@@ ate their suffering .
And the leg@@ alisation of eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handic@@ apped persons had less value .
Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosec@@ uted .
Regarding the continuation , or the withdrawal of nur@@ sing care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .
They also suggest among their other recommendations , that the pen@@ al code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nur@@ sing care is not criminal .
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nur@@ sing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosec@@ ution .
Regarding p@@ alli@@ ative care , the committee calls on governments , nur@@ sing institutions , and doctors to work together to provide the best possible p@@ alli@@ ative care and not only in cases of cancer .
Lastly , concerning p@@ alli@@ ative sed@@ ation already widely used in Canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and that it should be subject to the same procedures .
Reserv@@ ations of other experts
Cer@@ tain experts in the field of the heal@@ th-@@ related legislation have already voic@@ ed reservations concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts &apos; report .
Ma@@ î@@ tre Pierre Des@@ champ@@ s , a specialist in health legislation , described as &quot; extreme &quot; the position of the experts who signed the report , because among other things , it does not restrict the practice of eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a to terminal cases .
&quot; This opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old , could ask for help to commit suicide , says Me Des@@ champ@@ s , who yesterday consulted a summary of the report .
Me Des@@ champ@@ s also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
He says that &quot; in society there are sign@@ posts and constraints .
The specialist in health legislation , Margar@@ et Som@@ er@@ ville also expressed &quot; strong opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as being &quot; obviously pro-@@ eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a . &quot;
Margar@@ et Som@@ er@@ ville , who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada , cont@@ ests , in particular , the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where eu@@ than@@ asi@@ a and assisted suicide have been leg@@ alised as in The Netherlands and in O@@ reg@@ on .
The King of Jordan calls on president Ass@@ ad to rel@@ inqu@@ ish power
Dam@@ as@@ cus den@@ oun@@ ces a &quot; plot &quot;
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The parti@@ s@@ ans of B@@ ach@@ ar al-@@ Ass@@ ad demonstrated yesterday in front of the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Diplom@@ atic pressures intensi@@ fied yesterday on the Syria of B@@ ach@@ ar al-@@ Ass@@ ad , who , with the support of Russia , is resist@@ ing them and has den@@ ounced a &quot; plot &quot; against his country .
Two days after the suspension of Syria from membership of the Arab League , the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Dam@@ as@@ cus , whilst Syria &apos;s neighbours Turkey and Jordan , came out in favour of president Ass@@ ad &apos;s departure .
King Ab@@ d@@ all@@ ah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on president B@@ ach@@ ar al-@@ Ass@@ ad to rel@@ inqu@@ ish power in Syria , where some for@@ ty civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed .
&quot; If B@@ ach@@ ar had the interest of his country at heart , he would have to res@@ ign , but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of the political life , said the King of Jordan , a neighbouring country of Syria , in a BBC interview .
In his turn , the Turkish foreign minister , Ah@@ met Dav@@ ut@@ og@@ lu depl@@ ored the fact that Turkish efforts to medi@@ ate , which began at the start of the year , did not meet with success .
&quot; Those in the Middle East who are at peace with their people , but cannot satisfy their aspirations , will leave power , he said , all@@ u@@ ding to Syria , a neighbouring country , on which Turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line .
For their part , the United States are congratulating themselves on the increased consensus against Ass@@ ad and the actions of the Syri@@ an regime following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union .
&quot; The international community , the United States , the European Union , the Arab Leg@@ au@@ e , and countries such as Turkey , are adopting an increasingly harder line &quot; in the face of the the repression in Syria , observed Mark T@@ oner , a spo@@ kes@@ man of the State Department .
During this time , 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime die in the area of Der@@ a@@ a in the south of Syria , announced l &apos;@@ Ob@@ serv@@ ato@@ ire sy@@ ri@@ en des dro@@ its de l &apos;@@ h@@ omm@@ e ( OS@@ D@@ H ) .
Two other civilians died during exchanges of fire and heavy rif@@ les at J@@ ob@@ ar in the besi@@ eg@@ ed town of H@@ oms , according tot his ON@@ G .
During a Press conference , the Syri@@ an foreign minister W@@ ali@@ d Mou@@ allem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis . &quot;
He moreover re@@ acted strongly against the decision of the Arab League to suspend Dam@@ as@@ cus which according to him represents a &quot; dangerous step . &quot;
Syria will not bend , he added , ass@@ uring that pl@@ ots against Syria would fail . &quot;
After its decision to suspend Syria , the Arab League is at present studying &quot; a protection mechanism for civilians and wants the dispat@@ ch of 500 members of of Arab rights of man organisations , of media and of military observers into the country .
The French foreign minister Ala@@ in Ju@@ pp@@ é also declared himself in favour to the dispat@@ ch of UNO observers to help to protect civilians from repression by the regime , which according to him , is &quot; par@@ ano@@ id . &quot;
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow to debate the implementation of escape from the crisis decided on 2 November and fores@@ eeing in particular , the withdrawal of armed forces from the towns in dispute and the liber@@ ation of arrested demonstr@@ ators .
The Russian foreign minister , S@@ erg@@ y@@ ey Lav@@ ro@@ v , yesterday described as &quot; incorrect &quot; the decision of the Arab League , whilst China ex@@ hor@@ ted Syria to implement the plan of emerging from the crisis , taking care not to support possible sanctions against Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrific@@ es from Itali@@ ans
The future head of the Italian government , Mario Monti , has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and to implement a programme , which will involve &quot; sacrific@@ es , &quot; in order to recover credibility lost over the last few months of the Berlusconi government .
The former European commission@@ er was yesterday in discussions with the political parties before today &apos;s meeting with unions and employers
He will have to form a relatively moderate cab@@ inet composed of t@@ echno@@ cr@@ ats from outside parliament .
&quot; Monti spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacrific@@ es , &quot; said Franc@@ esco Nu@@ car@@ a , a dep@@ uty of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minist@@ er-@@ design@@ ate .
The president of the Chamber or dep@@ u@@ ties , Gi@@ an@@ fran@@ co Fin@@ i , said that he would wait to learn if Mario Monti would ask parliament for a vote of confidence between now and Friday , to as@@ certain whether the new government had enough support .
The consultations will end in the presentation by M. Monti of a limited list of a do@@ zen or so ministers to the head of State , Gi@@ or@@ gio Na@@ polit@@ ano .
M. Monti comm@@ ented on the ner@@ v@@ ousness of the stock@@ markets here , asking them for time .
In a &quot; democracy , time is needed for the preparation of a government and a programme , he stressed , adding that he was certain that the markets would be patient and understanding . &quot;
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets , but dis@@ quiet re-@@ emerged , in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in Eurozone in September .
The prime minist@@ er-@@ design@@ ate had to form a team , most importantly comprising t@@ echno@@ cr@@ ats , even though he stressed that he would also like to include &quot; politicians . &quot;
The new government would have to last until 2013 , the date of the next election , he said .
According to the president of the Chamber of dep@@ u@@ ties , Gi@@ an@@ fran@@ co Fin@@ i , the new government would secure the vote of confidence of parliament by Friday .
M. Monti under@@ took that once in office he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become a prot@@ agon@@ ist in Europe .
A spo@@ kes@@ man for the European Commissioner , Ol@@ li Reh@@ n@@ . stressed that &quot; regardless of a new government , our diagno@@ stic of the Italian economy has not changed . &quot;
The European Union , being convinced that Rome would not achieve its objective budget in 2013 despite the austerity plan adopted over recent months , has asked , in particular , for stringent new measures .
The Italian &quot; bo@@ ss of bo@@ ss@@ es &quot; Emm@@ a Mar@@ c@@ eg@@ ag@@ lia , who will meet him on Tuesday , has also insi@@ sted on the necessity of rel@@ a@@ un@@ ching the economy , &quot; because a country which does not have growth , cannot observe the parameters of deficit . &quot;
M. Monti , known for his competence and for his independence when he was European Commissioner ( 199@@ 4-@@ 2004 ) , represents a &quot; change of e@@ po@@ ch &quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot; ber@@ lus@@ con@@ ism , &quot; the &quot; professor &quot; symboli@@ sing &quot; the challenge of seri@@ ousness &quot; and &quot; another Italy , &quot; according to the lea@@ der@@ writers .
The great unknown is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of his team .
President Na@@ polit@@ ano would like to avoid an early election , because by April 2012 Italy must place State deb@@ entures worth 200 thousand million Euros .
A Russian scienti@@ st has assisted an Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scienti@@ st , V@@ y@@ ch@@ es@@ la@@ v Dan@@ il@@ enko , assisted Iran to develop a det@@ on@@ ator usable with a nuclear weapon , confirmed on Monday an American agency speci@@ alising in the field of atom@@ ic haz@@ ard .
The Institute of Science of International Safety IS@@ IS ) bases itself on the recent report from the International Atom@@ ic Safety Agency ( A@@ I@@ EA ) and other documents from this UNO agency , to identify this resear@@ cher .
Last week , A@@ I@@ EA announced its serious dis@@ quiet concerning a &quot; possible military dimension &quot; of the Iranian nuclear programme .
According to IS@@ IS drawing largely on A@@ I@@ EA documents , M. Dan@@ il@@ enko , born in 19@@ 34 , worked for 30 years from the &apos; six@@ ties on@@ ward , in a Soviet military nuclear centre in T@@ ch@@ eli@@ ab@@ ins@@ k ( Ur@@ al ) , and was involved in the manufacture by explosion of synthetic diam@@ onds .
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to establish a company producing &quot; nan@@ o-@@ diam@@ ants &quot; in K@@ iev .
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian emb@@ ass@@ y in Ukraine in 1995 .
He then co@@ operated on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 , before returning to Russia .
In its last report , A@@ I@@ EA men@@ tions &quot; strong indications that the development by Iran &quot; of a system of nuclear det@@ on@@ ation &quot; was ai@@ ded by the work of a foreign expert , who not only knew this technique well , but who also informed the Agency that he had worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin . &quot;
Anti-@@ Mos@@ lem crimes have increased by 50 %
Between 2009 and 2010 , anti-@@ Mos@@ lem crimes increase by almost 50 % , whilst during the same period other forms of ra@@ cial and religious violence had fallen slightly , or had not changed , according to F@@ B@@ I statistics published on Monday .
According to these figures , the total number of cases of violence against Mos@@ lem@@ s moved from 10@@ 7 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 , equal to an increase of 49 % , as against an increase of 13 % of cases of violence against Catho@@ lic@@ s , a fall of 4 % of attacks on Jews and a global increase of 14 % in anti-@@ religious crimes .
The global number of h@@ ate crimes increased very slightly to 6 6@@ 28 cases , of which 4@@ 7,@@ 3 % were motivated by ra@@ cial differences and 20 % by religious differences , according to F@@ B@@ I .
&quot; After a decrease in 2009 , it is distur@@ bing to see these crimes increasing again , stressed the rights of man organisation , Human Rights First , &quot; the increase of cases of anti-@@ Mos@@ lem violence is particularly significant , &quot; added the organisation in a comm@@ uniqu@@ é .
&quot; Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Mos@@ lem@@ s , as well as all forms of h@@ ate crime , must be regarded as serious violations of human rights , &quot; adds one of the managers of the organisation , Paul Leg@@ end@@ re .
&quot; The American government can and must do more to deal with his abuse , he adds , jud@@ ging that this could be due to the editing of police reports on h@@ ate crimes . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ate crime &quot; in Federal law , is a legacy from the period of struggle for civil rights .
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Lu@@ ther King to pun@@ ish acts of violence linked to race , colour of skin , religion , origin and now sexual orientation .
Twitter modi@@ fies its platform and res@@ emb@@ les Facebook
On Monday , the micro@@ blog site Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform , to allow its users , in particular , to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring , which makes its service res@@ emble that of Facebook .
A new tab &quot; activity &quot; and another &quot; name &quot; make it possible to follow more legi@@ bly and directly the activity of other &quot; T@@ wit@@ ters , &quot; the internet navig@@ ators whose messages are monitored ( &quot; t@@ we@@ ets &quot; ) and of those who monitor you .
This enables one to know if they cause messages to be monitored , if they subscribe new accounts , if they have favourite messages , etc .
This new Twitter formula was tested &quot; on a small percentage of users in August &quot; before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday , indicated a spo@@ kes@@ woman of Twitter , Carol@@ yn P@@ enn@@ er to AF@@ P .
Twitter , which has been known so far for being rather un@@ intuitive , and for its use of somewhat es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic terms ( R@@ T for re-@@ posting someone else &apos;s message , # follow@@ fri@@ day for recomm@@ ending following other users ) , much to the delight of experienced users , is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks Facebook and Google + .
On the network , users debated this innovation via &quot; t@@ we@@ ets &quot; on internet .
&quot; It is us@@ eless , inv@@ asi@@ ve and res@@ emb@@ les Facebook exc@@ essively &quot;

Austria
In@@ scri@@ ption of a budgetary &quot; golden rule &quot; in the constitution
The government of the great social democratic / Christian democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary &quot; golden rule &quot; into the constitution , in order to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible down@@ gra@@ ding by rating agencies of Austria &apos;s sovereign credit r@@ sting ( triple A ) .
It was the soci@@ al-@@ democratic Chancellor his elf , Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , who announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the council of ministers , with the Austrian public debt at 7@@ 4,@@ 6 % , much higher than the nor@@ m of a maximum of 60 % set by the treaty of Maastricht , but below the public debt of countries like Italy , Greece or Spain .
&quot; If the solven@@ cy of Austria had not fallen by a single not@@ ch , from A@@ AA to AA + , we would have to pay three thousand million Euros of interest more every year , &quot; argued the vic@@ e-@@ chan@@ cell@@ or and Christian democratic foreign minister , Michael Sp@@ in@@ deleg@@ ger .
Austria thus comp@@ lies with a request from the Brussels summit of m@@ ember@@ -@@ States of Eurozone on 26 October ; the heads of State and government requested a reduction by the end of 2@@ 10@@ 2 of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to the same effect .
The dis@@ positions adopted by the Austrian government approach the &quot; German model , &quot; being the first European country to adopt this &quot; rule . &quot;
By 20@@ 17 , the public structural deficit must fall by 0.@@ 75 % of the P@@ I@@ B ) and from 20@@ 17 , the structural public deficit of the Austrian Federal State must not exceed 0,@@ 35 % of P@@ I@@ B in any year , whilst the Länder , as well as communities , must submit balanced budgets .
The objective is that of making public debt fall below the 60 % criterion fixed by the treaty of Maastricht by 2020 / 20@@ 21 .
Yo@@ shi@@ ho@@ ko No@@ da
threatens fresh intervention on the exchange market
The Japanese prime minister , Yo@@ shi@@ hi@@ ko No@@ da , warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchanges market if the value of the yen continued to rise .
&quot; We would intervene as we did the last time , if we found excessive vol@@ atility in the rate of exchange of the yen , explained M. No@@ da to the Sen@@ ate .
On Tuesday , the yen rose to near historical levels , causing the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October .
On that date , Tokyo sold the yen against the dollar on a massive scale in order to cut the value of the Japanese currency , which was setting a new record of strength since 1945 .
But the yen had risen regularly since then , stim@@ ulated by purchases by investors who regard it as a &quot; shel@@ ter &quot; in these uncertain times of worldwide economic slow@@ down and the debt crisis in Europe .
On Tuesday , the dollar fell below 77 yen and the Euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen , close to levels which trig@@ gered the last intervention .
Pri@@ or to the financial crisis of 2008-@@ 2009 , the dollar was about 120 yen and the Euro over 160 yen .
This rise of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports , because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of Japanese firms from abroad , when converted into the national currency .
&quot; Japan is fighting to re@@ construct itself &quot; since the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami on 11 March , which dev@@ ast@@ ated the region of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ u ( north-@@ east ) , stressed M. No@@ da who fears that this rise of the yen does not kill the fragile embry@@ onic recovery .
The world &apos;s third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter -@@ 1,5 % compared with the previous quarter - for the first time for a year , thanks to a rise in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastro@@ phe .
But the prime minister felt that the high price of the yen did to reflect &quot; Japan &apos;s economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
The minister of finance , J@@ un A@@ zu@@ mi , called on the Bank of Japan ( Bo@@ J ) , which on Tuesday opened a two-@@ day meeting of its monetary policy council , to take every necessary step to weaken the yen .
But the dep@@ uty govern@@ or of the institution , Hi@@ ro@@ hide Yam@@ agu@@ chi , warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken steps the &quot; appropriate steps &quot; stating that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on Wednesday
Since its last meeting at the end of October , the issuing institution increased by 5.000 million yen ( 47 thousand million Euro &apos;s ) worth of treas@@ ury bond purchases , raising the ceiling to 5@@ 5.000 thousand million yen ( 5@@ 19 thousand million Euros ) , which it is de@@ voting to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market .
Eurozone :
the rates are climbing , the stock exchanges are wa@@ ver@@ ing
The risk of cont@@ ag@@ ion of the debt crisis is undermining European indi@@ ces .
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and in Italy and better growth figures in France and in Germany , the rates in fragile countries continue to rise .
Still worried about the stability of Eurozone , European exchanges have entered a little further into the negative area on this Tuesday 15 November .
In Paris , at 10 a.m. , the CA@@ C 40 lost 1,@@ 4 % to end at 3.@@ 0@@ 64 points .
The Da@@ x at Frankfurt fell 0,@@ 4 % and London 0,@@ 1 % .
&quot; With the new tensions about the yield of loans of Eurozone States in difficulties , the share markets worldwide con@@ tim@@ ue to lose a part of their recent gains . &quot;
&quot; Ner@@ vous investors are only too aware of the risk of cont@@ ag@@ ion , &quot; explains Terr@@ y P@@ rat@@ t , an institutional bro@@ ker at I@@ G Mark@@ ets quoted by Re@@ uter .
The Tokyo exchange closed with a fall of 0,@@ 7 % , suffering fresh doubts of market participants on the subject of the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis .
&quot; Japan , like the rest of the world has its eyes riv@@ eted on Europe and the exchanges will ch@@ ase one another in a corrid@@ or of narrow variations as investors will not have proof that the situation has stabili@@ sed , &quot; states Mit@@ sus@@ hi@@ ge Ak@@ ino , fund manager at I@@ chi@@ yo@@ shi Investment Management .
This re-@@ emergence of dis@@ quiet about the future of Eurozone pen@@ alis@@ es the single currency , which has continued to fall on Tuesday .
The Euro is reaching its lowest level for a month and a half .
T@@ ow@@ ards 10 a.m. the European currency is worth 1,@@ 35@@ 70 dollars , having fallen by 0,@@ 4 % .
According to bro@@ kers , it fell after the party of the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel , the CD@@ U meeting on Monday adopted a motion , envis@@ aging , in particular , the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the Eurozone without also leaving the European Union .
Italian and Spanish rates substantially above 6 %
The bor@@ rowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very dis@@ qui@@ eting levels .
This Tuesday morning the yield of Italian 10-@@ year deb@@ entures at@@ tained 6,@@ 85 % , that of Spanish ones of the same mat@@ urity date , 6,@@ 2 % .
These tensions of the rates of interest of southern countries , but also France , continue to feed the ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sions of participants .
The head of the future Italian government , Mario Monti asked the markets for time to restore the situation in an Italy threatened by as@@ ph@@ y@@ x@@ ia by the weight of its debt .
The new Greek prime minister Lu@@ cas Pap@@ a@@ demo@@ s affir@@ med that the implementation of decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be &quot; the principal task &quot; of his government .
Spain finds itself in the line of fire by the markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on Sunday .
The spread of the rate between 10-@@ year German and Spanish bonds has reached a new histor@@ ically high level .
A@@ waiting the growth figures of Eurozone
France has recorded an economic growth of 0,@@ 4 % in the third quarter , a little better than the expected 0,@@ 3 % , due to increased household consumption .
The In@@ seen nevertheless revised down@@ wards the figure for the second quarter , with a fall of 0,@@ 1 % of the gross internal product ( P@@ I@@ B ) instead of stag@@ nation .
And it is really the fourth quarter , which most dis@@ qui@@ ets the economists .
Germany for its part , ha recorded a growth of 0,@@ 5 % for the same period .
A first estimate in respect of the whole Eurozone is expected at 11 a.@@ m , the European Commission having warned against the risk of a new recession .
Energy policy :
F@@ acts must prevail over do@@ g@@ mas
If there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short-term considerations , or under the stress of emo@@ tion , it is energy policy .
The availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .
It is healthy that an electoral ren@@ de@@ z@@ vous should be an occasion for reflecting on such st@@ akes and the place occupied by nuclear power .
The debate will not be fruit@@ ful , unless it expl@@ ores all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
The French must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .
Now that we are 7 thousand million human beings on the planet , demographic development will involve a dou@@ bling of demand for electricity by 2050 , unless a huge proportion of the world &apos;s population is deprived of a vital element .
During the same period , it will become necessary to p@@ alli@@ ate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without for@@ getting the over@@ riding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight clim@@ atic im@@ balance , a subject which has van@@ ished from the ecological debate .
The Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accident does not modify any of these parameters .
This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to ren@@ ounce nuclear energy .
This is not the case of Belgium , which sub@@ ordin@@ ates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of Switzerland , which intends to build only the most modern ones .
On the other hand , Great Britain , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India , Brazil to quote only a few , pursue their projects with determination .
The United States , decided after Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma to add a unit to their range by resum@@ ing the construction of a centre , which was interrupted after the Three Mi@@ le Island accident .
Although the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradi@@ cts that argument .
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an increased energy dependence ag@@ grav@@ ated by increased re@@ course to imported gas , in particular from Russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .
In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt .
The case of Denmark should be considered .
Champion of Europe in the construction of tur@@ bin@@ es , from which it draws 30 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to inter@@ mitt@@ ent wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and 50 % higher than the European average .
On the other hand , thanks to the con@@ stan@@ cy of energy policy , our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than French households .
Since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory , French companies benefit from the che@@ apest electricity in Europe .
Due to this , any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render ill@@ us@@ ory the fine declarations on re-@@ industri@@ alisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .
A price , which a large majority of the French refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .
It should be rec@@ alled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 4@@ 10 000 resulting ones .
St@@ ron@@ g@@ ly export@@ -@@ oriented , it attrac@@ ts a galax@@ y of specialised R@@ ME &apos;s in international markets and creates many jobs , which cannot be moved elsewhere .
If France decided to abandon nuclear power , she would sacrifice a large number of these R@@ ME &apos;s and lose the annual 6 thousand million Euro &apos;s worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services .
What electri@@ cian would recommend a EP@@ R designed to function for six@@ ty years , if the decline of its manufacture was programm@@ ed ?
To solve the energy equ@@ ation , it must be admitted that there is no mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous or di@@ abo@@ lical source of production of electricity .
The development by Are@@ va of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy .
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety , is absolutely vital .
In France , we have a safety authority , which exercises an in@@ transi@@ gent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Fl@@ aman@@ ville .
Our teams , whose professionalism is recognised , are accu@@ stom@@ ed to the same saf@@ et@@ y-@@ related ob@@ session .
In a space of 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .
Only one , Three Mi@@ le Island , occurred under normal operating conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .
At T@@ cher@@ nobyl , the design of the re@@ actor and unfor@@ gi@@ vable human error brought about the drama .
At Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magn@@ it@@ ude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people .
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as it has from its two predec@@ essors .
The fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and French and German construc@@ tors , the EP@@ R presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .
Since it is being considered by all electri@@ cians wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at Fl@@ aman@@ ville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Are@@ va and ED@@ F by cle@@ aring their way to sei@@ zing the leadership of the un@@ avo@@ idable development of nuclear energy .
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emo@@ tion , do@@ g@@ mas and parti@@ san manoeu@@ v@@ res to domin@@ ate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy ?
Im@@ migration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a con@@ ges@@ tion of police , legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self-@@ proc@@ laimed status of the country as the country of French human rights .
More recently , it is administrative har@@ ass@@ ment of foreign students , which is topical , with the minister of the interior ( &quot; Lib@@ ér@@ ation &quot; on 23 May ) declar@@ ing that France &quot; does not need foreign talent , bri@@ ck@@ layers and wa@@ it@@ ers . &quot;
But it is only rarely analy@@ sed from the economic view@@ point .
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject .
On the Right , the tone was set by Jacques Chirac , who declared in 1976 that &quot; 9@@ 00@@ ,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers , &quot; and on the Left by Michel Roc@@ ard expl@@ aining in 1990 that France &quot; cannot accommodate all the world &apos;s mis@@ ery . &quot;
The only difference , the degree of gener@@ o@@ sity
In 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hor@@ des of Polish pl@@ um@@ bers was felt both on the Left and on the Right .
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society .
The only difference resi@@ des in the degree of gener@@ o@@ sity , which one d@@ eign@@ s to grant to immigrants .
In his programme , Franç@@ ois Holl@@ ande con@@ fines himself to ban@@ alities , saying that co-@@ development would allow our immigration problem to be solved . &quot;
This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .
As the economists I@@ an Gol@@ din and Ge@@ off@@ rey Cam@@ eron , remind us in a recent book summ@@ arising the most recent knowledge of immigration ( Exc@@ ep@@ tional People : How Migration Sha@@ ped Our World and Will De@@ fine Our Future , ma@@ i 2011 , Princ@@ et@@ on University Press , 3@@ 52 pp . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .
Rest@@ ra@@ ining immigration leads to an@@ a@@ em@@ ic growth and har@@ ms employment .
F@@ ears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers , in particular uns@@ killed ones , exer@@ ting down@@ ward pressure on wages .
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to , rather than replac@@ ements of , local labour , exerc@@ ising tra@@ des in which there is a shortage of local labour .
Un@@ skilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a sur@@ ge@@ on would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ sts , the compl@@ ement@@ arities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals .
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1 % in the mi@@ grat@@ ory flow causes an increase of between 0,@@ 6 and 0,@@ 9 % in real long-term pay .
And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a large proportion of natur@@ alised immigrants are among American Nobel pri@@ ze@@ winners , whilst Google , Intel , Pay@@ pal , eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants ) .
Migr@@ ants are also net contribut@@ ors to social systems , aver@@ aging 1 % of the total budgets of European countries .
Th World Labour Organisation estimates that for example in Germany , an im@@ migrant arriving at the age of 30 , will make a net contribution ( recei@@ pts less expenditure ) of an average of 150@@ ,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime .
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth &quot; with the teeth . &quot;
The teeth in question , intended to serve to dis@@ su@@ ade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .
Europe invented democracy , thinks in terms of European democracy
Democracy is a precious possession ; it is also a fragile one .
The European continent should be able to remember that having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the XX@@ th century the trage@@ dies of the World War , of totalit@@ ar@@ isms , the Holoc@@ aust , the gul@@ ag , but also Fran@@ co in Spain , Sal@@ az@@ ar in Portugal and the colon@@ els in Greece .
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally tri@@ umph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .
It is known that since the time of Napol@@ eon it was a matter of fac@@ ul@@ ty of thinking .
Universal suff@@ rage , in order to be the s@@ ine qu@@ a non of democracy , is not enough and can actually become a &quot; tool of op@@ pression &quot; as once said the re@@ public@@ an philos@@ op@@ her E@@ ti@@ enne V@@ ach@@ er@@ ot .
No , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the Lum@@ ier@@ es , economic and social solidarity , justice .
The European crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
In this respect , the pal@@ in@@ ode of a tru@@ e-@@ false Greek referendum will have a double re@@ vel@@ atory value , that of a need of a powerful re@@ versal of policy , but also that of the worrying sen@@ timent of its im@@ possibility and of its in@@ con@@ gru@@ ity .
This ambi@@ val@@ ence must be thought through , in order that it can be b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed .
The truth is that the lines of the for@@ efront of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the re@@ public@@ an soldiers are no longer fir@@ ing in the right direction .
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succ@@ ession of national refer@@ endums organised as required and in a confused sequence .
The &quot; free hand &quot; of an absolute European mon@@ arch , or a jump with tied feet into the nation@@ alist void ; what a choice for a citizen !
No , we do not want the bla@@ des of a gu@@ ill@@ ot@@ ine , but an exercise , joint , ser@@ ene and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on European level .
There are no crises in Greece , Italy , Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop en@@ um@@ er@@ ating them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe .
It is the whole of Europe , which def@@ ers to the dict@@ ates of the markets and of rating agencies , who suffer from their incap@@ acity and a lack of solidarity .
It is all Europe , which is hum@@ ili@@ ated on the international scene .
There is dis@@ quiet about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but it is the entire Europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and with its each of its nations .
The urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty , the direction of the European project .
Because it is by all working together , that Europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts , to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it .
Emer@@ ging from the crisis will ent@@ ail decisions on European level , which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster .
After having long fought this proposal by specialists and of Jacques Del@@ ors , the whole world now calls for a European economic government .
Let is be so .
But the idea without stronger economic , political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens , would be a fresh fol@@ ly and a new imp@@ asse .
We must launch a new stage of European construction .
To establish the Republic in France , it was necessary to &quot; make &quot; re@@ public@@ ans .
The Revolution of interests would not be enough .
This lesson remains valid .
We must construct a Europe integrated on economic level .
This can only be done by construc@@ ting a more democratic Europe on political level , a real popular European sovereignty .
To make Europe , let us make Europeans .
Chi@@ p maps without contacts become gener@@ alised
The worldwide chip map room opens on Tuesday at Vil@@ le@@ pin@@ te near Paris , in an optimistic atmosphere .
The year 2011 should actually end on an 11 % rise of worldwide sales of micro@@ process@@ ors ( Bank cards , teleph@@ ones with a SI@@ M card ... ) , with over 6 thousand million units , according to Euro@@ smart .
The most important sector is that of cont@@ ac@@ tless technology , which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a reader .
This year , 4@@ 60 million of cont@@ ac@@ tless chip cards should be sold worldwide , as against 3@@ 20 millions a year earlier !
Their share will progress in 2012 ( 5@@ 80 million units expected ) and represent almost 10 % of the global market of chip cards ( 6,@@ 9@@ 25 million cards ) .
For a long time , lag@@ ging behind the Asi@@ a-@@ Pacific region , Europe is now gaining ground in cont@@ ac@@ tless payment .
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 000 payment terminals accept them .
In France , the start is more modest ; 400@@ .000 cont@@ ac@@ tless Visa card are in use .
But the large stores are installing super@@ fast sl@@ ots .
This year , Car@@ ref@@ our issued 2,5 million cont@@ ac@@ tless Master@@ Cards .
To achieve higher speeds , it is now necessary to equi@@ p their clients .
&quot; Two large French establishments have undertaken to distribute systematically in future to their clients , bank cards equipped for cont@@ ac@@ tless use , announ@@ ces G@@ ér@@ ard N@@ é@@ bou@@ y , Director@@ -@@ General of Visa Europe France .
B@@ anks are testing payment by mobile telephone
But this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment , namely , the mobile telephone .
Fe@@ w appar@@ atus are at present equipped with N@@ FC technology ( Near F@@ ield Communication , essential for implementing these transactions .
&quot; They have been delayed .
&quot; But they should really take wing next year . &quot;
&quot; We are counting on a worldwide sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , explains Marc Ber@@ tin , president of Euro@@ smart .
But the banks are for@@ ging ahead .
Yesterday , C@@ ré@@ dit Agri@@ col@@ e announced a test to run from next December to June in Ca@@ en .
The i@@ Ph@@ ones of some 200 clients and collabor@@ ators are going to be equipped to author@@ ise cont@@ ac@@ tless payment .
The B@@ PC@@ E has a similar project in Strasbourg and in Mar@@ sei@@ lle .
And the Soci@@ été G@@ én@@ é@@ rale also said yesterday that it is preparing the market launch of an offer enabling its clients to pay via their mobil@@ es .
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is dis@@ qui@@ eted by links between the Islamic Ma@@ gh@@ re@@ b and the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am s@@ ect .
Sus@@ p@@ ected for a long time , the links between the terrorist group al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da in the Islamic Ma@@ gh@@ re@@ b ( A@@ q@@ mi ) and the Nig@@ eri@@ an B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am s@@ ect have been confirmed .
On Sunday , the Algeri@@ an dep@@ uty foreign minister , Ab@@ del@@ k@@ ader Mess@@ ah@@ el , even stated that Al@@ gi@@ ers is now certain .
&quot; The manner in which the two organisations operate and the reports of secret services show that there is a lot of cooperation , he explained without elabor@@ ating .
Paris appears to make a similar analysis .
The inquiry into the kid@@ n@@ apping of two Fren@@ ch@@ men in N@@ iger in January discovered two bridges .
The men kid@@ n@@ apped men in a restaurant in Ni@@ am@@ ey by relatives of Aqu@@ i , An@@ to@@ ine de L@@ é@@ o@@ co@@ ur and Vinc@@ ent Del@@ ory had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kid@@ n@@ app@@ ers during an operation launched by special French forces .
Among the rub@@ ble left behind by the action , French and Nig@@ eri@@ an investig@@ ators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
Terror@@ ist axis
The analysis of calls ex@@ changed indicates several inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors based in Mal@@ i , in N@@ iger and in Nigeria .
According to Radio France Internationale ( R@@ FI ) , two numbers interest the investig@@ ators in particular ; one leads to a Nig@@ eri@@ an who lived for a long time in Ma@@ i@@ du@@ gur@@ i , a town in Northern Nigeria , the cra@@ dle of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am and the other to a man said to be close to A@@ q@@ mi and to the s@@ ect .
&quot; This is an advance , but it is undoubtedly necessary to await more exact pro@@ ofs before talking about operational cooperation between A@@ q@@ mi and B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am . &quot;
&quot; But it is possible . &quot;
&quot; It has been known for years that the s@@ ect benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active , says Kun@@ le A@@ mu@@ wo , a Nig@@ eri@@ an resear@@ cher .
In recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am and from its methods of operation , which increasingly include resort to kam@@ ik@@ az@@ es and to increasingly complex explo@@ sive engines of the same type as those used by A@@ q@@ mi .
The international community , starting with Washington , is now exer@@ ting pressure on A@@ bu@@ ja to take into account the problems caused by B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am .
Nig@@ eri@@ an authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of en@@ ligh@@ tened persons not worthy of interest .

In this poor region , the association is enjoying rapid success .
It is poli@@ tic@@ ised and demands rigid respect of sh@@ aria , whilst its milit@@ ants engage in a struggle with the imp@@ ious central government .
The latter target primarily churches , bars and administrations .
In 2009 , the milit@@ ants of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am showed themselves particularly active , multi@@ pl@@ ying attacks on police establishments .
The reaction of A@@ bu@@ ja is , as usual , without light and sha@@ de .
The army surround@@ s a town and leaves 800 dead behind .
Moh@@ amm@@ ed Y@@ us@@ u@@ f , arrested alive , was killed in prison .
Now the s@@ ect will become radic@@ alised and will leave its northern fi@@ efs .
Last Christmas it claimed an attack , which left 80 dead at J@@ os and then more at A@@ bu@@ ja .
In June at A@@ bu@@ ja , B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am takes a secured police Q@@ G during a suicide attack , its first .
In August , the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target .
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa , which will move from Maur@@ it@@ ania to Somalia via Nigeria , now dis@@ qui@@ ets all security specialists .
Now that A@@ q@@ mi has invested Mal@@ i and N@@ iger and the Som@@ alis of al-@@ Ch@@ eb@@ ab operate in Kenya , B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am appears to be a new men@@ ace in the continent .
Last week during an interview in Nigeria with president Goo@@ d@@ luck Jon@@ athan , Ala@@ in Ju@@ pp@@ é warned against B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am and declared himself ready to share all intelligence .
The world according to the re@@ public@@ an presidential candidates
Conc@@ erning China , Iran , aid to Israel , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , Herman C@@ ain , and R@@ ick Per@@ ry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
Can an America weak@@ ened by crisis , lead a complex world by simple and indeed , simpli@@ stic , ideas ?
To listen to re@@ public@@ an presidential candidates , the elec@@ tors might believe it .
For some days , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , Herman C@@ ain , R@@ ick Per@@ ry and the others multip@@ ly res@@ o@@ und@@ ing and ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ated foreign policy declarations , which are traditionally a re@@ public@@ an strong suit .
Conc@@ erning China , Iran and aid to Israel , the slo@@ gan@@ s , are often f@@ used together .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , the best placed for nom@@ ination of the &quot; Grand Old Party , &quot; threatened to drag the Chinese before the OM@@ C and to acc@@ use them of &quot; manipulation of their currency , a sensitive subject in an America ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia .
So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war , he said .
J@@ on H@@ un@@ ts@@ man , Obama &apos;s former amb@@ ass@@ ador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to sup@@ press an attitude which flat@@ ters the emotions .
He called for a mus@@ cular , but a constructive , dialogue with Peking ( the current position of Obama ) .
But H@@ un@@ ts@@ man , who is stag@@ n@@ ating at the bottom of the poll@@ s , remains in@@ audi@@ ble .
In the style of Re@@ ag@@ an
Rom@@ ney also promised military strikes on Iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
&quot; If I am elected , I will stop Iran , he tru@@ mp@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; If Obama is re-@@ elected , they will have the bomb . &quot;
H@@ r also promised to increase military aid to Israel , acc@@ using Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner .
The entreprene@@ ur Herman C@@ ain , the second best-@@ placed candidate , declar@@ es an embar@@ rass@@ ing lack of knowledge of the files .
Recently , he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat , because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently un@@ aware of the fact that China has poss@@ essed it since 1964 !
The Texas govern@@ or R@@ ick Per@@ ry , who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran , says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against the drug car@@ tels .
Resort to the torture of terrorist susp@@ ects prohibited by Obama in 2009 , is also recommended by C@@ ain , Per@@ ry and by the candidate Mich@@ ele B@@ ach@@ mann .
One is far away from the 2008 re@@ public@@ an candidate John Mc@@ C@@ ain , a foreign policy heav@@ y@@ weight .
The opponents of the current president reply that Re@@ ag@@ an also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war .
They recall that Obama himself was an am@@ ateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti-@@ terrorism .
They insist with good reason on the set@@ back of his na@@ ive dialogue with Iran on the pre@@ mature departure of the &quot; boys &quot; from Iraq , his ter@@ gi@@ vers@@ ations in Libya labelling him weak .
But the attack is not so easy .
The population judges as positive Obama &apos;s the balance of national security , which eliminated B@@ in Laden .
Since Iraq , it di@@ stru@@ sts military interventions , which run into qu@@ icks@@ ands .
And in argu@@ ing that it is necessary to re@@ construct America economically to revi@@ ve its leadership , Obama is right .
The North Stream , a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
The North Stream gas@@ duc@@ t connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea , has been commissioned .
It is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m , the giant Russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a &quot; b@@ ang . &quot;
Over 500 guests including four heads of State and of government took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic , between an or@@ chest@@ ral performance and a fine buffet , in the inau@@ gur@@ ation of North Stream , the new gas@@ duc@@ t , which directly links Russia and Germany under the sea .
Sy@@ mbo@@ lic@@ ally , the German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the Russian president D@@ mit@@ ri Med@@ ve@@ dev , the French prime minister Franç@@ ois F@@ ill@@ on and his Dutch opposite number Mark R@@ ut@@ te jointly turned the val@@ ve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network .
With this new gas@@ duc@@ t , 27@@ ,5 thousand million additional c@@ ub@@ ic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 2@@ 24 km linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mec@@ kl@@ em@@ burg-@@ Pom@@ er@@ ania .
A second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million c@@ ub@@ ic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire French consumption .
And the possibility of construc@@ ting a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
For Gaz@@ pro@@ m , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .
The project was f@@ ier@@ c@@ ely compet@@ ed for by Poland and the Baltic States .
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( Poland or the Ukraine ) .
These two countries will lose some of their power : it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets .
At the most critical point of the debate , Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new &quot; German-@@ Soviet pact , &quot; referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occup@@ y Poland in 1939 .
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive .
By supporting this Russian project , Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .
But at the price of depri@@ ving Europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe .
Russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries , which consu@@ me large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are dec@@ lining .
&quot; This gas@@ duc@@ t is a component of partnership with Russia , it is a new ar@@ tery which links us organ@@ ically , &quot; confirmed Franç@@ ois F@@ ill@@ on inau@@ gur@@ ating the gas@@ duc@@ t , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
All this explains the broad sm@@ iles on the faces of the heads of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , present in large numbers at L@@ ub@@ min , the point of arrival of the gas .
The construction of this gas@@ duc@@ t is also a technical exploit .
The under@@ sea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships &apos; anch@@ ors .
I@@ r res@@ ts on the bottom of the sea , at an average depth of 200 metres .
To construct it , it was necessary to avoid min@@ e@@ fields dating back to the second World War .
&quot; A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precau@@ tion , &quot; says J@@ ens Müller , spo@@ kes@@ man of North Stream company .
It was also necessary to multip@@ ly steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .
The pipeline is a long metal ser@@ p@@ ent , of weight equivalent to that of 24@@ 2 Eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no val@@ ves and no maintenance stations .
A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the Swe@@ des were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores .
&quot; In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , &quot; states J@@ ens Müller .
In the case of a le@@ ak , the gas contained in the gas@@ duc@@ t therefore escap@@ es into the air .
But this is thought to be unlikely by the construc@@ tors who provided wel@@ ds to le@@ ak only every 100 000 years .
The surveillance of the state of the gas@@ duc@@ t is provided by an under@@ sea ro@@ bot , pul@@ led by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an appar@@ atus circul@@ ating within the gas@@ duc@@ t .
Being cigar@@ -@@ shaped , it is introduced inside the 1-@@ met@@ re wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
On arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal de@@ formation .
The gas@@ duc@@ t was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .
This is 200 bar on leaving and 100 bar on arrival .
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project .
The leader remains Gaz@@ pro@@ m , which holds 51 % of the shar@@ ehol@@ ding .
The others are the German companies E.ON and BAS@@ F ( 15.@@ 5 % each ) and the Dutch Gas@@ un@@ ie and the French Group G@@ DF Su@@ ez ( 9 % each ) .
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream , deleg@@ ated to construct and to operate the gas@@ duc@@ t .
It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m next le@@ ased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .
&quot; Gaz@@ pro@@ m will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , &quot; states J@@ ens Müller .
The financing of the construction of the gas@@ duc@@ t was provided to the extent of 30 % by the shareholders and of 70 % by Bank loans .
The total cost of the works will be 7.@@ 4 thousand million Euros for the two pi@@ pel@@ ines .
The G@@ DF Su@@ ez investment will be about 240 millions .
But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since Gaz@@ pro@@ m assumes the entire risk .
The gas@@ duc@@ t emerg@@ es from the Baltic sea at L@@ ub@@ min on a sandy litt@@ oral plan@@ ted with con@@ i@@ fers .
4.@@ 5 met@@ re high val@@ ves form the gas exit .
Sens@@ ors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gra@@ vi@@ ties of arriving gas before being transferred into German gas@@ duc@@ ts .
Since last Tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million c@@ ub@@ ic metres of Russian gas every hour .
At full capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .
Mol@@ esk@@ ine , a brand card .
Cre@@ ated fifteen years ago by an Italian company , Mol@@ esk@@ ine will restore the taste of writing .
It is a sc@@ ent of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the light of a cand@@ le .
The Mol@@ esk@@ ine not@@ ebook is easily recognised , by its black rec@@ t@@ ang@@ ular cover , its el@@ astic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .
Nevertheless , the Mol@@ esk@@ ine not@@ ebook as we know it today , was born in 1997 .
The Italian company Mo@@ do Mo@@ do , based in Milan , decided to launch a designer not@@ ebook .
Maria Seb@@ reg@@ on@@ di , then a consult@@ ant of the company , has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product .
The not@@ ebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique , the m@@ ole skin which means var@@ nis@@ hed cotton used for covering ben@@ ches , for example .
This type of not@@ ebook is said to be highly pri@@ zed by writers and travellers .
&quot; Mol@@ esk@@ ine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object , which was an av@@ ant@@ garde artists &apos; icon up to the XX@@ th century , &quot; related Maria Seb@@ reg@@ on@@ di , who has since become the manager of the brand name at Mo@@ do Mo@@ do .
Su@@ cc@@ ess is there .
Between 2006 and 2010 , sales rose by 25 % to reach 12.@@ 7 million units .
One has trav@@ elled far from the production of the first years , when only 3000 not@@ eb@@ ooks were made .
Mol@@ esk@@ ine is crossing the Italian fron@@ tiers and is export@@ ing to 70 countries , from France to the USA .
It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser , because the not@@ ebook attrac@@ ts equally a business@@ man , a student and a professional .
Mol@@ esk@@ ine consumers are co@@ smopoli@@ tan , open-@@ minded and cultiv@@ ated .
The small Italian company , which had only 12 employees at the start , now has almost 100 and two offices , one in Milan and the other in New York .
Its distri@@ butes its not@@ eb@@ ooks to F@@ n@@ ac libraries , small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known .
&quot; We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , not@@ with@@ standing the rise of e-mail , &quot; explains Maria Seb@@ reg@@ on@@ di .
This cultural signature ac@@ companies the development of Mol@@ esk@@ ine ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition &quot; Det@@ our &quot; where architects or artists exhi@@ bit their own not@@ ebook .
In August , it also launched a le@@ op@@ ard@@ skin pattern cover on the occasion of the Film Festival in Loc@@ ar@@ no .
Explo@@ iting its success and the cultural a@@ ura , Mol@@ esk@@ ine diversi@@ fied its products to include hand@@ bags , p@@ ens , computer bags . The brand includes every kind of support .
A success , which ar@@ ous@@ ed en@@ vy ; in the autumn of 2006 , Mo@@ do Mo@@ do was bought by the investment fund S@@ G Capital Europe , now Syn@@ t@@ egr@@ a Capital , to write a new page in the history of Mol@@ esk@@ ine .
Why is the rate of unemployment of handic@@ apped workers so high ?
Some 19 % of handic@@ apped persons are looking for work .
The 15th week for the employment of the handic@@ apped starts today .
Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005 , the rate of unemployment of the handic@@ apped is still twice as high as the average , namely 19 % , ver@@ sus 9 % for the population as a whole .
Dis@@ cour@@ aging ?
&quot; No , stresses Eric Blan@@ ch@@ et , Director@@ -@@ General of Adap@@ t , the association which organis@@ es the week for the employment of the handic@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable . &quot;
&quot; At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2@@ x but 3@@ x as high . &quot;
&quot; There is however still a huge amount to do . &quot;
It must be said that for the handic@@ apped , the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many .
They are rather old : 37 % are over 50 ( 17 % on average ) .
They have rather a low level of qualifications ; 80 % do not have the &quot; b@@ ac &quot; and out of the 2.@@ 3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handic@@ apped .
Lastly , long-term unemployment is very widespread , being 85 % for the handic@@ apped ver@@ sus 38 % on an average .
Brief@@ ly , all these are criteria which greatly complic@@ ate a return to employment and which constitute the n@@ ub of the problem , &quot; according to Christian G@@ rap@@ in , direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of Tre@@ mp@@ lin , an association created in 1992 to help companies to recru@@ it handic@@ apped workers .
Here are some of the bra@@ kes .
It is hardly necessary to speak about ment@@ alities , which do change , but too slowly .
A study carried out in April by the association IM@@ S-@@ Ent@@ rep@@ r@@ end@@ re pour la Cit@@ é showed that the managers ques@@ tioned had a low level of knowledge of h@@ andi@@ cap , &quot; with an &quot; over-@@ representation of persons in whe@@ el@@ chairs , psych@@ ically or intellec@@ tually defic@@ ient persons . &quot;
Res@@ ult - private companies emplo@@ ying over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of emplo@@ ying the 6 % of handic@@ apped workers , fixed by a law dating back to 1987 .
The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.@@ 6 % .
&quot; We are now on around 3 % , &quot; says Pierre Blan@@ c , direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of the A@@ ge@@ fi@@ ph , the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law .
Pro@@ of : The number of &quot; tax@@ ed &quot; establishments , like the sums paid , have fallen between 2007 and 2011 , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and from 6@@ 06 to 4@@ 80 million Euros ) .
&quot; The law of 2005 , which raised the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains Pierre Blan@@ c . &quot;
&quot; But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness , in particular within large groups . &quot;
According to the mini@@ stry of employment , only 59 % of establishments emplo@@ ying between 20 and 49 handic@@ apped persons , ver@@ sus 82 % of companies emplo@@ ying between 100 and 19@@ 9 persons .
Chance : &quot; What happiness &quot;
Before facing the Blu@@ es on Tuesday evening ( 20.@@ 45 hr@@ s ) Eden H@@ az@@ ard and Geor@@ ges Le@@ ek@@ ens did not hide the pleasure , which this friendly match gave to them .
We do not go so far as to say that there was con@@ ni@@ v@@ ance between them , but the image is symbolic .
S@@ itting side by side on the tri@@ b@@ une of the audi@@ t@@ orium of the Sta@@ de de France , Geor@@ ges Le@@ ek@@ ens and Eden H@@ az@@ ard made peace .
Five months following the gest@@ ure of hum@@ our of his attack@@ er against Turkey , the Belgian sel@@ ector can only be pra@@ ised .
&quot; I am very pleased with Eden , his progress and the fact that he is Belgian . &quot;
&quot; I want to go forward , ass@@ ures the L@@ il@@ lo@@ is .
In contrast between his respective club and selection performances , &quot; it is of a piece if it is justified . &quot;
&quot; At L@@ ille , I am there all the year round , which is not the case of Belgium . &quot;
&quot; I must take my marks . &quot;
Sel@@ ected to play against Romania on Friday evening in its match against France , H@@ az@@ ard went to Saint-@@ Den@@ is in order at last to &quot; shine . &quot;
Not however for@@ getting the notion of &quot; pleas@@ ing . &quot;
He encouraged the Blu@@ es from the age of 7 years and the vic@@ t@@ orious campaigns of 1998 and 2000 .
&quot; I always supported them , he affir@@ ms .
This necessarily particip@@ ates in strengthening even more the particular character of this match .
All the more so , since opposite are Ma@@ thi@@ eu ( Deb@@ u@@ chy ) , Y@@ oh@@ an ( Cab@@ ay@@ e ) and A@@ di@@ l ( Ram@@ i ) , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
&quot; We just cross@@ ed each others path . &quot;
&quot; To be able to play against them , that is pure happiness ! &quot;
With bon@@ hom@@ ie , Le@@ ek@@ ens rec@@ alled &quot; pride . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ de &quot; of playing in &quot; a g@@ ala match . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ de &quot; also in in@@ ding ass &quot; neigh@@ bour &quot; that France has &quot; become again a very high level team &quot; only a little more than one year after the trau@@ ma of Kn@@ ys@@ na .
&quot; Laur@@ ent Blan@@ c was a th@@ under@@ bol@@ t , he enth@@ uses .
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro , the techni@@ cian will share an aircraft with the Blu@@ es management ... Brazil in 2014 .
&quot; Our little Belgi@@ ans become big , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; One is building something , the players are ambitious , they are hung@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; You will realise this during the matches to come . Inclu@@ ding that against France .
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Ben@@ to starts its return match against Bosnia ( 22@@ h@@ 00 ) very optim@@ is@@ tically , this Tuesday in Lisbon .
On their way there , both teams appeared to lack realis@@ m .
&quot; At the end of these 90 minutes , we will be a happy team and most importantly , a happy country . &quot;
Paulo Ben@@ to already sees himself in Poland and in the Ukraine .
For him there is not a shadow of a doubt , the Sel@@ ection , with which he has been at odds since September 2010 , will qualify for Euro 2012 .
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness .
But there is match to play and an oppon@@ ent , Bosnia to con@@ quer .
In view of the ( 0-@@ 0 ) , on Friday in the hell of Z@@ en@@ ica it is clear that the games are not over .
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour , it was not able to reach this precious target , which would have con@@ sol@@ ed it .
&quot; It is a good result , which nevertheless involves a certain risk &quot;
But on their side , in their illumin@@ ated Sta@@ de de la Lu@@ z in Lisbon , the Portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , &quot; said an optimistic , but lu@@ ci@@ d , Ben@@ to
&quot; We are expecting a very close match , but we are convinced that we can win , declared the Portuguese tra@@ iner aged 42 .
&quot; We continue to have a 50 % chance of being at Euro 2012 , &quot; even under the successor of Carlos Qu@@ ei@@ ro@@ z .
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia obli@@ ges the Portuguese to win .
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosni@@ ans .
&quot; It is a good result , which nevertheless carries some risk , reg@@ rets Ben@@ to .
&quot; We are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players poss@@ essing many individual qualities , &quot; he added .
As already in Z@@ en@@ ica , the Portuguese would plan to exert maximal pressure on the Bosni@@ ans from the start , to &quot; give them no time to think . &quot;
A good idea , provided that it will , prove realistic this time .
