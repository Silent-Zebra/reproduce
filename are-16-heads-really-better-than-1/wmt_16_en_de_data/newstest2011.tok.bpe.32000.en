What will they do ? C@@ SS@@ D lacks knowledge of both Vol@@ dem@@ ort and cand@@ y bars in Prague
New Coun@@ c@@ il@@ ors of C@@ SS@@ D will most probably have to overcome certain language barriers to understand their ol@@ d-@@ new colleagues from O@@ DS in Prague Council and municipal council .
Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz &quot; tested &quot; the Social Democ@@ rat members of the new Council in terms of the well-@@ established s@@ lang that origin@@ ated in the town hall during the few last years , when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners .
Co@@ ded voc@@ abul@@ ary that was established by Prague political elite during the previous era of the may@@ or P@@ av@@ el B@@ em , describes some of the most famous persons , situations and affairs in the city .
Sur@@ pris@@ ingly , it turned out that the new council members do not understand the well-known concepts .
At least they say so .
&quot; Who is Vol@@ dem@@ ort ? &quot;
&quot; I really do not know . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m rather a no@@ vice in Prague politics , &quot; responded Lu@@ kas Kau@@ cky , the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or for culture , to the test of &quot; Go@@ d@@ father &quot; voc@@ abul@@ ary .
And even though he is a political veter@@ an , the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Karel Bre@@ z@@ ina responded simil@@ arly .
For instance regarding the term &quot; golf hole . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the only one of the presented words that I use at least occasionally . &quot;
&quot; Otherwise , I generally do not recognize the s@@ lang . &quot;
Out of the g@@ loss@@ ary , published by Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz last June just before the El@@ ection Congress of O@@ DS , edi@@ tors selected six examples , mainly well-known in connection with the Prague City Hall .
The Socialists were to explain the concepts of &quot; Vol@@ dem@@ ort , &quot; the &quot; greatest golf hole in Prague , &quot; &quot; go to a cand@@ y bar , &quot; &quot; bul@@ l neck , &quot; &quot; betra@@ yal of the capital &quot; and &quot; to plate with metal . &quot;
Three Coun@@ c@@ il@@ ors agreed with the qui@@ z , the fourth - Ant@@ on@@ ín Wein@@ ert , who is to head the education in Prague in the future - promised to attend an interview first , but later he stopped answer@@ ing the phone .
The fifth Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or , Peter Dol@@ í@@ ne@@ k , refused the test straight away .
&quot; I do not pay attention to such things at all and I am not going to evaluate the way the Civi@@ c Democrats talk . &quot;
&quot; I am rather concerned how we will match our programs , &quot; he said .
As we already mentioned , Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Lu@@ kas Kau@@ cky would report@@ edly not recognize in the above heading that it is about an influential entreprene@@ ur and friend of ex-@@ Mayor B@@ em , Roman Jan@@ ou@@ se@@ k .
&quot; Vol@@ dem@@ ort &quot; bears no meaning to Kau@@ cky and the only term he correctly gu@@ essed in the test is &quot; the greatest golf hole in Prague . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s Blan@@ ka tunnel , &quot; says Kau@@ cky , and immediately adds : &quot; But I know it from the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll have to get myself a language course , &quot; he qui@@ ps .
Golf hole as the Blan@@ ka tunnel was then correctly de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed by not only the mat@@ ador Karel Bre@@ z@@ ina , but also the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or for the environment , Lu@@ kas Pla@@ chy .
Both Social Democrats then also know who is actually Vol@@ dem@@ ort and Lu@@ kas Pla@@ chy is familiar with this character - he also gu@@ esses the right meaning of the phrase &quot; to go to a cand@@ y bar . &quot;
&quot; That means going to a company in Prague &quot; he sa@@ ils close to the meaning , which is the office of Jan@@ ou@@ se@@ k &apos;s companies .
Similarly to Bre@@ z@@ ina he notes that he gained the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a voc@@ abul@@ ary himself .
According to the test@@ ees , there is no such gro@@ ov@@ y g@@ loss@@ ary of s@@ lang terms in Social Democrats Party .
&quot; I even consulted my colleagues , but it seems that we really do not have anything like that . &quot;
&quot; We rather address one another with names , sometimes we use ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations and name gar@@ bles , &quot; said Prague C@@ SS@@ D chairman Peter H@@ ul@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý , addressed by party members as H@@ ul@@ da .
&quot; At school I was called Bir@@ ch , but I do not know if my colleagues call me so , &quot; he ad@@ mits his own nick@@ name , Karel Bre@@ z@@ ina .
Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz tested the nick@@ name and it works .
Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Wein@@ ert is Gr@@ and@@ pa or less friendly Old Man for party members , the Coun@@ c@@ il@@ or Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Po@@ che , who won attention just before the election by the fraud in party sponsor@@ ship , was nick@@ named &quot; I@@ gr@@ á@@ č@@ ek &quot; by some colleagues .
Nick@@ names are also the only thing accepted by the Social Democrats in the in@@ tra-@@ party speech .
H@@ ul@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý report@@ edly does not like to be addressed as H@@ ul@@ da , but Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz has also seen another nick@@ name of that Prague chairman .
&quot; Dr. of Black@@ -@@ jack Law &quot; supposedly rec@@ alls that Peter H@@ ul@@ í@@ n@@ sk@@ ý got his D@@ eg@@ ree of J@@ U@@ Dr at the Police Academy in B@@ rati@@ sla@@ va .
The government wants to limit the torture of &quot; wit@@ ches , &quot; a brochure was released
Women declared as wit@@ ches in Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o usually have several common characteristics .
They rather come from the older generation , cannot engage in work for health reasons for instance , are un@@ married and have no children .
The one who &quot; becomes &quot; a wit@@ ch is sent into isolation in order to not jeopardi@@ ze the rest of the village .
&quot; Such a fate be@@ falls men only very rarely . &quot;
&quot; Nor healthy young women are sent away because they help with work and bear children , &quot; says the nun , who takes care for more than a hundred women ban@@ ished from their community in a special care home in the capital of Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o , West Africa .
Local government now decided to combat the unusual &quot; social measures . &quot;
It has published an information book@@ let , which should help limit the wit@@ ch-@@ h@@ unt .
But there is a s@@ na@@ g in that .
&quot; More than 70 percent of adults in Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o cannot read , &quot; pointed out the disadvantage of written education Die Standard daily .
Acc@@ us@@ ations of wit@@ ch@@ craft are also common in other African countries .
In Gh@@ ana , which borders with Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o , a s@@ event@@ y-@@ two Am@@ ma Hem@@ ma@@ h died last week after three women and two men tor@@ tured her , d@@ ous@@ ed in ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e and set ali@@ ght .
The case was reported by BBC .
The perpet@@ r@@ ators claim that it was an unfortunate coinci@@ dence .
According to their version the oil that is used for rit@@ ual ano@@ in@@ ting ign@@ ited and bur@@ ned the woman to death .
It alle@@ ge@@ dly bur@@ st into fl@@ ames after the group wanted to &quot; exp@@ el the evil spirit &quot; from the woman .
Isol@@ ation of &quot; wit@@ ches &quot; is widely supported by people regardless of their education level .
Da@@ ily Der Standard quoted a business@@ man of fort@@ y-@@ two from Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o : &quot; Dev@@ our@@ ers of human sou@@ ls have always posed a danger , &quot; he said .
While in Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o the government is trying hard to moderate the wit@@ ch h@@ unt , the G@@ ambi@@ a &apos;s President himself participated in the h@@ unt last year .
&quot; G@@ ambi@@ an President J@@ á@@ m@@ í after the death of his a@@ unt un@@ le@@ ashed a large-scale wit@@ ch-@@ h@@ unt for wit@@ ches alle@@ ge@@ dly involved in her death and trying to use black magic to kill the president . &quot;
&quot; He invited sham@@ ans from nearby Guinea to help him and they accompanied by polic@@ emen , soldiers and president &apos;s private security gu@@ ards forced rand@@ om@@ ly selected men and women from G@@ ambi@@ an villages to the president &apos;s ran@@ ch in Kan@@ il@@ ai , &quot; said Am@@ nesty International in their report .
The arrested people had to drink a po@@ tion of her@@ bs with hall@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ genic effects , which also causes int@@ est@@ inal and kid@@ ney problems .
Two prisoners did not survive .
After international pressure nearly a thousand of in@@ m@@ ates were released .
Bak@@ ala &apos;s ten@@ ant : Heating in the sto@@ ve , signed the rent increase
An older heav@@ y@@ set man wal@@ ked out of the door of the client center of R@@ PG F@@ lat@@ s Company owned by the &apos; coal bar@@ on &apos; Z@@ den@@ ek Bak@@ ala , the largest priv@@ ately owned rental apartments &quot; owner in the Czech Republic .
Under his arm he carried a folder with new le@@ ase contracts to three flat@@ s : his , his daughter &apos;s and his son &apos;s , who is in prison .
All the three &apos;s rent has just risen due to dereg@@ ulation .
From next year will the son pay C@@ Z@@ K 4@@ 100 for the second class 2 + 1 apartment instead of the current C@@ Z@@ K 3@@ 500 per month .
&quot; And there is no hot water and we must heat in the &quot; Pet@@ ra sto@@ ve &quot; ( solid fuel sto@@ ve , ed@@ . note ) &quot; the man points his finger on his son &apos;s new contract , which he is authorized to signed by pro@@ xy .
&quot; But I signed it , &quot; he says half ang@@ ri@@ ly , half res@@ ig@@ ne@@ dly .
By@@ ty@@ O@@ K@@ D.@@ cz Civi@@ c Association , which identified the new ten@@ ancy conditions as &quot; unfair and im@@ moral , &quot; advis@@ es ten@@ ants not to sign the new contract and wait until 7 December , when they will publish a guidance on how to counter them .
But the man remains skep@@ tic .
&quot; One says this , another that , &quot; he fro@@ w@@ ns .
O@@ stra@@ va has become a great laboratory of dereg@@ ulation .
After the New Year the vast majority of d@@ well@@ ings with non-@@ market rent in the Czech Republic will be subject to dereg@@ ulation .
Aktu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz therefore decided to visit the &quot; laboratory &quot; itself .
Hav@@ í@@ ř@@ ov &apos;s waiting room of R@@ PG is one of the four in the O@@ stra@@ va region and is already full at nine a.m. on Tu@@ es@@ da .
Stand@@ ing right at the door , there is a security guard from a security agency with a call device nearby .
Special button &quot; R@@ ent 2011 &quot; sh@@ ines on the touch screen .
One t@@ ap and the machine issues a sli@@ p with a number .
You do not even manage to read &quot; 15@@ 7 &quot; and your figure be@@ eps on the large screen below the ceiling of the waiting room .
It is your turn in half a second .
An older couple comes to ask about the le@@ ase after a few moments , there is apparently no r@@ ush for new le@@ ases in the waiting room at all .
Most people came to solve the same problems as usual - request for rep@@ airs , ins@@ ured events etc .
Let@@ ters with new le@@ ases have been sent to mail@@ boxes of most of the ten@@ ants of 44 thousand d@@ well@@ ings R@@ PG portfolio in the O@@ stra@@ va region since about mid-@@ November .
R@@ PG By@@ ty proposes to increase rent by 15 to 38 percent in these letters .
A special desk for new le@@ ases was opened on 18 November in the client center .
&quot; It has been in operation for over a week , so it &apos;s only run@@ -in , &quot; respond the c@@ ler@@ ks at the desk after some hes@@ itation , when the client introduces himself as a journalist .
Dereg@@ ulation and Bak@@ ala &apos;s former mining flat@@ s are local hot topic .
Before the elections , it was quite lou@@ dly adopted by Parliament Vice-President and a native of O@@ stra@@ va L@@ ub@@ om@@ ir Z@@ a@@ or@@ al@@ ek of the Social Democrats , and even now it f@@ ills local newspapers .
&quot; I have been asking them for this new floor for twenty years . &quot;
&quot; They have not even changed a f .. king plate in the bathroom , &quot; rel@@ iev@@ es the man mentioned in the introduction .
It is mostly the reti@@ red who only come to see if they can I get a discount on rent if they sign on time , as R@@ PG their promises in their special offer .
Hal@@ f off the February rent will also receive the other ten@@ ants who will have signed the new contract by 15 December .
Hav@@ í@@ ř@@ ov &apos;s &quot; dereg@@ ul@@ atory &quot; desk is certainly not overwhel@@ med with questions .
&quot; Out of yesterday &apos;s 360 clients only about for@@ ty to fif@@ ty came to inqu@@ ire about le@@ ases in 2011 , &quot; estimates the c@@ ler@@ k behind the counter .
R@@ PG on their bul@@ le@@ tin boards and Web site proposed the negotiation of individual contracts where needed .
However , if the parties fail to agree on the le@@ ase , an independent tri@@ bunal will have to establish the rent .
&quot; This is not a threat , but the information on the only possible legitimate and completely legal procedure , &quot; says R@@ PG on its website .
&quot; Nob@@ ody will sue them here , &quot; said one of the R@@ PG F@@ lat@@ s c@@ ler@@ ks and the man on the street outside the client center partly agrees .
&quot; I have C@@ Z@@ K 13@@ ,000 pension and five thousands are left for the meals , I cannot afford bringing it to the court , &quot; he said .
The c@@ ler@@ k but then doubts after all .
&quot; We &apos;ll see . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Z@@ a@@ or@@ al@@ ek advis@@ es them in the media not to sign , so some people are waiting , &quot; she thinks .
The regulation of r@@ ents ends in the most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to R@@ PG By@@ ty is the increase of r@@ ents an economic necessity .
&quot; The current rent is still less than the amount needed for simple maintenance of housing stock , &quot; comm@@ ented P@@ av@@ el Klim@@ es , director of R@@ PG portfolio of residential apartments , and reminded that negl@@ ect of the housing stock compl@@ ained about in relation just to those an@@ gr@@ y ten@@ ants , is the main reason for the increase in r@@ ents according to the house owners .
While within the five years between 2005 and 2010 could R@@ PG invest four billion from the r@@ ents into the apartments , within the four years between 2011 and 2014 it should be 5.@@ 2 billion .
Large screen hang@@ ing from the ceiling opposite the p@@ added seats of Hav@@ í@@ ř@@ ov &apos;s waiting room keeps repe@@ ating some information highlighted in red .
&quot; The increase in r@@ ents in 2011 by 15 % and less concerns 3@@ 1,@@ 200 flat@@ s , it is more than 90 % of R@@ PG apartments . &quot;
&quot; And it will always be a maximum of C@@ Z@@ K 7.@@ 50 per square meter and month , &quot; appears on the screen .
Only for 400 apartments of R@@ PG portfolio the rent will rise by 38 percent .
&quot; In these cases there will be an increase from an extremely low amount of C@@ Z@@ K 19.@@ 66 per square meter , &quot; points R@@ PG .
In 26@@ 00 apartments will the rent remain the same next year .
R@@ PG By@@ ty promises that dereg@@ ulation of r@@ ents will not be sudden , it will be spread over four to eight years .
It adds another commitment : all the money from rent increases ( see the chart ) will be invested by the company back to the flat@@ s , especially in heat savings - new windows and ins@@ ulation .
Pri@@ ority will be given to people who sign the agreement to increase r@@ ents .
Off@@ ices need a k@@ inder@@ garten nearby , architects have understood
Av@@ ri@@ op@@ o@@ int Office Building in Br@@ no is the new headquarters of Arch@@ .@@ Design Company .
Nob@@ ody would expect that it contains a tiny k@@ inder@@ garten with everything necessary - with col@@ ored walls , imagin@@ ative furniture , a b@@ unch of toys and even a mini@@ ature golf course on the outdoor terrace .
Since October last year the children of Arch@@ .@@ Design employees can attend .
Archit@@ ec@@ tural design company , Arch@@ .@@ Design , whose studios produced a number of important buildings in Br@@ no , have included the space for their corporate tiny k@@ inder@@ garten even in the first drawings of the Av@@ ri@@ op@@ o@@ int building .
It indeed emplo@@ ys nearly 90 people - mainly bab@@ y-@@ bo@@ om@@ -@@ aged and they want their female designers and architects to quickly return to work .
Along with the possibility of part-@@ time contracts the k@@ inder@@ garten is a benefit that Arch@@ .@@ Design offers to their employees within their welfare program .
F@@ em@@ ale construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to combine their demanding jobs with child care .
Tin@@ z k@@ inder@@ garten has been invented by Ar@@ ch . Design employees themselves and with the support from management they were able to obtain a grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs .
Corporate tiny k@@ inder@@ garten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Oper@@ ational Program Human Resour@@ ces and Employment and state budget of C@@ Z .
Thanks to grant funding ( subsi@@ dy of 2.@@ 8 million ) they were able to purchase equipment and for the period of two years provide qualified personnel and operation .
After the dep@@ letion of financial aid ( 2 years ) the Arch@@ .@@ Design Company must operate the k@@ inder@@ garten for 3 years at its own expense .
Pre@@ par@@ ation of the project la@@ sted one year and the Economy R@@ ating Company helped with the applications for grant significantly .
The care is provided by qualified staff , children are taken care of by a nur@@ se and a k@@ inder@@ garten teacher all day ; the k@@ inder@@ garten can therefore be attended by children without any age restrictions , but most of them are over 3 years old .
As this is a &quot; Mini-@@ k@@ inder@@ garten , &quot; only 5 children may be present at the same time , even though more can attend in the course of the day altogether .
The operation of the k@@ inder@@ garten is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the nur@@ ser@@ y , regardless of the position in the company hierarch@@ y .
Although this is an individual education and care , the program content in the mini-@@ k@@ inder@@ garten is comparable with the framework program of pres@@ ch@@ ool education .
Children are not only playing here , they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school@@ ing and English is also taught here .
The class is not only equipped with toys , inspir@@ ing games , but also with a computer that children can use .
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment .
Par@@ ents can always check their child and it prevents stress situations related to delayed pick@@ -up from nur@@ series located far from their parents &quot; workplace .
Par@@ ents then use the working time much more efficiently .
Not surpris@@ ingly , a loy@@ al employee - employ@@ er relationship is produced there naturally .
Arch@@ .@@ Design became one of the Czech companies , which offer significant benefit when recru@@ iting new employees , they are friendly to the family and through this program they have enhanced personnel marketing .
House of b@@ ones fascin@@ ates even after 100 years . Look at the inter@@ iors by Gau@@ di
The roof looks like a pre@@ historic liz@@ ard &apos;s sp@@ ine , the sta@@ ir@@ case remin@@ ds of a din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur back@@ bone and balconies are open fish mou@@ ths .
This is the house of Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó in Barcelona by the Catal@@ an architect Ant@@ oni Gau@@ d@@ í .
The locals started to call it the House of b@@ ones for its organic shapes .
Organ@@ ic shapes , wild colors , unusual use of stone , frag@@ ments of tiles and mo@@ sa@@ ics , fac@@ ade remin@@ is@@ cent of sc@@ ales and soft cur@@ ves everywhere , all of which are typical of Art N@@ ou@@ veau by Ant@@ oni Gau@@ d@@ í .
The fac@@ ade of the house opens dre@@ am@@ y lines , soft colors and tex@@ tures remin@@ is@@ cent of nature and animals .
The detailed look reveals geom@@ etry , rhyth@@ m , and well-@@ considered order .
At night , the entire fac@@ ade of the house seems even more dram@@ ati@@ cal , it is lit so that the g@@ loss paint impression would be further enhanced .
Win@@ ding and twi@@ sting shapes appear equally as much in@@ doors .
W@@ ood follows in the window frames in the waves , along with hand@@ ra@@ ils , door tri@@ m , mol@@ dings and watch .
Bat@@ ll@@ ó House , located in the Ei@@ x@@ ample district on a busy shopping street Pass@@ ei@@ g de Gra@@ cia No. 43 , was re@@ built from the original house in 18@@ 77 by the architect Em@@ ili@@ o S@@ al Cor@@ tes .
Rec@@ on@@ struction took place for two years and the house was completed in 19@@ 06 .
The investor , a weal@@ thy industri@@ alist Jose@@ p Bat@@ ll@@ ó , initially insi@@ sted on the demo@@ li@@ tion of the old building and construction of an entirely new one , but soon he adopted Gau@@ di &apos;s idea of an unusual and cheaper re@@ development of the house .
Apartment building Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó was nevertheless not designed by Ant@@ oni Gau@@ d@@ í alone .
Archit@@ ect Jose@@ p Maria Ju@@ jo@@ l co@@ operated with him .
It was his developer &apos;s board where the decor@@ ations for the representative apartment of the property owner were created , as well as the use of a mo@@ sa@@ ic on the fac@@ ade .
A number of other authors and artists worked on the fac@@ ade .
Joint work on dra@@ fts for Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó building started a successful cooperation of Ju@@ jo@@ l and Gau@@ di .
Ju@@ jo@@ l took part in the construction of Gau@@ di &apos;s building Casa Mil@@ a and Park Gu@@ ell , which contains other Gau@@ di &apos;s works .
The locals started to call it the &quot; House of b@@ ones &quot; for its organic shapes soon after its completion .
Others began to call it a &quot; y@@ aw@@ ning house &quot; for its specific mechanism of windows opening .
It is also said that on top of the building there is a representation of the s@@ word of St. George , the pat@@ ron of Catal@@ onia .
Other sculp@@ tural elements of the building also contain hidden religious mo@@ tives .
Gau@@ di designed a central heating system in the house , unique for his time , with venti@@ lation and typical ch@@ im@@ neys .
Their fort@@ y-@@ five degree slope may seem bizarre .
When creating Gau@@ di totally dis@@ regarded building regulations of the time and did not let them tied him up .
At the start of construction he actually received a building permit from the city , but the provided details about the planned reconstruction were so vague , that two years after the completion the City Council was hor@@ ri@@ fied by the result and asked for red@@ ress .
Coun@@ c@@ il@@ ors did mind for example that the building inter@@ fer@@ ed with its pillars into the public side@@ walk .
The correction never happened , rather the opposite : only fifteen days after the request from the city , Jose@@ p Bat@@ ll@@ ó applied for ( and successfully received ) the permission to le@@ ase the top two floors of the building .
The owner himself moved to lower floors .
There was a ban@@ quet hall in the gallery on the second floor and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private section of the apartment .
The ground floor was le@@ ased to a je@@ wel@@ ry .
The entire six-@@ st@@ ori@@ ed building is inter@@ sec@@ ted by a sta@@ ir@@ case , which ends only at the roof terrace .
The key elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right ang@@ les and straight lines and replacing them with cur@@ ved walls .
Gau@@ d@@ í also worked with the modern concept of space inter@@ connection .
The social part is completely connected by opening the s@@ alo@@ on door and a larger group can comfortably communicate without losing the necessary privacy for intimate convers@@ ations .
The house won due to Gau@@ di &apos;s re@@ building a new fac@@ ade and also the unusual roof and two extra floors .
Gau@@ di &apos;s play with light is also impressive , along with blue and white gla@@ zed tiles used to line the inner courtyard and sky@@ lights .
The play of two colors delivers a maximum of light on all floors of the house .
It was enough to gam@@ ble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark colors , which absor@@ b the sun &apos;s rays on the contrary .
Casa Bat@@ ll@@ ó House , which was included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005 , can be visited by anyone .
The most spacious and most luxurious apartment has been opened to the public on the first floor .
The owners decided to move this up in 2002 to celebrate the one hundred fif@@ tieth anniversary of the birth of the famous author .
They kept providing the excursions since they discovered that this is a very profitable business , plus they extended tours by the common and at@@ tic spaces , including a roof terrace .
Ad@@ mission to the sight is certainly not neg@@ li@@ gible , amounts to 16.@@ 50 euros , while students , sen@@ iors , groups and travel passes holders receive a twenty percent discount .
The amount greatly exceed@@ s the price of admission to other Gau@@ di &apos;s buildings in the city .
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dra@@ gon towers , you have to quickly make friends with any of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit them at home .
How to choose the mat@@ t@@ ress and the s@@ lat@@ ted bed base : Women have different requirements from men
Not luxurious bed frame , but the quality of the lying area , that is the mat@@ t@@ ress and s@@ lat@@ ted bed base gives a really good bed .
They must however match in a harmon@@ ious way to suit a specific user .
The selection decisions are influenced by lots of things such as the weight , height , age , health , and gender of the owner .
Also the type of interior , into which the mat@@ t@@ ress and s@@ lat@@ ted base are purchased , is important .
A typical example ?
For instance for summer houses which are not heated regularly , lat@@ ex mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses are not suitable because they warm up rather slowly .
In addition , they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard poly@@ ur@@ eth@@ ane fo@@ am mat@@ t@@ ress .
It is also necessary to turn them regularly .
If they do not have enough v@@ enting channels in their core , and still lie on a hard board , they retain mo@@ ist@@ ure : Even m@@ old could occur ben@@ e@@ ath the mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses .
The choice is also influenced by hab@@ its .
Who spent more time abroad , where they often use very thick mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses with sof@@ tening layer , they will find it hard to feel good on a thin one with hard surface .
&quot; Perhaps all ho@@ ck@@ ey players returning from the N@@ H@@ L compl@@ ained to me that they were sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; Their batter@@ ed shoul@@ ders , he@@ els and hi@@ ps needed the mat@@ t@@ ress to be sof@@ tened with a layer of la@@ zy fo@@ am . &quot;
&quot; Those are recommended even for people with di@@ abetes who have a ner@@ vous system dis@@ order , so they assume &apos; information &apos; from the jo@@ ints and skin in an ill way , &quot; explains Sy@@ l@@ via H@@ ad@@ am@@ c@@ zi@@ ko@@ va , who speci@@ alizes in uph@@ ol@@ stered furniture .
She therefore looked for la@@ zy fo@@ am mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses for many ho@@ ck@@ ey players , but also other customers years ago .
&quot; Now it &apos;s ok@@ ay , suitable mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses can be found at Temp@@ ur , Italian Mag@@ ni@@ f@@ lex , but also Czech Tro@@ pic@@ o . &quot;
You need not be an N@@ H@@ L guy to appreciate the la@@ zy fo@@ am .
This &quot; mi@@ racle &quot; works in a simple manner .
Optim@@ iz@@ es its rigi@@ dity and shape by the heat absor@@ bed or adap@@ ts to your body warm .
You feel no press and will not keep changing position on your bed all night as if you were after a tough game .
You will just sleep better .
L@@ az@@ y fo@@ am also works well as a protection against pressure sor@@ es .
When choosing the size of your mat@@ t@@ ress thick@@ ness , add one foot length to your height , which is about 2@@ 1-@@ 34 cm .
Man and woman with a height of about 180 cm then need a bed of 2@@ 10-@@ 220 cm .
The minimum width for one should be 90@@ cm in double bed , i.e. 180 cm altogether .
In separate beds , for example for sing@@ les , it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm .
For both usual comfort and a possible visitor .
&quot; Otherwise the rule for bed width is simple : when lying on your back , you should keep your hands comfortably slightly b@@ ent at the el@@ bow , &quot; advis@@ es In@@ g . Hel@@ ena Pro@@ kop@@ ov@@ á , head of the Gu@@ ild of uph@@ ol@@ ster@@ ers and decor@@ ators , who has addressed the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonom@@ ics of furniture for many years and te@@ aches it to coll@@ eg@@ es .
For everyone needs their own mat@@ t@@ ress and a s@@ lat@@ ted base in a double bed , be careful to buy match the thick@@ ness of mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses when buying them .
Otherwise you will have to fit into s@@ lat@@ ted bases into different hei@@ ghts , which may not be possible with every frame of the bed .
Fo@@ am mat@@ t@@ ress should be at least 14 cm , while the frame types with a spring framework should be at least 15 cm , including at least three cen@@ tim@@ eters count for the shaping and sof@@ tening layer .
&quot; You must not feel the springs when tou@@ ching the mat@@ t@@ ress with hands or sitting down on the mat@@ t@@ ress , &quot; war@@ ns Hel@@ ena Pro@@ kop@@ ova .
Each mat@@ t@@ ress requires a certain type of s@@ lat@@ ted base .
U@@ ph@@ ol@@ stered beds , where the mat@@ t@@ ress and the foundation are like con@@ joined Si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , should not appear in bedrooms .
It is hard to air the mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses ; you can not w@@ ash the fabric either , which should be a must today .
And since we normally persp@@ ire 0.@@ 2 to 0.@@ 75 li@@ ters of swe@@ at during the night , it is obvious that after five to seven years the mat@@ t@@ ress will res@@ emble a large ( and c@@ log@@ ged ) si@@ eve .
That &apos;s why experts refuse advertising slo@@ gan@@ s of life of the mat@@ t@@ ress up to 25 years , or even a lifetime warranty .
Everything has its pro@@ s and cons .
Therefore , the practical advice from vend@@ ors is as follows : Do not give up hygiene for mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses with a width of 120 and 140 cm and their remo@@ vable and was@@ hab@@ le cover , rather add a mat@@ t@@ ress prot@@ ector , which can be easily removed and wash@@ ed .
Although today mat@@ t@@ ress covers are now commonly manufactured with a zip around the per@@ im@@ eter , so after opening you get two parts ( vital for washing and the size of washing machine ! ) , handling the larger types when removing them ( and in one person ) may remind of a match of ligh@@ t-@@ weight fi@@ ght@@ nig a heavy one in the ring .
Do you have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a s@@ lat@@ ted base ?
N@@ ever !
If so , then only in a bed for one-@@ night visitors .
The board should nevertheless be equipped ( if not already ) with venti@@ lation holes and use the mat@@ t@@ ress with spring framework of a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in the bags ( from German Ta@@ schen@@ feder@@ kern ) and a sof@@ tening layer .
Poly@@ ur@@ eth@@ ane mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses should not be on such a basis .
For non-@@ positioning s@@ lat@@ s with 14-@@ 18 bla@@ des , lat@@ ex or sand@@ wich mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses will be suitable ( maybe a combination of lat@@ ex and co@@ con@@ ut ) , but it always pays back to get the s@@ lat@@ ted bases with larger number of bla@@ des , 28 or more , where there are double bla@@ des in the l@@ um@@ bar area and their sti@@ ff@@ ness can be regulated .
M@@ att@@ res@@ ses with spring frames should not lie on adju@@ stable s@@ lat@@ s as they do not respond to positioning .
In addition to adju@@ sting the sti@@ ff@@ ness of s@@ lat@@ s you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cra@@ dle .
This is a special mounting of bla@@ des , which enables to push , or even ti@@ lt the plate so that the arm of the sle@@ eper would nicely &quot; fit into the mat@@ t@@ ress . &quot;
For men whose shoul@@ ders are &quot; all over their back , &quot; this is certainly an important thing .
Even mat@@ t@@ ress manufacturers respect it when in &quot; men &quot; mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses they began to use the sof@@ tening zone right in the shoulder area .
They also remember the women - those indul@@ ge in the sof@@ ter surface of the hip area .
A@@ il@@ eron or lam@@ ell@@ ar grat@@ ings with the so-called multi-@@ tor@@ sion suspension are intended for the most demanding customers .
The pressure is spread into several points and the tension reduces .
But be careful when you use a wrong pil@@ low with a correct mat@@ t@@ ress and s@@ lat@@ ted base ( large and &quot; stu@@ ff@@ ed &quot; ) , most of the &quot; pl@@ uses &quot; will disappear .
The basic rule is simple : The c@@ us@@ hion should support the head and touch the shoul@@ ders with its cor@@ ners so that the shoulder mus@@ cles could relax .
A suitable size of 50 x 60 c@@ m@@ is recommended , preferred for example in Scandinavi@@ a .
When lying on the side , the pil@@ low should be able to deal ( along with the shoulder cra@@ dle of the s@@ lat@@ ted bed or sof@@ tened zone in the mat@@ t@@ ress ) with shoulder height .
Modern mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses do have something in common with original mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses filled with gr@@ asses .
Their manufacturers increasingly use natural materials , or at least ad@@ mix@@ tures .
There is simply an organic trend even in mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses .
Ra@@ w materials from oil , out of which poly@@ ur@@ eth@@ ane fo@@ am is made , are being replaced with natural oils , such as from so@@ y and cast@@ or-@@ oil plant .
It is just so@@ y that all well-known manufacturers use now .
&quot; Organ@@ ic in mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses means that the core is made of purely natural material , &quot; explains Pet@@ r V@@ asi@@ c@@ ek from the company Tro@@ pic@@ o Plus .
Natural products are also used in the production of mat@@ t@@ ress covers , one of the first was alo@@ e ver@@ a .
But you can also indul@@ ge in micro@@ cap@@ s@@ ules that can release fresh sc@@ ent of la@@ ven@@ der or forest .
There is even a division for men and women .
While men are &quot; cool@@ ed &quot; by her@@ bal extract of bir@@ ch , so that the mat@@ t@@ ress cover would absor@@ b heat and cool the body , women are on the contrary &quot; war@@ med &quot; by the covers .
The extract of red p@@ ep@@ per increases circulation of blood , so the weaker sex feels war@@ mer .
Today &apos;s favor@@ ites ?
M@@ att@@ ress made of cold fo@@ am ( with larger por@@ es with a damaged cell structure is more breath@@ able than regular poly@@ ur@@ eth@@ ane and has a better el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity .
Com@@ bin@@ ing different sti@@ ff@@ nesses of cold fo@@ ams and &quot; la@@ zy &quot; fo@@ am result in multi-@@ zone mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses that know exactly where the head should be , as well as shoul@@ ders and he@@ els .
You will pay seven thousand crow@@ ns and above for a good quality mat@@ t@@ ress .
Those that meet health parameters tend to have lower rate of VAT as they are considered medical equipment .
Gum@@ ot@@ ex was the first to employ this advantage in the Czech Republic .
It is not easy to save on the mat@@ t@@ ress and the s@@ lat@@ ted base .
Sometimes you can use special offers of manufacturers or retail@@ ers , who offer two mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses for the price of one .
For instance Mag@@ ni@@ f@@ lex brand offers their Du@@ o@@ free@@ ze mat@@ t@@ ress with the memory fo@@ am Memory se@@ wn into the cover for 11 9@@ 90 crow@@ ns .
However , you can get the second one for free .
The era of la@@ zy or vis@@ co@@ el@@ astic fo@@ ams with open cell structure and high density was started by Temp@@ ur material in a &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic &quot; pace .
It was originally developed as a material for N@@ ASA because the a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts were exposed to enormous over@@ exter@@ tion during the start .
Temp@@ ur sof@@ tens when warm , but strength@@ ens in the cold .
It is then perfectly adapted to warm human body and spre@@ ads its pressure optim@@ ally .
It is therefore ideal to prevent pressure ul@@ c@@ er development , but also to enhance comfort while sleeping .
Vis@@ co@@ el@@ astic fo@@ ams are used not only for mat@@ t@@ res@@ ses , but also medical products , such as special pil@@ lows under the feet , which mitig@@ ate the legs and ven@@ ous system .
Dom@@ estic producers use the fo@@ am T@@ win@@ sa@@ ver or Eu@@ ca@@ ther@@ m C and such .
De@@ vi@@ ces for people monitoring are required by more and more parents , who want to watch their children
Fe@@ ar for their own child brings more people to the idea of watching them using GPS .
The system originally created to search for cars could also monitor the movement of people and thus should help in cases such as the dis@@ appearance of nin@@ e-@@ year-old An@@ nie Jan@@ at@@ kov@@ á .
The facility is currently of the size of a mat@@ ch@@ box , but it may soon be as big as a watch .
Many people have been scar@@ ed by the case of missing An@@ nie and thus began to search for ways to protect their children better .
Even at the cost of dis@@ ruption to their privacy .
&quot; We say to all that it is not sp@@ ying , but a means to further reduce the prob@@ ability that a tragedy happens , &quot; said Pet@@ r P@@ ili@@ n of the Mac@@ ro Weil , one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market .
&quot; I admit that under certain circumstances it may lead to mis@@ use of such equipment , if they are put in a bag of someone who does not know it , but we have not seen such cases yet . &quot;
&quot; Most customers actually buy it for security reasons , &quot; he added .
According to him , the child should always know for what the purpose of the &quot; box &quot; is and how it is used in an emergency .
Child psych@@ ologist D@@ ana Bo@@ č@@ kov@@ á points out that if a child does not want to wear something like that , it will just get rid of it .
&quot; Even very young children show great creativity how to lose some things on purpose if they do not want to be under control . &quot;
&quot; Great parents &apos; expectations were fu@@ eled by cell phones before , but those can be swit@@ ched off as well as this tracking device , &quot; says Bo@@ č@@ kov@@ á .
According to her it is question@@ able whether , in the event of an attack such a device would really help .
&quot; As for the upcoming kid@@ n@@ apping , the perpet@@ r@@ ator almost always ensures that the child should not carry any electronics that might reveal his position . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the phone now . &quot;
&quot; When tracking devices get more common , they will look for those , because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising . &quot;
&quot; In this case , the criminals are always one step ahead of police , &quot; says the psych@@ ologist .
She ad@@ mits , however , that similar devices may help in case of sudden attack by a ped@@ ophi@@ le .
According to Robert C@@ ech of R@@ C Monitoring Company that provides tracking services for both cars and for people , even when there is an attack and immediate destruction of the tracking device , its presence can help .
&quot; The device can be set to send regular position report after a certain period of time . &quot;
&quot; If it becomes damaged , we will have at least the last position of the person . &quot;
&quot; The more expensive devices have in-@@ built and til@@ t@@ meters , so even if one just ski@@ ds and remains lying mo@@ tion@@ less , the device immediately sends a warning with location , &quot; says Czech .
According to him a similar service may be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation , where it is enough to load a special software .
The problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device similar to p@@ end@@ ants of mat@@ ch@@ box size or smaller mobile phones .
There is always the risk of their loss .
According to P@@ ili@@ n from the Mac@@ ro Weil Company a device that looks like a conventional digital watch is now being tested .
&quot; This will be the biggest advantage that the aggres@@ sor may not even recognize the tracking device at all . &quot;
&quot; Or they recognize it after some time and it may give the police extra time , &quot; he adds .
Whether you the tracking devices develop into bra@@ cel@@ ets or p@@ end@@ ants , they are still using the same technology as that used for monitoring vehicles .
It is a combination of location detection via GPS ( used by regular car navigation ) and the functions of a mobile phone , which reports the current vehicle position .
The army has enough ign@@ iter cor@@ d to wind the whole of Czech Republic . But they will exp@@ ire in only two years .
Czech army has purchased 4@@ 45 kilometers of cor@@ ds , which det@@ on@@ ate explo@@ si@@ ves .
Already last year the Ministry of Defence delivered 2@@ 24 km of the cor@@ ds lines into the wareh@@ ouses .
The army thus has reserves for 2@@ 25 years .
The problem is that life of the lines is two to four years .
The Army purchased the det@@ on@@ ating cor@@ ds from S@@ TV Group , Inc. for C@@ Z@@ K 40 million .
The General Staff provided the reason@@ ing for buying such a huge quantity of ign@@ iter cor@@ ds to M@@ F D@@ nes stating that soldiers use 60 km of ign@@ iter cor@@ ds in training per year .
Cal@@ cul@@ ations of army bomb disposal experts that the M@@ F D@@ nes appro@@ ached imp@@ ly that it would be a very intense p@@ y@@ ro@@ techni@@ c training that would be under@@ gone also by all the gener@@ als every year , along with the officers of the army , secret@@ aries and clean@@ ers .
Def@@ ense Minister Alexand@@ r V@@ on@@ dr@@ a and army comm@@ ander V@@ las@@ tim@@ il P@@ ick included .
Only thus could be the army annual consumption of six@@ ty kilometers of ign@@ iter cor@@ ds justified .
This period corresponds to 25@@ ,000 explo@@ sions .
And even if it were true , the army reserves would be enough for more than ten years .
However , if the basic training of any new professional actually needed just two meters of the ign@@ iter cor@@ d , as the experts say , then the army has ensured by the purchase - even with increased consumption by engineer or special units - the stock for the above 2@@ 25 years .
Rap@@ id Dep@@ loyment Bri@@ g@@ ade soldiers personally compl@@ ained recently to the minister V@@ on@@ dr@@ a that they have almost no amm@@ uni@@ tion for small arms and so sho@@ ot@@ ings are limited due to shortage of money .
Not mentioning the lack of under@@ wear .
&quot; I do not understand either , that they buy so many ign@@ iter cor@@ ds from us repeatedly . &quot;
&quot; But it &apos;s their decision , and they certainly know what they will use them for . &quot;
&quot; For us , the army is a good customer , whose demands we try to meet as retail@@ ers , &quot; says the sales manager of S@@ TV Group , Jan D@@ ě@@ ck@@ ý .
Def@@ ense Ministry spo@@ kes@@ man Jan Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k reasons for the purchased hundreds of kilometers of cor@@ ds by creation reserves of such &quot; m@@ uni@@ tions &quot; for ten years at least .
Jan D@@ ě@@ ck@@ ý of S@@ TV Group , however , speaks only of the four-@@ year life of the cor@@ ds and police or army de@@ min@@ ers even of mere two years .
&quot; If stored under perfect conditions , it can be even four , &quot; said one , who as a soldi@@ er does not want to disc@@ lose the name when critici@@ zing the military .
After exp@@ iry date any amm@@ uni@@ tion must be carefully tested for reliability to make sure it does not end@@ anger the life of soldiers .
These tests are not free and it cost more money .
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount on 4@@ 45 km of the ig@@ ni@@ tion cor@@ ds .
&quot; It cost us about six@@ ty percent less than last year &apos;s supply of two hundred fort@@ y-@@ four kilometers , &quot; says the speaker Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k the opinion of bu@@ yers of the Ministry of Defence .
Just for comparison : Annual consumption of fir@@ ing lines of police de@@ min@@ ers who destroy m@@ uni@@ tions from World War II and the one left after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1500 meters for several years .
A police orders only such amount of the amm@@ uni@@ tion that would be used before its exp@@ ir@@ ation .
It paid back for the safety of de@@ min@@ ers and the flexibility to acquire more modern and thus more reliable types of lines .
Ministry of Defence has already considerable problems with the liqui@@ dation of tens of thousand tons of amm@@ uni@@ tion from the times of the Warsaw Pact , when the two-@@ hund@@ re@@ d-@@ thousand Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak army was preparing to set off for the Rhine .
The Czech one , according to the p@@ y@@ ro@@ techni@@ cians appro@@ ached by M@@ F D@@ nes , will face the same problem in a few years : They will dis@@ pose of hundreds of kilometers of old ign@@ iter cor@@ ds that are currently &quot; che@@ ap@@ ly &quot; purchased .
To this day I use the contacts I gained through the competition
W@@ inning the prize in the Ent@@ rep@@ rene@@ ur of the year helped Lu@@ kas Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n sell the fran@@ chise of his hotel .
The winner of last year &apos;s Ent@@ rep@@ rene@@ ur of the year was a twenty-@@ eigh@@ t-@@ year-old entreprene@@ ur Lu@@ kas Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n from Liber@@ ec .
His success story is much like one from a movie .
Lu@@ k@@ á@@ š Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n liked to travel .
And abroad he realized that Liber@@ ec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price .
Using his savings from foreign part-@@ time jobs and a bank loan he purchased a ru@@ ined house with five apartments .
It was a great courage considering that at that time he was still a student of the third year at university .
&quot; The ratio between quality and price of accommodation of the time in our country made me I try to do something , &quot; says Lu@@ kas Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n .
The first renovated apartment he r@@ ented to foreign workers .
All profits were invested back into the house , which he gradually remo@@ del@@ ed into a boarding house with 54 beds .
Since then , he has managed to gradually open four guest houses in Liber@@ ec within the seven years of his business , along with two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds across all categories of accommodation .
Until recently , the most comfortable one was Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n four-@@ star design hotel .
This year another one was open , equally good .
&quot; We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ost@@ ro@@ v u T@@ ise , where we sold our fran@@ chise concept and others interested in the Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n hotel fran@@ chise are applying , &quot; says last year &apos;s number one tra@@ der .
&quot; And the sale of the license to operate the hotel was very much influenced just by winning the competition Ent@@ rep@@ rene@@ ur of the year , &quot; appreci@@ atively adds Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n .
The victory brought more reputation and popularity in Liber@@ ec and its surroundings .
&quot; People recognized me in the streets , often addi@@ tionally congrat@@ ulated me and I must say it felt good , &quot; he rec@@ alls .
He strongly encourages all who are e@@ ager to try something to participate in the competition .
It is not necessary to win , any visibility is good .
He says he still draws on contacts and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , which would perhaps not get otherwise .
&quot; With some I &apos;ve met through the competition , I started a regular business . &quot;
In his opinion , the gl@@ ory associated with the success land@@ ed a bit on each employee .
And there are about s@@ event@@ y of them .
&quot; I see them show greater loy@@ alty and pride that they are involved in something that gained universal recognition . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s much more than just my personal success , as it is the result of good work of all of us together . &quot;
&quot; Only my name is thr@@ ust into the for@@ efront , &quot; says Lu@@ k@@ á@@ š Py@@ t@@ lou@@ n mo@@ dest@@ ly today .
I wish my successor qui@@ eter year than we had in Far@@ met
Eu@@ ph@@ oria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis .
With self-@@ discipline of the winner Far@@ met has already overcome bad times .
Prize for the first place in last year &apos;s V@@ od@@ af@@ one competition Company of the Year was in the Sla@@ v House collected by the owner of Far@@ met Company , Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which a small tool workshop in Ces@@ ka Sk@@ ali@@ ce grew into a business with hund@@ re@@ d-@@ million tur@@ no@@ vers .
&quot; I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for batt@@ les with the competition , &quot; says the la@@ st-@@ year winner today .
In the early history of the Far@@ met company there was a desire to do something useful .
And so , when the state offered the father of Charles Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ é@@ ho to rent a small workshop to compensate for the commun@@ ist@@ s-@@ conf@@ isc@@ ated property , he did not hesitate any long , rejected a career in the company , where he was working , and with a few friends around his father he founded the company producing plastic tu@@ bs .
So@@ on after that they began to speci@@ alize in vegetable oil pres@@ ses .
After eigh@@ teen years , they became the largest manufacturer of automatic pres@@ ses in Central Europe .
Gre@@ ater awareness among the general public was won after the success in the competition through the media .
&quot; Not only our customers have begun to perc@@ eive the brand Far@@ met much better , but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they work with a company that has achieved greater success in its home country , &quot; says Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
Last year , however , was not only full of the eu@@ ph@@ oria of vic@@ tories in F@@ AR@@ ME@@ T .
Awards were based on firm economic performance until 2008 and only partly from 2009 .
And just 2009 was the tou@@ gh@@ est year for the sale of engineering goods .
Cris@@ is was at its very peak , not tou@@ ching so many people yet , but companies had stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology .
&quot; The situation obviously did not spare us . &quot;
&quot; Sales fell by 40 percent , we had to restrict production and even discharge employees , &quot; explains Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
A viable company must be able to take even such un@@ popular measures sometimes .
However , they managed and retained the profit , even though lower than before the crisis .
However , what F@@ AR@@ ME@@ T would not compromise , is the investment in research and development .
&quot; With the help of subsidies we have built a research and training center , we have enhanced our presentation at international fairs , won major awards in local exhibitions , &quot; says Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
The crisis seems to be behind them .
R@@ even@@ ues are growing again and so is the number of new employees .
&quot; I wish the nice feeling of victory to the new winner , but in a more peaceful atmosphere , &quot; says Karel Ž@@ ď@@ á@@ r@@ sk@@ ý .
Sur@@ v@@ ey that remo@@ ves absurd regulations
Pol@@ l of the Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties is a part of the business competition for the fourth time .
Some ridicul@@ ous regulations have are already been removed .
In@@ famous winner of next year &apos;s Pol@@ l of Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties was the absurd obligation to bring documents that are accessible for officials online to the authorities .
It was chosen by more than a third of almost four thousand votes .
For example , Social Security Administration required a paper certificate of incorpor@@ ation , although the officer can obtain one by two cli@@ cks of a mouse .
Thanks to the pol@@ l , this will change .
&quot; The Czech Social Security Administration will not require the certificate of incorpor@@ ation from for controls of contribut@@ ors , &quot; said spo@@ kes@@ man Jan@@ a Bur@@ á@@ ň@@ ov@@ á of C@@ SS@@ A .
To cra@@ ck down on all the rules and regulations that companies and businesses in the Czech Republic must meet , and remove those that lack sense , is the essence of the Pol@@ l of Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties .
This is the fourth time this year , it has been a part of the business competition , held by Ho@@ spo@@ d@@ á@@ ř@@ sk@@ é nov@@ iny and it is becoming increasingly popular among the public .
If about three thousand voters were involved in the vote last year , there were nearly four thousand voters earlier this year .
And not surpris@@ ingly , there are still many legal obligations , which only serve to delay the business .
&quot; For instance in the number of papers required for tax returns we keep the top places in the world , &quot; said Karel Hav@@ lic@@ ek of the Association of Small and Medi@@ um-@@ sized Enter@@ prises and Cra@@ fts in CR .
Simp@@ li@@ fication of business has in recent years become a stated objective of all governments .
But compared with the rest of the world the situation has not really improved in the Czech Republic .
According to the World Bank , in terms of business conditions the Czech Republic was ran@@ ked 7@@ 4th position ; it is eight points less than last year .
The Pol@@ l of Ab@@ sur@@ di@@ ties was first launched in 2006 and takes place every year under the same scenario .
Anyone may propose administrative and bureaucratic n@@ ons@@ enses every year from April to September , when is there is the deadline for the competition .
In order to sign for the competition , website H@@ Y@@ PER@@ LIN@@ K &quot; http : / / www.@@ fir@@ mar@@ ok@@ u.@@ cz &quot; is to be used . Organ@@ izer then choo@@ ses the seven candidates for the &quot; anti-@@ award &quot; and allows the public vote for it in October at the website www.@@ fir@@ mar@@ ok@@ u.@@ cz / absur@@ di@@ ta and www.@@ ih@@ ne@@ d.@@ c@@ z.
The absur@@ dity that gets most votes wins .
In this survey more than a hundred , 105 to be precise , meaning@@ less rules and regulations were filed .
Ti@@ ps were received from entrepreneurs , but also professional associations and journalists .
Among the &quot; fin@@ alists &quot; of the contest was for instance the requirement that the trucks for maintenance of high@@ ways were to pay ro@@ ad-@@ t@@ olls , or that businesses with twenty employees , two offices and two toil@@ ets had those painted every two years .
The list of this year &apos;s seven proposals is posted on the website of the contest .
An@@ no@@ unc@@ ement of the competition , which always takes place in early November on Wen@@ c@@ es@@ las Square in Prague is part of the ha@@ p@@ enn@@ ing , regularly attended by person@@ alities of the political and social life .
This year , for example , the fin@@ ale of the competition was assisted by E@@ va Sv@@ obo@@ do@@ va , director of the Association of Small and Medi@@ um-@@ sized Enter@@ prises and Cra@@ fts in CR and Pet@@ r Ku@@ zel , president of the Chamber of Commerce in CR .
&quot; Economic prosperity can not work where the state is thro@@ wing business in its own foot , so my goal is to annually remove at least three do@@ zen paragraphs , which today only un@@ necessarily complic@@ ate the business , &quot; said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Ko@@ cour@@ ek .
E@@ f@@ forts to abo@@ lish meaning@@ less regulations has rather positive load .
In 2007 most people were against the obligation of a business to report their intention to take part at the exhibition or fair with their stand three days ahead to the trade office at the place where its permanent establishment is located .
This has been removed by an amendment to the Trade Act .
The second most voted obligation in 2007 , which was reporting a business trip of foreign staff lasting up to 30 days to the Labour Office , was removed by the so-called Green Card Act .
And last but not least .
Ab@@ sur@@ dity of 2009 was the obligation of physi@@ o@@ therap@@ ists to have a large mirror , a refriger@@ ator and two step@@ ping sc@@ ales in the office .
It was mitig@@ ated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refriger@@ ator has been removed .
New category recogni@@ zes socially responsible companies
Environmental , humanitarian , educational and sports projects are considered .
New in the fifth year of H@@ N Da@@ ily competition is the category called the Respon@@ sible Company in 2010 .
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business .
&quot; We want this to support companies that reflect their business &quot; impact on the environment and encourage socially responsible activities , &quot; says Patri@@ k Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ dy , regional manager of V@@ od@@ af@@ one mobile operator company , which is the promot@@ er and guarant@@ or of the competition , as well as in the case of the re@@ bel competition .
In the first year of this special sub@@ category of the main V@@ od@@ af@@ one competition Company of the year 2010 , companies , for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal , signed for the competition .
Each story is very inspir@@ ational and would be enough for a separate article .
Although the nature of their activities varies considerably , the common den@@ omin@@ ator of their efforts may be the support and thou@@ ght@@ ful@@ ness .
In one case , for example , it relates to people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or health of their employees .
Among the four@@ teen fin@@ alists in CR we find a Pra@@ gu@@ e-@@ located software company E@@ t Net@@ era who supports the creation of informal sports teams of staff which then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports .
Another example of a responsible company from the Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce region is the company I@@ soli@@ t-@@ Bra@@ vo , who has been a major contribut@@ or to the end@@ ow@@ ment fund for handic@@ apped children for s@@ event@@ een years .
Old mill of Po@@ deb@@ ra@@ dy then takes care of their disabled employees , who are more than 70 percent of the whole staff , and was thus awarded with the title of Respon@@ sible Company in the Central Boh@@ em@@ ia Region and won the third place in the V@@ od@@ af@@ one competition Company of the year .
In the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region the award was received by Mi@@ Ry@@ z Soft accounting firm , which has introduced flexible working hours in addition to the reduced average 35 hours per week but did not reduce sal@@ ary proportion@@ ately .
The title was also awarded to the company because they prefer@@ ably buy from Czech manufacturers , promote civi@@ c activities in the neighborhood and protect the environment .
&quot; We try to recy@@ cle as much as possible so that our business and our administration had the least impact on the environment , &quot; explains the executive Mil@@ use Ry@@ zn@@ aro@@ v@@ á .
Respon@@ sible IT Company En@@ log@@ it in the Ú@@ st@@ í region then thinks about the health of its employees , and for each laptop purchased they bought ergonom@@ ic chairs and key@@ boards , support their work from home and use catering services provided by a local shel@@ tered workshop for their corporate events .
&quot; In addition , we support the People in Ne@@ ed Foundation , which helps the local Roma community in particular , &quot; says company representative On@@ dre@@ j Such@@ y .
Finally , worth not@@ ing is also the activity of P@@ ran@@ í a č@@ i@@ š@@ t@@ ě@@ n@@ í Company of the Kar@@ lov@@ y V@@ ary region , which contributes its employees with bon@@ uses to their pension schemes .
&quot; We provide allow@@ anced for meals , transport , up@@ sk@@ illing and recreation , &quot; says Josef St@@ rap@@ á@@ č from Br@@ unt@@ á@@ l Cz@@ as@@ ch construction company , the winner in the Mor@@ avi@@ a@@ -S@@ il@@ es@@ ian Region .
For the Respon@@ sible Company of the Year category were automatically en@@ rolled all regional fin@@ alists of V@@ od@@ af@@ one Company of the Year competition , who answered the question@@ n@@ aire attached to the application and sent it to organiz@@ ers until 15 August .
In@@ correctly filled or incomplete answers to the question@@ n@@ aire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiz@@ er .
&quot; If the representatives of competing companies failed to answer the questions , they could not attend the Respon@@ sible Company of the Year Competition , but are not dis@@ qualified from the &quot; main &quot; V@@ od@@ af@@ one competition Company of the Year . &quot;
&quot; Single sign just for this competition is not possible because it is a sub@@ category of the main competition Company of the year , &quot; explains Karel Gold@@ man of the organizing agency B@@ ison &amp; Rose .
Police made arres@@ ts at the Land Fund in Pl@@ zen during the ten@@ dering procedure
In recent days the anti-@@ corruption police made arres@@ ts at the building of the Land Fund in Pil@@ sen .
Hand@@ cu@@ ffs were put by det@@ ectives to a local entreprene@@ ur in the media sector and real estate dealer , Lu@@ bo@@ š G.
He alle@@ ge@@ dly attempted to manip@@ ulate the current tender for the settlement of res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion claims , so that the land offered was awarded to a particular candidate .
He was supposed to pay half a million to Lu@@ bo@@ š G.
So far I can only confirm that the police prosec@@ ute one person for the offen@@ se of frau@@ dul@@ ent manipulation of public procurement and public ten@@ ders , &quot; said the head of Pil@@ s@@ ner prosec@@ ution Ant@@ onie Z@@ el@@ en@@ á to Pra@@ vo , adding that the additional details with respect to ongoing investigations can not be released .
The 4@@ 6-@@ year-old entreprene@@ ur was released by police after 24 hours .
Due to a low of official information we can only spec@@ ulate how one could manip@@ ulate the tender .
A spo@@ kes@@ man of the Land Fund L@@ ub@@ om@@ í@@ ra Č@@ ern@@ á rep@@ lied to the question by Pra@@ vo that police actually made arres@@ ts at a det@@ ached workplace in Pl@@ zen , namely during the public ten@@ dering procedure .
&quot; It was a client , not our employee , &quot; she said .
The public tender , according to M@@ s. C@@ ern@@ a , is called &quot; Inv@@ itation to tender for the transfer of land rights under the Land@@ s Act &quot; and takes place when more eligible candidates are interested in the land offered .
&quot; These people within the call offer a higher value of their res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion claims to be settled by the transfer than the announced value of the land . &quot;
&quot; By the claims offered the order of the acqu@@ ir@@ ers is set and Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims , &quot; said fund spo@@ kes@@ man .
Mr Lu@@ bo@@ š G. probably had information , who rep@@ lied to the call , and since he is also a benefici@@ ary , because he has bought a number of res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion claims , he suggested to another candidate not to participate .
The candidate probably received financial compensation .
That would explain that he was det@@ ained with such a large sum of money .
Lu@@ bo@@ s G had superior contacts to L@@ F already in the past .
He figur@@ ed in the case of former chief of L@@ F Vac@@ la@@ v San@@ ko@@ t , who was prosec@@ uted for transferring lands in the sub@@ stitu@@ tional land res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , on which a decision on the location of a building has already been issued .
It was just then when Mr Lu@@ bo@@ s G. acquired lands intended for the construction of public roads from the fund , particularly at the point where the dri@@ ve@@ way was to be built to the industrial zone Bor@@ ska pole .
Later , he very conveniently ex@@ changed those with the city for a house in the historic town center , which had a much higher value .
Town hall had to accept it then , because otherwise it would block the construction by blocking the lands .
H@@ ous@@ ehol@@ ds will pay extra hundreds for housing a month
H@@ ous@@ ehol@@ ds will have to pay more since January , not only for all types of energy , but also for water and se@@ wer@@ age , heating supplies , and r@@ ents will rise in certain areas .
Famili@@ es will have to pull out monthly hundreds more from pur@@ ses from January .
The price of electricity will be raised up by 4.@@ 6 percent ; gas will be about 2 percent more expensive , in some towns you will have to pay extra for water by up to a ten@@ th and supply of central heating will often be more expensive .
Electri@@ city price increase should cost hou@@ should s in the flat@@ s hundreds of crow@@ ns a year more than now .
Prices of power energy were reduced by all the major suppliers at the same time ; a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources , especially photo@@ volta@@ ics , is to blame then .
Although gas will only be slightly more expensive , it will happen when most people are heating their flat@@ s and thus have the highest consumption .
An@@ nu@@ ally they must then also take extra costs in account .
While electricity and gas will be more expensive across the country , central heating price change varies from place to place .
Price increase is planned mainly in larger municip@@ alities .
For example , households in Par@@ du@@ bi@@ ce and H@@ ra@@ dec Kr@@ alo@@ ve will pay since January for central heating about C@@ Z@@ K 50 per month extra , families in Liber@@ ec will pay extra C@@ Z@@ K 1,000 a year .
Res@@ idents of Prague may have more expensive water and se@@ wer by more than 9 percent , in the event that the city increases the rent of the infrastructure .
If the rent does not change , Prague residents will pay extra 6.@@ 8 percent .
Price in Prague , however , will still be in a nation@@ wide comparison rather low .
In the North Boh@@ em@@ ia , where prices are already among the highest , the water rate should increase by about 7.@@ 4 percent .
For example , the price of rent in 450 thousands of rental apartments , where regulation ends in January , may significantly increase .
For example , CP@@ I By@@ ty , which in U@@ sti n@@ ad Lab@@ em owns about 2,@@ 500 apartments , plans to raise the rent from January by up to one hundred percent .
The company intends to bring to the court those who will not accept the new r@@ ents .
Reg@@ ulated r@@ ents paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year .
Czech children get dr@@ unk with Fern@@ et and R@@ um . Be@@ er is out of fashion , it works slowly .
Fern@@ et , rum , vod@@ ka , exceptionally better brand of wh@@ is@@ key st@@ olen from parents .
These are the drinks , after which most often dr@@ un@@ ks not even of the age of fifteen end in physi@@ cians &quot; care .
Children who are treated for dr@@ unk@@ enness at the hospital repeatedly are not an exception .
This follows the experience of physi@@ cians who are confronted with similar cases in the ad@@ missions of patients to children departments of hospitals .
&quot; Be@@ er or wine is completely un@@ fashionable , as it takes a long time before they get dr@@ unk . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ qu@@ or is the trend of today , that is for sure , &quot; said the head of children &apos;s ward in Hor@@ o@@ vice Hospital in central Boh@@ em@@ ia , Lu@@ de@@ k Pel@@ ican to Pra@@ vo .
&quot; If they can pull out a bottle of their father from the clos@@ et , it is usually the wh@@ is@@ key , but otherwise Fern@@ et and vod@@ ka domin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; V@@ od@@ ka has the advantage that it is served in juice and they may not smell so badly then , &quot; said the head physi@@ cian .
And this is confirmed by the speaker of the Fac@@ ul@@ ty Hospital Mot@@ ol , E@@ va Jur@@ in@@ ov@@ á .
&quot; It is Fern@@ et or rum most often . &quot;
&quot; It is today a modern spirit , especially in primary schools . &quot;
&quot; In some cases , it was a pl@@ um brand@@ y , which they have brought from home , &quot; said Jur@@ in@@ ov@@ á .
According to the head physi@@ cian P@@ eli@@ k@@ án are thir@@ te@@ en- or four@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old drin@@ kers admitted to hospital a relatively common phenomenon .
Before Ho@@ ř@@ o@@ vice , where he has been since this year , he worked for ten years just in pedi@@ atri@@ cs department in Mot@@ ol , where am@@ bul@@ ances bring befu@@ dd@@ led school@@ children from the surrounding area .
&quot; One girl was admitted to our hospital four times . &quot;
&quot; She started her career at the age of twelve , when she was brought to us with a 3.5 per mil@@ le of alcohol in the blood , in addition in combination with ec@@ st@@ as@@ y , &quot; the doctor describes a particularly serious case .
&quot; She had attended a dance party and V@@ yst@@ avi@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; It is interesting that her mother did not find at all strange that she had not seen her daughter for 48 hours , &quot; said the chief physi@@ cian .
It is the dis@@ interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking problems of their own off@@ spring is considered a major cause of increasing children boo@@ zing .
It is however not an ad@@ diction in the true sense in the case of children according to experts .
&quot; Under the term alcoho@@ lic we understand a multi-@@ year chronic ad@@ diction to alcohol with all the related phenomena , which does not apply to children . &quot;
&quot; For those who use alcohol frequently , it is more associated with un@@ successful family-@@ social background , &quot; said the head physi@@ cian P@@ eli@@ kan .
According to spo@@ kes@@ woman Jur@@ in@@ ov@@ á about for@@ ty dr@@ unken children have this year been hosp@@ itali@@ zed at the pedi@@ atri@@ c clin@@ ic in Mot@@ ol until mid-@@ November .
The statistics , however , receive only those with severe in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation who had to stay in the hospital .
Child dr@@ un@@ ks , who are taken home after out@@ patient treatment by their parents or the police , are not counted .
Exc@@ ept where kids just sit around after school and drink a bottle of brand@@ y , according to P@@ eli@@ kan , there are three seasonal fluctu@@ ations , which one can rely on : Wit@@ ch Fe@@ ast , New Year and the end of the school year .
&quot; It &apos;s either to w@@ ash down the s@@ ad@@ ness from bad school report , conver@@ sely , to celebrate the start of the holiday . &quot;
&quot; But I experienced seven dr@@ unk children admitted to hospital at the same time during the wit@@ ch fe@@ ast &quot; said P@@ eli@@ kan .
The dr@@ unk , who sp@@ ends the night with det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication under medical supervision , is paradox@@ ically in an advantage compared to that one at home , who suff@@ ers from un@@ pleasant han@@ go@@ ver the next day .
Mor@@ ning head@@ aches caused by de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation and lack of glu@@ co@@ se are prevented by ir@@ rig@@ ation in@@ fusion with glu@@ co@@ se and nutri@@ ents that the body is lacking .
&quot; They are actually doing better because they have the beautiful evening experience and a good wake up when nothing hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Only they are confused about where they are , &quot; said P@@ eli@@ kan , adding that he sometimes spo@@ ils the pleasant mood of the patients by at least a list of costs that their treatment required .
Transport by am@@ bul@@ ance and being hosp@@ itali@@ zed on an acute bed costs thousands of crow@@ ns .
&quot; Sometimes I used this as an educational measure , when I directly to those children calculated how much it cost that they became dr@@ unk , and that they could also spend the summer working to make money to cover this one party , &quot; said P@@ eli@@ kan .
In@@ surance companies , however , do not take reg@@ ression procedures in which the parents should cover the cost of treatment in cases of child dr@@ un@@ ks .
Two L-@@ 15@@ 9 air@@ cra@@ fts are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-@@ 15@@ 9 of a total of five pieces for which the Czech Def@@ ense Ministry has ex@@ changed transport aircraft C@@ ASA C-@@ 29@@ 5@@ M , fle@@ w on Tuesday to Seville , where is based the manufacturer of Casa air@@ cra@@ fts - EADS .
It is the first time that air@@ cra@@ fts of this type appeared in the possession of someone else than the Czech army .
They have only been abroad for training and demonstration flights .
It is a two-@@ seat version of the L-@@ 15@@ 9@@ T@@ 1 aircraft , which has been operated by Czech army and were air@@ worthy .
The remaining three are single-@@ L-@@ 15@@ 9 .
Those are still standing in A@@ ero Vo@@ do@@ cho@@ dy and the bro@@ ker - the company Om@@ ni@@ pol - took them over only last week .
It has not been released when the air@@ cra@@ fts will physi@@ cally leave Vo@@ do@@ cho@@ dy , according to Jan Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k of the Press Department of Ministry of Def@@ ense .
&quot; Sing@@ le-@@ seat L-@@ 15@@ 9 have been allocated for the exchange from long-@@ stored aircraft , and without any deposits and investments by the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; Tw@@ o-@@ seat L-@@ 15@@ 9@@ T@@ 1 air@@ cra@@ fts were ex@@ changed in the current condition and form , &quot; Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k told Pra@@ vo .
He added that the army will not be left without a two-@@ seat aircraft , because in May 2009 the mini@@ stry signed a contract worth 200 million crow@@ ns with A@@ ero Vo@@ do@@ cho@@ dy for the reconstruction of four redundant L-@@ 15@@ 9 machines into two two-@@ seat machines .
One new aircraft was taken by the army in July ; the other will be taken over until the end of this year .
According to Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k EADS has committed to enforce the aircraft as equipment to some Alliance countries .
&quot; The contract clearly states that the purchaser of the L-@@ 15@@ 9 is the EADS company and they will be used for training pil@@ ots from NATO countries . &quot;
&quot; How to implement this thing is therefore an issue for customers &quot; said Pe@@ j@@ se@@ k .
Ho@@ spo@@ d@@ á@@ ř@@ sk@@ é nov@@ iny recently reported that the Spanish army is not interested in L-@@ 15@@ 9 .
The exchange of five L-@@ 15@@ 9 air@@ cra@@ fts for one Casa aircraft and purchase of three more air@@ cra@@ fts worth 3.5 billion was approved by government of Mi@@ re@@ k Top@@ ol@@ an@@ ek last year .
Ministry of Defence did not organize any tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly .
The former leadership of Ministry of Def@@ ense argued that the exchange would promote further exports of L-@@ 15@@ 9 abroad .
Czech Army has purchased 72 air@@ cra@@ fts from A@@ ero and uses only 24 ; they would like to sell the remaining ones .
Purch@@ ase of Casa air@@ cra@@ fts will probably have judicial implications .
The European Commission has su@@ ed the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court because the air@@ cra@@ fts were to be selected on the basis of a European tender and not addressing only one manufacturer .
The Army has already acquired three Casa air@@ cra@@ fts , the last one should arrive in Prague , airport K@@ b@@ ely , within a fort@@ night .
Having index finger longer than ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index finger than ring finger are at lower risk of pro@@ state cancer .
It is a surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Canc@@ er .
This may be related to the level of the male hor@@ m@@ one test@@ o@@ ster@@ one .
&quot; Our results show that the relative finger length may serve as a simple test for pro@@ state cancer risk , especially for a man up to 60 years , &quot; said study &apos;s co-@@ author R@@ os E@@ el@@ es , Professor at the Institute for Canc@@ er Research at the University of War@@ wick .
The finger could then help determine which men should under@@ go tests for pro@@ state cancer , particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden , she said .
In the period 199@@ 4-@@ 2009 she along with her colleagues monitored more than 1,@@ 500 patients with pro@@ state cancer in Britain and in parallel over three thousand healthy men .
More than a half of the study participants had a shorter index finger on their right hand than their ring finger .
The same prob@@ ability of pro@@ state cancer applied to them as for 19 percent of those whose f@@ ing@@ ers were of equal length .
For those who have the index finger longer than ring finger this risk decre@@ ased by 33 percent , while for men up to their six@@ ties it was even an 87 percent decline .
The ratio of the length of those two f@@ ing@@ ers - formed in the p@@ ren@@ at@@ al period - probably reflects different levels of sex hormon@@ es to which the child is exposed in the wom@@ b .
L@@ ess test@@ o@@ ster@@ one corresponds to a longer index finger .
Pre@@ vious studies have shown that it is the test@@ o@@ ster@@ one that supports pro@@ state cancer development .
Le@@ ading gene@@ tic@@ ist and former Czech President of Academy of Sciences Professor Vac@@ la@@ v P@@ aces said for Č@@ T@@ K that he knows about the study but in his opinion the relationship between the length of the f@@ ing@@ ers and the cancer does not seem to be &quot; fully proven . &quot;
The Czech Republic is covered with snow , D@@ 1 and D@@ 5 are closed
Czech Republic , like most of Europe , wo@@ ke up covered in snow on Thursday morning .
The roads and p@@ av@@ ements are mostly covered with comp@@ acted snow , in many places road maintenance stuff dro@@ ve all night .
D@@ 5 between the 8@@ 9th and 9@@ 3rd kilom@@ eter in the direction of Ro@@ z@@ v@@ ad@@ ov has been closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and D@@ 1 is also blocked in the direction from Br@@ no to Prague .
News were informed by the central dispat@@ cher of Autom@@ ot@@ ok@@ lub ( U@@ AM@@ K ) .
At the 9@@ 1st kilom@@ eter truck cr@@ ashed , at the 9@@ 3rd kilom@@ eter two trucks col@@ li@@ ded , the accident included injury .
Also several cars ended up in a di@@ t@@ ch .
Problems are also on the D@@ 1 highway at the 18@@ 5th kilom@@ eter in the direction of Prague .
Two trucks have col@@ li@@ ded there .
Dri@@ vers should leave the highway just after Br@@ no at the 19@@ 0@@ th kilom@@ eter or go through Br@@ no and drive back to the highway at the 18@@ 2nd kilom@@ eter at K@@ ý@@ val@@ ka .
There are car qu@@ eu@@ es several kilometers long .
Also , there is an accident at D@@ 11 , at the very arrival in Prague .
There is a layer of snow , several cen@@ tim@@ eters thick , in Prague , the ther@@ mom@@ eter shows min@@ us seven degrees Cel@@ si@@ us .
There are qu@@ eu@@ es of cars in Pro@@ se@@ k , Š@@ t@@ ě@@ r@@ b@@ oh@@ ol@@ sk@@ á is also blocked .
The most reliable means of transport is the subway .
Tr@@ ams run delayed between Charles Square and Nam@@ esti Mir@@ u .
At eight in the morning Prague emergency staff should meet once again .
Also railways and airports must are facing the problems .
Czech Rail@@ ways have had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow .
There are problems with the railway line from Prague to Kr@@ al@@ up@@ y or from Prague to Ber@@ ou@@ n .
Pass@@ engers should check the current situation .
Ru@@ zy@@ ne airport was closed from 11 pm Wednesday night to 5 a.@@ m ..
Most of the roads in southern Mor@@ avi@@ a are now pass@@ able , but only with caution .
There are three im@@ pass@@ able side roads in the V@@ y@@ š@@ ko@@ v area , there is loads of snow in the Br@@ no area and snow chains are necessary for travelling on certain communications in higher parts of Blan@@ sko region .
The most affected sites included the V@@ y@@ sk@@ ov area .
There are closed roads still : R@@ ous@@ í@@ no@@ v - S@@ lav@@ ko@@ v , Boh@@ d@@ ali@@ ce - Ku@@ č@@ ero@@ v and also Š@@ ar@@ ati@@ ce - Mi@@ le@@ š@@ o@@ vice .
For their extension rou@@ ters will be deployed .
It is impossible to estimate when they will be pass@@ able again .
In the Ho@@ don@@ in area , caution is necessary when travelling in the White Car@@ pa@@ thi@@ ans .
On roads that are there in order to protect the environment just kept pass@@ able with in@@ ert fill , there is a 5-@@ cen@@ tim@@ eter layer of snow , said Č@@ T@@ K .
In the Czech Republic from two to ten cen@@ tim@@ eters of snow has fallen , most in northern Boh@@ em@@ ia , often up to 18 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
In the Mor@@ avi@@ a@@ -S@@ il@@ es@@ ian Region about 15 cen@@ tim@@ eters of snow has occurred .
Snow@@ fall in the Czech Republic gradually ce@@ ases .
American troops have a new &quot; smart weapon &quot;
The U.S. Army deployed a new &quot; smart weapon &quot; in Afghanistan , known so far only by a co@@ den@@ ame X@@ M-@@ 25 .
The gener@@ als hope that the new automatic rif@@ le will affect the conflict with the Taliban and &quot; change the game &quot; in their favor .
The new weapon is like a super@@ accurate small c@@ ann@@ on .
Their proj@@ ec@@ tile is directed by a laser to hit within a few meters .
Special amm@@ uni@@ tion cali@@ ber 25 mm , designed for this rif@@ le and containing high explo@@ sive , in fact , act like little gr@@ en@@ ades .
The proj@@ ec@@ tiles can be programm@@ ed to explo@@ de when h@@ itting the target , but at any point of their bal@@ li@@ stic path .
They can be used against an enemy who is hi@@ ding behind a barrier , behind walls or in tr@@ en@@ ches .
These are usually not protected from the above , and if hit by the rain of de@@ adly sh@@ ards of steel , they may not fight any more .
According to Richard Au@@ d@@ etta who participated in the development of X@@ M-@@ 25 rif@@ le , it is a new first weapon for the inf@@ an@@ try , which uses &quot; smart &quot; technology .
&quot; The soldi@@ er basically operates it as follows : they find a target , it sends a laser be@@ am to determine the distance and thus the precise explanation of the point , they adjust the elev@@ ation and squ@@ ee@@ ze the trigger . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s say that you have obtained 5@@ 43 meters . &quot;
&quot; When you squ@@ ee@@ ze the trigger , the gun charges , and fires a missi@@ le at a distance of 5@@ 43 meters plus or min@@ us one , two or three meters , &quot; said Au@@ det@@ te .
400 jobs reloc@@ ated
The Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su cor@@ poration is reloc@@ ating its Bad Hom@@ burg office to Frankfurt .
In July of next year , 400 employees will move from the current office building on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square in Bad Hom@@ burg to Frankfurt &apos;s A@@ stro Park .
The Japanese Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su cor@@ poration is reloc@@ ating its Bad Hom@@ burg office to Frankfurt .
The industry giant in computers and computer maintenance announced on Wednesday that 400 men and women are to move from the current office building on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square in Bad Hom@@ burg to Frankfurt &apos;s A@@ stro Park in July of next year . The A@@ stro Park is a large office complex on Lyon Street in Frankfurt &apos;s Nieder@@ rad district .
A spo@@ kes@@ woman for Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su explained that , in the medium term , a further 100 cor@@ poration employees currently spread across the region will join the Frankfurt office .
The rental offer had been extremely attractive and the open-@@ plan office in the A@@ stro Park was better suited to the way employees actually work , the spo@@ kes@@ woman added .
Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su had also only been r@@ enting the office in Bad Hom@@ burg .
The manager responsible for the move , Bern@@ d Wag@@ ner , said , &quot; in Frankfurt Nieder@@ rad , we have found a central location with outstanding infrastructure . &quot;
The excellent connection to the airport was of particular significance to a global company such as Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su , he added .
Yesterday the coming reloc@@ ation of an important company within the region was a cause for joy among the winners and disappointment among the lo@@ sers .
Markus Frank ( CD@@ U ) , head of Frankfurt &apos;s department of economic affairs , said the city had once again attracted a global player ,
which was a &quot; fantastic acknowled@@ gement of the city . &quot;
He believed the city would suit Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su and that the move would be a significant boost for Nieder@@ rad .
Michael Kor@@ wis@@ i ( Greens ) , Mayor of Bad Hom@@ burg , expressed his regret at Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su &apos;s decision .
He said the city had been informed of the intended move by the company &apos;s management board well in advance .
&quot; We offered the company our help , as a matter of course , &quot; said Kor@@ wis@@ i .
The am@@ ic@@ able meetings , however , had no effect on the difficulties between the computer manufacturer and the land@@ l@@ ord for the property on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square .
Economic reasons had finally ti@@ pped the balance .
Kor@@ wis@@ i now wants to focus on preventing such a prominent location from remaining vac@@ ant long-term .
&quot; I hope the building &apos;s owner and land@@ l@@ ord will cooperate . &quot;
The building previously used by Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su on the town hall square and the neighbouring low-@@ rise &quot; Kleine Ver@@ tik@@ ale &quot; were among a number of buildings on Mari@@ en@@ bad Square that were part of the controversial building project by the spa town ten years ago .
The joint project between the city and a private project developer served to create a new entrance into the city between the train station and town hall , which attracted criticism on account of the massive scale of development over areas previously partly used for parking , and on account of the height of the buildings .
In 2001 , three companies moved in : Feri , the investment consultancy management and rating company , Start Ama@@ de@@ us , the travel sales and marketing systems software manufacturer , and Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su , the computer maker ( still linked to Siemens at the time ) .
The buildings used by Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfur@@ t-@@ based DI@@ C Group and the Morgan Stan@@ ley Real Estate Fund and sold on to Spanish Fal@@ con Real Estate Invest@@ ments SA in Madrid one year later .
The Tok@@ y@@ o-@@ based Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su cor@@ poration s@@ ells itself as the third largest IT provider in the world .
It provides companies with computers , servers and other equipment and provides necessary servi@@ cing .
The office in the Rhein@@ -@@ Main area is one of the largest in Germany , although Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su has considerably more employees in Munich .
The Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su subsidiary , Technology Solutions , is also moving from Bad Hom@@ burg to Frankfurt ; two further subsidiaries , Fu@@ j@@ it@@ su Services and a company named T@@ DS , will also be based in Frankfurt .
7@@ 000 square metres have been r@@ ented in the A@@ stro Park office building to accommodate them .
The twenty-@@ year-old complex - its name inspired by the star@@ -@@ shaped ground plan - is already home to the Central Association of the German Electri@@ cal and Electron@@ ics Industry ( Z@@ V@@ E@@ I ) and other organisations .
Ama@@ zon blocks server - threats against Ass@@ ange
Wiki@@ le@@ aks is getting into deeper and deeper waters .
The e-@@ commerce company Ama@@ zon has banned the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower from its servers .
Political pressure may stand behind the move following publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispat@@ ches .
The founder of Wiki@@ le@@ aks , Ass@@ ange , is believed to be in England .
The whi@@ st@@ le b@@ lowing website , Wiki@@ le@@ aks , is increasingly under fire in the United States .
Internet activists have lost access to their American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe .
The prominent American Sen@@ ator Jo@@ e Lie@@ ber@@ man called upon other countries and companies to boy@@ cot@@ t Wiki@@ le@@ aks .
In the meantime , a newspaper report suggests Wiki@@ le@@ aks founder Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange , who is on Inter@@ pol &apos;s wanted list , is currently in Great Britain .
&quot; Wiki@@ le@@ aks forced off Ama@@ zon servers . &quot;
&quot; Free speech in the land of the free , &quot; said the whi@@ st@@ le b@@ lowing activists on Wednesday ( local time ) via the Twitter mess@@ aging service .
A short while previously , the internet company Ama@@ zon had banned Wiki@@ le@@ aks documents from its servers .
The internet activists had used the Ama@@ zon Web Service ( A@@ WS ) to publish secret diplomatic dispat@@ ches in order to be able to cope with the high number of people accessing the documents .
Wiki@@ le@@ aks discussed the step on Twitter : &quot; Great - we &apos;ll spend our dollars emplo@@ ying people in Europe instead . &quot;
If Ama@@ zon had issues with freedom of speech , &quot; it should give up selling books . &quot;
Ama@@ zon stopped Wiki@@ le@@ aks using its servers after colleagues of Sen@@ ator Jo@@ e Lie@@ ber@@ man started to investigate , reported the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N , quot@@ ing Lie@@ ber@@ man &apos;s office .
The chairman of the Sen@@ ate Committee on Hom@@ eland Security and Govern@@ mental Affairs had threatened to boy@@ cot@@ t Ama@@ zon , reported the British newspaper &quot; The Gu@@ ardi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; I would have liked to see Ama@@ zon take this step earlier , considering the previous publication of classified information by Wiki@@ le@@ aks , &quot; said the Sen@@ ator .
Lie@@ ber@@ man also called on other countries to cooperate in preventing Wiki@@ le@@ aks from finding new servers .
&quot; Wiki@@ le@@ aks &quot; illegal , ou@@ trage@@ ous , and reck@@ less acts have com@@ promised our national security and put lives at risk around the world , &quot; the non-@@ party Sen@@ ator stated in a statement .
&quot; No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should assist Wiki@@ le@@ aks in its efforts to dis@@ semin@@ ate these st@@ olen materials . &quot;
Wiki@@ le@@ aks founder Ass@@ ange , who is wanted by Swedish authority on sus@@ pic@@ ion of rap@@ e , is on Inter@@ pol &apos;s wanted list .
According to a report in the Lond@@ on-@@ based newspaper &quot; The Independent , &quot; the 3@@ 9-@@ year-old Australian is currently in the UK , and Scotland Y@@ ard is aware of his exact location .
The internet activ@@ ist has always described the Swedish investigations as a scheme or@@ chest@@ rated by his det@@ rac@@ tors .
In London , Wiki@@ le@@ aks spo@@ kes@@ man Kri@@ st@@ inn H@@ ra@@ f@@ n@@ sson said that threats had been made .
&quot; There have even been calls to assass@@ in@@ ate Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange . &quot;
H@@ ra@@ f@@ n@@ sson said that Ass@@ ange was therefore afraid for his personal safety .
The Wiki@@ le@@ aks founder will remain in hi@@ ding .
H@@ ra@@ f@@ n@@ sson was clearly re@@ acting to statements from North America .
In America , the former Republic@@ an Govern@@ or of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee , had called for the people responsible for the Wiki@@ le@@ aks re@@ vel@@ ations to be indic@@ ted and executed for treas@@ on .
In Canada , one of Prime Minister Stephen Har@@ per &apos;s advis@@ ers ir@@ on@@ ically suggested on television that Ass@@ ange should be &quot; killed &quot; and that Obama could &quot; use a dr@@ one . &quot;
In the meantime , exchanges have been made between the White House and Ass@@ ange .
Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs , the speaker of American President Barack Obama , said that it was &quot; ridicul@@ ous and absurd &quot; that Ass@@ ange had demanded the resign@@ ation of Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton if she is found responsible for recently revealed requests to diplom@@ ats to engage in es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
&quot; I &apos;m not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website , &quot; said Gi@@ b@@ bs .
&quot; Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far stronger than his one website . &quot;
The American government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the security of its databases .
Rus@@ sell Tra@@ vers , Dep@@ uty Director of the Information Division at the National Anti-@@ Terror@@ ism Centre , has been appointed as a special representative , the White House announced .
Tra@@ vers will be responsible for developing the &quot; necessary structural reforms &quot; that are now needed following the disclos@@ ure of diplomatic dispat@@ ches by Wiki@@ le@@ aks .
The White House also wants to look at how the entire government exchanges and protects information .
The American government also expressed its concern for the safety of dis@@ si@@ dents and activists who may be put at risk by the Wiki@@ le@@ aks publication .
&quot; We have done everything to contact them , &quot; said States Department Spo@@ kes@@ man Phili@@ p Crow@@ ley .
&quot; We are ready to protect them if that becomes necessary . &quot;
The I@@ ce Cre@@ am University
I@@ ce cream conf@@ ection@@ ers are being trained for the warm seasons at the &quot; Gel@@ ato University &quot; in Bologna .
The three-@@ day foundation course for future &quot; gel@@ ati@@ eri &quot; is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the world .
Where does all that ice cream actually come from ?
From the &quot; gel@@ ati@@ ere &quot; and the &quot; gel@@ at@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
The &quot; gel@@ ati@@ ere , &quot; known in English as the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned &quot; ice cream conf@@ ection@@ er , &quot; produces the cream following the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making .
The &quot; gel@@ at@@ ai@@ o &quot; gets the ice cream out of the refriger@@ ated counter with a sp@@ at@@ ula , smooth@@ es it into w@@ af@@ ers and s@@ ells it .
You do not need to go to An@@ z@@ ola dell &apos;@@ Em@@ ili@@ a in the province of Bologna to know that .
But for anyone who wants to know more about ice cream , the &quot; Gel@@ ato University &quot; of the Italian Car@@ pi@@ gi@@ ani company is a must .
The ice cream university was created by the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from all its makers met exac@@ ting Italian standards .
The three-@@ day foundation course for future &quot; gel@@ ati@@ eri &quot; is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the world .
There are also specialised courses over several days covering chocolate ice cream , and intern@@ ships in the company &apos;s own ice cream par@@ lo@@ ur .
Many dream of a new career to escape a mid-@@ life crisis ; others come to test their vague aspirations against the cold facts .
This time , there are 40 participants from 19 countries and every continent - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia .
Jack@@ y , an art teacher from California , lo@@ ves the slow food movement and wants to offer a high-quality European product in a country accu@@ stom@@ ed to industrial ice cream .
An@@ ke from Berlin is a management consult@@ ant and wants to do something on her own after years in a highly stres@@ s@@ ful job .
Two young Egyptian girls dream of opening an ice cream par@@ lo@@ ur in Cairo .
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian hou@@ se@@ wife Juli@@ a has come because her children love Italian ice cream .
Ma@@ estro gel@@ ati@@ ere Lu@@ ciano Ferrari begins the course by descri@@ bing the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream .
Not only a good flav@@ our , but sil@@ ky sof@@ tness and good tex@@ ture are key .
Training the course , Lu@@ ciano does not forget to mention the real ic@@ ing on the c@@ ake for the national and thoroughly southern mon@@ oli@@ th . &quot; Italian gel@@ ato is simply the best - after that , it &apos;s all just rom@@ ance . &quot;
The first step of production seems very easy .
Lu@@ ciano po@@ urs the basic ingredients - milk , cream , pow@@ dered milk , sugar and stabili@@ sers - into a large bl@@ ender that he@@ ats the mixture to 85 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately co@@ ols it to four degrees .
Then he turns a t@@ ap on the machine and out comes a past@@ eur@@ ised , basic white ice cream , the basic for all mil@@ k-@@ based ice cre@@ ams .
The lec@@ tur@@ er is immediately overwhel@@ med by questions . Can you make ice cream using natural ingredients only without stabili@@ sers ?
How can you experiment freely on your own ?
Lu@@ ciano war@@ ns against letting the spirit of the age lead you ast@@ ray .
Anyone who talks about making ice cream &quot; using natural ingredients only &quot; has probably used stabili@@ sers anyway - in most cases a natural product such as gu@@ ar g@@ um from gu@@ ar be@@ ans .
Of course , you can make ice cream without stabili@@ sers , but then you have to sell it within a day , as otherwise it collap@@ ses and your customer ends up li@@ cking l@@ umps of ice .
Some variations to the base are allowed .
It gets more exciting with the flav@@ ours .
For ice cream flav@@ our@@ ing , Ma@@ estro Lu@@ ciano differenti@@ ates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section and in the sweet section of the super@@ market .
There are also pow@@ ders and past@@ es .
&quot; All suppliers will try to get you to get you to buy doz@@ ens of flav@@ oured additives .
But you should just experiment . &quot;
Ei@@ ther with fruit sor@@ bets using sugar and fresh fruits ,
or with a white ice cream base that can be turned into yellow cream by using eggs or can be mixed with co@@ coa powder to form the base of all kinds of se@@ duc@@ tive chocolate .
At last the course participants are allowed onto the ice cream maker .
Lu@@ ciano lets each of them make four different types of van@@ illa , chocolate , mo@@ cha and ha@@ zel@@ n@@ ut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base and with more or less van@@ illa flav@@ our@@ ing or other natural ingredients .
The experiment is repeated with the range of fruit sor@@ bets .
More flav@@ our@@ ings , more fruit pur@@ ée - not necessarily an improvement in taste .
H@@ az@@ el@@ n@@ ut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nut@@ ty when it contains more ha@@ zel@@ nu@@ ts .
The team that produces the most popular ki@@ wi ice cream uses more fruit , less water and a little less of the stabili@@ ser .
The taste of a gel@@ ato only really stands out if the mixture is balanced , says Lu@@ ciano .
Making ice cream is a matter of ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic . If sug@@ ary pe@@ ach pur@@ ée is used , the proportion of sugar in the basic recip@@ e has to be reduced .
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lem@@ on ice cream .
Lu@@ ciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of fruit ( vin@@ tn@@ ers use it to measure the density of gra@@ pe must using the O@@ ech@@ s@@ le scale ) .
Fortunately , tables make the calculations easier .
Making ice cream does not require as much physical activity as it once did .
It is not just the machine , which produces the base .
There is also a device that be@@ ats the finished ice cream mixture to a cre@@ am@@ y consistency while cooling it to negative temperatures .
But despite all automation , minor accidents still occur .
The Brazilian Gu@@ stav@@ o covers himself and his course m@@ ates from head to to@@ e with fruit pur@@ ée as he loses control of the over@@ sized hand-@@ held bl@@ ender .
&quot; In every course , &quot; says Ma@@ estro Lu@@ ciano , &quot; it is only a matter of time before something like this happens . &quot;
In@@ spec@@ tors in the twi@@ light
There are alleg@@ ations that the European Food Safety Authority ( EF@@ SA ) has been in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by the genetically modified crop industry .
The Test@@ bi@@ ot@@ ech centre of expertise , which sees itself as an independent institute for assessing the impact of biotechnology , has made the accus@@ ation .
&quot; It sounds like a con@@ spi@@ racy theory , but we have good documentary evidence , &quot; said head of Test@@ bi@@ ot@@ ech , Christoph Then , in Munich on Wednesday .
Harry Ku@@ i@@ per , chair of EF@@ SA &apos;s expert panel responsible for the risk assessment of genetically engine@@ ered plants and another EF@@ SA expert are also believed to have been working with the lobby group IL@@ SI for years .
IL@@ SI receives funds from corporations such as Mon@@ san@@ to , N@@ est@@ le and Bay@@ er .
Ku@@ i@@ per has had a central role in developing the EF@@ SA test specifications for GM plants and therefore has a clear conflict of interests , says Then .
In places , the EF@@ SA regulations are identical to position papers produced by IL@@ SI and thus are being written by the very industry that the authority , based in the Italian city of Par@@ ma , should be controlling , argu@@ es Then ,
pointing out that this is the second time Test@@ bi@@ ot@@ ech has criticised a conflict of interests .
A high-@@ ranking EF@@ SA manager recently moved to the Swiss agri@@ business company Syn@@ gent@@ a without any restrictions or a transitional period being imposed , and is now on the other side of the line .
M@@ DR Radio has also recently un@@ covered personal connections between the EU supervisory authority and the industry lobby , which has caught the attention of the Environment Agency and EU parliament@@ arians .
However , EF@@ SA does not see any conflict of interests .
In a statement , EF@@ SA said that all significant data were considered , including data from industry , if such data were of a high professional quality .
In addition , EF@@ SA stated that it had no requirement that its panels avoid all contact with industry .
However , all members of EF@@ SA must disc@@ lose any such contact .
Ku@@ i@@ per ad@@ mits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute ( IL@@ SI ) in the USA .
The institute describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science , industry and politics to assess the risks around biotechnology and other areas - without a lob@@ b@@ ying mandate .
In this field , independent experts such as Then express criticism that genetically modified plants are currently approved for animals without feeding trials and that the reaction of GM plants to environmental influences is not being investigated .
&quot; For example , we want to know what genetically modified cor@@ n does in fields , &quot; says Then .
Cur@@ rent practice is only to test isolated prot@@ eins , but not the entire GM plant , which does not provide reliable results .
&quot; If you don &apos;t look for the risks , how are you supposed to find them ? , &quot; asks Then .
Angel@@ ika Hil@@ beck shares his opinion .
The scienti@@ st has been carrying out research into GM technology since 1994 and is currently working at ET@@ H Zurich .
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or dis@@ credit outs@@ po@@ ken@@ ly critical scientists in this field in Europe , as in the USA , says Hil@@ beck .
There are hardly any researchers left without ties to corporations , she believes ,
and studies critic@@ ising companies are not normally published .
&quot; The industry is controlling safety research , &quot; says Hil@@ beck .
The trail of stones
U@@ li G@@ sell has got hold of some - in total , around 400 ki@@ los .
On Monday evening , he was standing in front of Stuttgart train station , his tu@@ ba on his back .
There was a demonstration .
It was snow@@ ing .
The t@@ ale is a familiar one . In September , the excav@@ ators arrived and had begun to break up a large section of the north wing .
Stuttgart was not the same . Th@@ ous@@ ands and thousands of people demonstrated against S@@ 21 , the multi-@@ billion Euro sin@@ king of the train station .
By the time work was suspended , a large proportion of the wing was rub@@ ble .
Bro@@ ken into 6@@ 000 or 7@@ 000 pieces .
C@@ rail@@ sh@@ eim shell lim@@ estone , a cru@@ mb@@ ly co@@ ar@@ se stone , qu@@ arri@@ ed between 19@@ 14 and 1920 .
4@@ 3-@@ year-old G@@ sell is a sculp@@ tor in Ost@@ fil@@ dern .
He got hold of a few ch@@ un@@ ks .
&quot; These stones are rel@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; They will not disappear . &quot;
He ra@@ ves : &quot; A cheap and poor stone , simple and ear@@ thy . &quot;
When he cut one out , it sm@@ elt of cigar@@ ette f@@ umes .
He still does not know what he will do with the ch@@ un@@ ks of stone .
St@@ ones have plenty of time .
As does U@@ li G@@ sell .
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in T@@ ü@@ bin@@ gen and a former French m@@ uni@@ tions de@@ pot where Manuel Ron@@ gen has created his own world of stone .
The 4@@ 4-@@ year-old tra@@ des in old stones .
He has bought every stone from the demo@@ li@@ tion in Stuttgart .
&quot; It would be a crime if they were ground into gra@@ vel or disappeared into land@@ fill , &quot; he says in his office , a small wooden sh@@ ack that was once a s@@ entry box .
People ins@@ ul@@ ted and threatened him , he rec@@ alls , when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demo@@ li@@ tion contrac@@ tor .
He talked with the opponents of the Stuttgart 21 development project for days on end .
He explained that there was nothing he could do about the demo@@ li@@ tion .
And if it were going to happen , then the most sensible thing was that the stones were used again for other purposes .
In response , around 200 Stuttgart 21 opponents took a block away with them , each weigh@@ ing an average of 80 ki@@ los and co@@ sting 6.@@ 50 to 14 Euros .
Some as a ke@@ ep@@ sake , but others in the hope of being able to return the blocks if the building is re@@ built .
Ron@@ gen had bought 500 tonnes - equivalent to 25 tru@@ ck-@@ loads .
About half is stored in the forest , but the rest has been sold long ago .
Gar@@ den@@ ers , landscape gar@@ den@@ ers and home@@ owners .
They came from everywhere and took away whatever they could carry in car bo@@ ots and tra@@ ilers .
The Stuttgart stones of scandal have long since been transformed into walls , or boundaries for her@@ b gardens .
&quot; Ac@@ tually , this stone is nothing special , &quot; says Ron@@ gen .
&quot; If it didn &apos;t have political significance . &quot;
He clim@@ bs into his off-@@ ro@@ ader and does a tour of his realm of 20 hectares .
He studied law but swit@@ ched to bi@@ ology , then he got interested in computers , and finally became a stone mer@@ ch@@ ant .
And a stone enthusi@@ ast .
He stores 40@@ ,000 tonnes of stone .
He car@@ ts his treas@@ ure from all over Germany .
And claims to be the largest used stone dealer in the country .
He bra@@ kes .
Art@@ fully car@@ ved sand@@ stones are lying in the snow .
&quot; They used to be part of Dresden &apos;s Mari@@ en@@ brücke , &quot; he says .
El@@ be sand@@ stone , yellow and warm , he says .
&quot; My favourite stone . &quot;
The route then continues up@@ wards through the forest .
He points to a pi@@ le : red sand@@ stone , previously part of Karlsruhe train station .
And more .
&quot; Beautiful tra@@ vert@@ ine . &quot;
The blocks once belong@@ ed to the stands of Stuttgart &apos;s N@@ eck@@ ar stadium .
The snow is full of stones and stories - Stuttgart tra@@ vert@@ ine from Stuttgart police headquarters , red gran@@ ite from Dom St. Bla@@ si@@ us , tu@@ ff from Heil@@ brun@@ n hospital .
So much work , so much effort , so much swe@@ at .
When Ron@@ gen thinks about how the stones used to be car@@ ved by hand and moved with simply pul@@ leys and ox@@ car@@ ts , he feels a great sense of rever@@ ence .
&quot; It would be a scandal to sh@@ red all this . &quot;
He has@@ n &apos;t become rich , but he has found some pri@@ cel@@ ess stones .
The stone mer@@ ch@@ ant currently emplo@@ ys 14 people and mas@@ ons , sculp@@ tors , a s@@ mi@@ th , a glass b@@ lower and a hor@@ tic@@ ultur@@ ist have also set up in the forest .
&quot; We work hard , but it is satis@@ fying , &quot; says the used stone dealer .
He has to go to Cologne soon .
There are stones to be rescu@@ ed there as well .
Tal@@ ent war for gradu@@ ates with potential
There is a r@@ ush on at the buffet .
16 students are sho@@ ving their way to sal@@ mon roll@@ s , tom@@ ato sou@@ p and desert .
The Technical University of Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g and the car maker Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop .
They are going talk shop on the car of the future with V@@ W developers in a kind of idea contest - and , inci@@ dentally , find out more about Volkswagen .
Many companies are already engaged in hand@@ -to-@@ hand combat in the contest for the cle@@ ver@@ est minds , and are rel@@ ying on cooperation with universities , just like V@@ W .
Their mission : to recru@@ it the most tal@@ ented gradu@@ ates as early as possible in the lec@@ ture hall - before they come onto the job market and are cour@@ ted by anyone else .
And because universities do not provide a break@@ down of student performance , companies are looking for and hoping to attract exceptional talent in hand@@ s-@@ on projects .
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g , the car maker it out to wo@@ o the talent .
A young woman from human resources distri@@ butes ball@@ point p@@ ens , gum@@ my bears and fol@@ ders bearing the V@@ W logo .
She tells the young hop@@ eful@@ s about intern@@ ships and student jobs , and explains the various routes into the company .
N@@ ico S@@ elle from the Technical University of Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g is managing the project with V@@ W .
He sees advantages for both sides . &quot; The students get in contact with industry and gain some experience . &quot;
&quot; V@@ W can get to know students while taking a closer look at interesting candidates and thinking about which ones are their potential employees . &quot;
Such cooperation , thinks S@@ ells , is not unusual .
What is new is that students are being tou@@ ted so aggres@@ sively .
&quot; The focus used to be on speci@@ alis@@ m-@@ specific projects , &quot; says S@@ elle .
The fight for the latest bat@@ ch of gradu@@ ates is set to be a lot tou@@ gher .
In many sectors , companies can no longer identify their employees from the ho@@ ards of applicants .
They really have to sell themselves to win over highly qualified gradu@@ ates .
Gra@@ du@@ ates in engineering find themselves particularly well placed for negotiation .
According to the Association of German Engine@@ ers ( V@@ DI ) , more than 40@@ ,000 engineering jobs were un@@ filled in October .
And the shortage of engineers is going to get worse , according to V@@ DI .
Roman D@@ y@@ kt@@ a is on the h@@ unt for talent for K@@ PM@@ G , the audit , tax and advisory services firm .
He organis@@ es la@@ vis@@ h recruitment events such as the K@@ PM@@ G race , a kind of modern sc@@ av@@ enger h@@ unt where participants have to find their route using GPS coordin@@ ates .
The company wants to send eight promising students straight across the USA next year .
And quite inci@@ dentally , the participants will see K@@ PM@@ G branches and get to know the company .
Who gets to go is decided in two advance selection rounds .
Only the cr@@ ème de la cr@@ ème of the many applicants will fly to the USA .
A@@ midst all the war cri@@ es surrounding university gradu@@ ates with potential , the rif@@ le shots from some companies are getting lou@@ der and lou@@ der , says D@@ y@@ kt@@ a .
&quot; With this race , we want to stand out from the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Just one trip wasn &apos;t enough for us . &quot;
For tal@@ ent-@@ h@@ unter D@@ y@@ kt@@ a , the sums add up .
&quot; To this day , we have stayed in contact with all the participants of a similar campaign last year . &quot;
&quot; Some of them are just about to graduate and expect to apply to us soon , &quot; he says .
Besides direct tou@@ ting on camp@@ us , small and medium-sized businesses especially are stal@@ king candidates at classic career fairs .
&quot; We try to reach gradu@@ ates at fairs . &quot;
&quot; For example , at Inter@@ solar , &quot; says Si@@ th@@ a St@@ ü@@ be , head of human resources at the solar technology manufacturer , Solar@@ world .
The B@@ onn@@ -based company emplo@@ ys around 1500 people in Germany .
St@@ ü@@ be is well aware of the problem of attrac@@ ting young talent .
There are currently 35 vac@@ ancies on the company website .
&quot; It is really very difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions . &quot;
&quot; It costs a lot of time and money , &quot; she says .
Another route is contact via university lec@@ tur@@ ers .
Solar@@ world is co@@ operating with a number of universities , including Frei@@ berg University .
&quot; The lec@@ tur@@ ers point out that the students can do intern@@ ships or write their dis@@ ser@@ tations with us . &quot;
Ex@@ pen@@ sive advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not in the pipeline .
On the other hand , the company is trying to adverti@@ se with its other advantages , including a relaxed working atmosphere , flat hierarch@@ ies and straightforward communication .
&quot; A big cor@@ poration cannot often offer that , &quot; says human resources manager St@@ ü@@ be .
Money has not been the key factor in the job market for a while .
Flexi@@ ble working time , child@@ care and good promotion opportunities are also decisive factors .
Solar@@ world came in 5@@ 5th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute .
The institute publish@@ es an annual leag@@ ue table of German employers .
It asks employees how happy they are with their work and job environment and looks at the general working conditions .
Human resources manager St@@ ü@@ be hopes to score points with j@@ ob@@ -@@ seekers thanks to the company &apos;s place on the list .
&quot; I think that applicants are influenced strongly by external assessments of any potential employ@@ er , &quot; she says .
Wolf R@@ einer Krieg@@ ler from the German Emp@@ lo@@ yer Br@@ anding Academy is an advis@@ or for companies seeking to develop a reputation as a good employ@@ er as part of a long-term strategy .
He advis@@ es his clients to be more authentic .
And that actually means internal changes , says Krieg@@ ler .
&quot; The best way to make yourself attractive as an employ@@ er is via your own employees , &quot; he says .
In industry jar@@ gon , that means Emp@@ lo@@ yer Br@@ anding among your own employees .
&quot; Happ@@ y employees are the best amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
If you treat your own well and they identify with the company , then they will find you new employees among their friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances .
&quot; It &apos;s like playing in a band , &quot; says Krieg@@ ler .
Obama stops new oil dri@@ lling
There will be no new dri@@ lling off the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming year .
The government in Washington has published a prohi@@ bition to that effect - thereby defini@@ tively scra@@ pping earlier plans .
New dri@@ lling is also forbidden off the Atlantic coast for the immediate future .
Secretary of the Inter@@ ior K@@ en Sal@@ az@@ ar made the announcement on Wednesday .
The explosion of the De@@ ep@@ water Horiz@@ on dri@@ lling platform in April was the trigger for the strict prohi@@ bition , which is to remain in force for at least the next five years .
Before the disaster that cost el@@ even workers their lives and led to the USA &apos;s biggest environmental disaster , President Barack Obama , under pressure from the opposition and industry , had sign@@ alled his read@@ iness to allow new dri@@ lling in the eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ad@@ voc@@ ators had hoped this would reduce the USA &apos;s dependency on foreign oil supplies .
Who will bear responsibility for the devastating oil sp@@ ill in the Gulf has still not been conclu@@ sively decided .
The British energy company B@@ P is the focus of criticism , and is faced with claims for billions of dollars .
A board of inquiry set up by President Obama is set to submit its findings at some point in December .
In October , Secretary of the Inter@@ ior K@@ en Sal@@ az@@ ar had rev@@ oked the prohi@@ bition on dri@@ lling imposed after the explosion .
In response , various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new dri@@ lling projects .
Obama and Sal@@ az@@ ar want to rule out any further catastro@@ phe with tou@@ gher controls and stricter safety regulations .
The responsible control authority , which fell into dis@@ rep@@ ute after numerous accus@@ ations of corruption , is being exten@@ sively reformed .
At the same time , the President has announced that lu@@ cr@@ ative tax lo@@ op@@ holes for oil and gas companies will be stopped .
The industry is warning publicly that the output in the Gulf will be significantly lower than in the past if regulation is tou@@ gher .
&quot; The government &apos;s plans are the biggest bra@@ ke on the growth of the oil and gas industry , &quot; is the outcome of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm B@@ DO - even before the prohi@@ bition on dri@@ lling was put in place on Wednesday .
The American Energy Alliance also compl@@ ains of the uncertainty faced by the industry . &quot; No one knows what exactly will change in terms of regulation . &quot;
The organisation believes investment in new projects will be suspended in@@ definitely - at the expense of growth .
O@@ gon@@ il@@ and has bur@@ nt down
The water in the rivers is o@@ il-@@ brown and re@@ eks like a pet@@ rol station . Billi@@ ons of li@@ tres of le@@ aked cru@@ de oil have destroyed the natural environment of O@@ gon@@ il@@ and in Nigeria .
People are living on th@@ eft , corruption and cooking illegal oil .
Cel@@ est@@ ine Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i sees the positive side .
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , &quot; the eco@@ activ@@ ist tells journalists . &quot; You &apos;ll see plenty of oil s@@ lu@@ dge to phot@@ ograph today . &quot;
The 3@@ 7-@@ year-old Nig@@ eri@@ an was trying to phot@@ ograph a boy w@@ ading up to his wa@@ ist in the water - and the stre@@ aks of water around him . In the rain@@ b@@ ow-@@ coloured water , the scene is almost beautiful .
The brown bil@@ lows of cru@@ de oil under the surface are in@@ visible .
Es@@ ther Bad@@ om used to fill bu@@ ckets with sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s at the bank of the Bo@@ do jet@@ ty river .
Now , the stag@@ n@@ ant waters are completely dead .
Five years ago , massive quantities of cru@@ de oil floo@@ ded out of a bur@@ st oil pipeline into the vast w@@ et@@ land .
Fis@@ her@@ men from the nearby town of Bo@@ do now have to p@@ add@@ le six hours to get to water inhab@@ ited by fish . O@@ gon@@ il@@ and , in the heart of the N@@ iger del@@ ta , is one of the most contam@@ inated regions in the world .
On the journey through the man@@ gro@@ ve sw@@ amps , cris@@ s-@@ cross@@ ed by river courses , the full extent of the dev@@ ast@@ ation is plain to see .
Instead of clear water , the motor@@ boat chur@@ ns up a brown s@@ will ; if you put your hand in the water it comes out co@@ ated in oil .
The roots of the man@@ gro@@ ve trees stick out from the ground like black liqu@@ ori@@ ce sti@@ cks . The od@@ d pal@@ m among the man@@ gro@@ ves hang@@ s its fron@@ d des@@ p@@ ond@@ ently .
The flo@@ cks of birds u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in w@@ et@@ lands are no@@ where to be seen . As soon as the out@@ board motor falls silent , a devastating quiet desc@@ ends over the former paradise that now st@@ in@@ ks like a pet@@ rol station .
&quot; What is happening here is ecological war@@ fare , &quot; says Cel@@ est@@ ine Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i , som@@ br@@ ely . &quot; We are living with a permanent haz@@ ard to health . &quot;
The comparison to war is ap@@ posite .
The region of the O@@ g@@ oni has been a cont@@ ested batt@@ le@@ field for decades . More than 60 years ago , the first expl@@ or@@ ers from Europe made their way to the region . In the 8@@ 0s , the first wave of resistance was organised around the author K@@ en S@@ aro@@ -@@ Wi@@ wa , who was later executed . It was here that the S@@ hell company had to stop production in 1993 , because it was too dangerous for its oil workers .
Even today , the company is prohibited from returning to O@@ gon@@ il@@ and . While more than two million bar@@ rel@@ s of black gold are p@@ ump@@ ed every day from the del@@ ta region as a whole - which is an area three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5000 well@@ s and 7@@ 000 kilometres of pipeline - the o@@ il@@ fields in O@@ gon@@ il@@ and lie f@@ allow , the situation too unstable for the oil company .
Every few hundred metres , steel frames rise from the water like bizarre sculp@@ tures . The heads of bor@@ ehol@@ es are far too aff@@ ection@@ ately referred to as &quot; little Christmas trees . &quot;
These structures can be up to 50 years old and most of them are seriously cor@@ ro@@ ded .
One bor@@ eh@@ ole after the next falls apart , says Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i , then a constant stream of cru@@ de oil runs into the water .
According to expert estimates , more than two billion li@@ tres have f@@ lown into the del@@ ta &apos;s eco@@ system in 50 years . Year on year , that is the same amount of oil that rus@@ hed into the sea off Al@@ as@@ ka when the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez super@@ tan@@ ker cr@@ ashed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastro@@ ph@@ es in human history .
There is dispute over who should be held responsible for the ongoing worst case scenario of ecological disaster .
Whilst the S@@ hell company says sab@@ ot@@ age and organised th@@ eft of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of the contamination , environment@@ alists believe bur@@ st dri@@ ll heads and le@@ aking pi@@ pel@@ ines are the main cause .
In 2008 , the US academic Richard St@@ einer accused S@@ hell of applying significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world . The rate of defects in pi@@ pel@@ ines alone was &quot; several times higher than elsewhere . &quot;
Human figures emerge from the man@@ gro@@ ve sw@@ amps , that from a distance look deser@@ ted , o@@ il-@@ covered outside gar@@ ages . The figures are stark n@@ aked and covered to the neck in oil .
Under one of the many bar@@ rel@@ s - some connected to pi@@ pes , others sc@@ attered at random over the ground - there is a a fli@@ ck@@ ering fire . An illegal mini re@@ fin@@ ery .
Michael , the group leader , explains that the cru@@ de oil is heated in the bar@@ rel for several hours .
First , ben@@ z@@ ine is si@@ ph@@ oned off to a collecting p@@ an , then ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e dri@@ ps from the end of the tube and finally , diesel .
Michael and four assist@@ ants produce up to four 300@@ -@@ li@@ tre bar@@ rel@@ s of diesel a day in this way . &quot; We get 34@@ ,000 n@@ air@@ a for it &quot; - about 22 dollars .
The inhabitants of the del@@ ta use the chronic fuel shortage to their advantage in the largest cru@@ de oil state of sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ aran Africa .
Nigeria has just one re@@ fin@@ ery of its own .
The illegal coo@@ ks can still under@@ cut the absur@@ dly low diesel prices of 40 Euro c@@ ents per li@@ tre . They get their raw material for nothing .
The material comes from &quot; b@@ unk@@ er@@ ers &quot; who t@@ ap the pipeline network all the way across O@@ gon@@ il@@ and . Over the entire N@@ iger del@@ ta , experts estimate the country loses at least 16 millions li@@ tres of cru@@ de oil a day in this way .
However , only a tiny proportion of the raw material stored by b@@ unk@@ er@@ ers goes on to be refined illegally . Organis@@ ed criminal networks with politicians and high-@@ ranking officers amongst their ranks fill t@@ ank@@ ers with the lion &apos;s share and flo@@ g it on the global market .
The activ@@ ist Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i believes the debate around whether the environmental catastro@@ phe is the result of the activities of the population or la@@ x production safety standards is purely academic .
&quot; If the oil companies were not perceived as inter@@ l@@ op@@ ers and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen &apos;s livel@@ ihood , there would not be any sab@@ ot@@ age , th@@ eft or illegal re@@ fin@@ eries . &quot;
Ak@@ po@@ bar@@ i explains that the relationship between the O@@ g@@ oni towards S@@ hell in particular has been destroyed to such an extent that only withdrawal by the company is an option . &quot; Perhaps other nations such as the Chinese will prove to be a better option . &quot;
Michael turns ed@@ gy .
&quot; It &apos;s time you disappear , &quot; says the mus@@ cular oil man .
&quot; The soldiers might turn up at any minute . &quot;
If the illegal oil re@@ fin@@ ers are caught by the army &apos;s task force , they are not likely to be j@@ ailed , but will have to pay hef@@ ty bri@@ bes .
It seems that the soldiers , who mainly origin@@ ate from the north of the country , also want to profit from oil , like all other Nig@@ eri@@ ans .

Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ators un@@ cover dangerous defect in A3@@ 80 engines
The A3@@ 80 , it seems , has a major safety issue .
During examination of a plane following an emergency landing , investig@@ ators have discovered a possible defect that could cause &quot; catastro@@ phi@@ c engine failure . &quot;
The airline Q@@ ant@@ as is now preparing to take the engine manufacturer to court .
The passengers of the Q@@ ant@@ as Airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of November appear to have had considerably more luck than anyone realised . During its investigations , the Australian air safety authority identified a serious safety issue in the engines of some A3@@ 80 planes - and is now warning of a possible construction defect .
The alleged defect would have serious consequences . In a statement published on Thursday , the Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( AT@@ S@@ B ) revealed that the defect could potentially cause f@@ ati@@ gue cra@@ cks and le@@ aks in an oil ho@@ se connection .
This could lead to &quot; catastro@@ phi@@ c engine failure . &quot;
20 different A3@@ 80 aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es with Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce engines may be affected .
The Q@@ ant@@ as Airbus that was forced to land in Singapore on 4 November was one of those aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es .
The Australian airline is now taking legal steps against the British tur@@ b@@ ine manufacturer .
It has submitted a claim to an Australian federal court in Sydney which leaves open further potential legal measures against the company .
The CEO of Q@@ ant@@ as , Alan Jo@@ y@@ ce , said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident which occurred at the beginning of November .
The heat of the engine had caused parts to become det@@ ached and had damaged the w@@ ings .
Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce believes an oil fire caused the damage .
Following the incident , up to 40 engines around the world must now be replaced .
The Australian investig@@ ators announced that they will be carrying out further safety tests on the super@@ j@@ um@@ bo@@ s fitted with the affected engines .
AT@@ S@@ B speaker Martin Dol@@ an said that the safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce .
The safety issue was considered sufficiently serious for all affected parties to be informed .
After the forced landing of the Q@@ ant@@ as plane , the airline ground@@ ed its A3@@ 80 fleet for weeks .
Singapore Airlines temporarily kept about three of its el@@ even A3@@ 80 on the ground .
Lufthansa replaced the engine in one A3@@ 80 as a precau@@ tion .
The double-@@ deck@@ er is the largest passenger plane in the world .
Coun@@ tr@@ y-@@ wide snow@@ fall un@@ le@@ ash@@ es traffic chaos
Germany all in white . There has been overnight snow@@ fall across most of the country .
There is chaos on many roads , and trains and flights have been cancelled .
At least three people have died in car accidents .

Deutsche Bank seeking buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to sell its emb@@ lem . According to a newspaper report , the bank is looking for bu@@ yers for the two office high-@@ rises at its Frankfurt headquarters .
The property could f@@ etch up to 500 million Euros .
Deutsche Bank only recently renovated its company headquarters . The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking quarter have been modernis@@ ed as ban@@ kers returned to their former workplace .
But the financial institution now clearly wants to rec@@ ou@@ p the costs of renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-@@ rises , writes Financial Times Germany , quot@@ ing a spo@@ kes@@ man .
The spo@@ kes@@ man did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale .
&quot; We are constantly re@@ viewing whether it is better to own property ourselves or to sell it and then rent it back , &quot; he said .
Germany &apos;s largest financial institution is aband@@ oning its company headquarters after only a limited period of time .
The bank first took over the two towers for 27@@ 2 million Euros in mid-@@ 2007 from the investors of one of its own funds and went on to implement an extensive programme of renovation .
According to the information available , the extensive renovation cost around 200 million Euros .
A sale would earn the bank a lot of money .
According to the newspaper , industry experts estimate the value of the towers , ren@@ amed the &quot; Gre@@ ent@@ o@@ wers , &quot; at around 500 million Euros .
Whether the buildings will be res@@ old to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently not decided , said the spo@@ kes@@ man .
Th@@ ous@@ ands mo@@ ur@@ n lost friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have attended a mem@@ orial service for the min@@ ers declared dead after a series of explo@@ sions .
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies , as the safety situation in the sha@@ ft where the accident happened remains prec@@ arious .
Almost two weeks ago , a violent explosion occurred in the Pi@@ ke River M@@ ine near the city of Gre@@ ym@@ outh .
29 min@@ ers aged between 17 and 62 were bur@@ ied alive below ground .
A probe was lower@@ ed into the sha@@ ft , but no signs of the survi@@ vors were discovered .
O@@ wing to the high concentration of po@@ ison@@ ous gases and further subsequent explo@@ sions , no rescu@@ ers were allowed into the sha@@ ft for safety reasons .
After the second violent det@@ on@@ ation , the authorities and experts acted on the assumption that there was no chance any of the min@@ ers had survi@@ ved .
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies .
Family members and friends remembered the dead in a mem@@ orial service .
In bright sunshine , ten thousand people gathered in Gre@@ ym@@ outh on New Zealand &apos;s South Island .
They held a two-@@ minute silence .
29 tables were set up in honour of the bur@@ ied min@@ ers , disp@@ laying hel@@ m@@ ets , lamps and their names .
Pic@@ tures and personal items , including clothing and sur@@ f@@ boards , were also on display .
The flags were flying at half m@@ ast at all government buildings in the country .
New Zealand had hoped that the min@@ ers would come back &quot; from the dep@@ ths of the earth &quot; to the surface , said the Prime Minister of New Ze@@ eland John Key to the crow@@ ds at the mem@@ orial .
&quot; But they never came home . &quot;
La@@ w@@ ri@@ e Dre@@ w , father of tra@@ pped coal min@@ er Z@@ en Dre@@ w , said that he could not come to terms with the death of his son until he had seen his body .
Several foreign diplom@@ ats took part in the mem@@ orial service alongside the Prime Minister and members of victims &quot; families .
British and South African min@@ ers were also bur@@ ied alive in the first explosion on 19 November .
Res@@ cu@@ ers began by ext@@ ingu@@ ishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand &apos;s South Island .
Super@@ int@@ endent G@@ ary Know@@ les told journalists that work would begin to cool the f@@ ier@@ ce temperatures inside the mine as soon as the explo@@ sive gases had been displaced .
To hell , war@@ ri@@ ors !
Is there a place for g@@ ore in art house cinema ?
The film director Nicolas Win@@ ding Ref@@ n is testing old gen@@ re boundaries af@@ res@@ h with his war@@ ri@@ or ep@@ ic &quot; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising . &quot;
What audience was the Danish director Nicolas Win@@ ding Ref@@ n thinking of when he was shooting &quot; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising &quot; ?
A captured Vi@@ king war@@ ri@@ or with only one eye ( Mad@@ s Mi@@ k@@ kel@@ sen ) escap@@ es his tor@@ ment@@ ors and kno@@ cks down his opponents with almost super@@ human powers - which sounds ideal for young male vie@@ wers on the search for g@@ ore and action , particularly as our her@@ o has a preference for brutal killing methods and is not a@@ verse to t@@ ear@@ ing out the ent@@ ra@@ ils from the living bodies of his enemies when he is in a bad mood .
On the other hand , O@@ ne-@@ E@@ ye , as he is actually called , does not say a word during the entire film , and even the other figures are only in@@ duced to say one or two sentences at most , or to em@@ it a few exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating death cri@@ es .
Otherwise , the film is silent , luxuri@@ ating in the e@@ eri@@ ly beautiful hills of Scotland that provides the scenery for the Vi@@ king world of around a thousand years ago .
More suited to adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in exist@@ enti@@ alism and very smooth tracking shots .
Great when a film has several target groups , but a shame if they are mutually exclusive .
Since his wild and sty@@ li@@ sed drug dealer tri@@ log@@ y &quot; P@@ us@@ her , &quot; Director Win@@ ding Ref@@ n has been seen as a kind of Danish version of Qu@@ entin Tar@@ ant@@ ino , but sto@@ ically ref@@ uses to make his works accessible to the mainstre@@ am by using a little more hum@@ our or to the art house by disp@@ laying less brut@@ ality .
Most art cinema enthusiasts would be det@@ er@@ red by the cer@@ eb@@ ral matter and ent@@ ra@@ ils flying around .
If they have not already done so , action fans will die of bor@@ ed@@ om when O@@ ne-@@ E@@ ye - for somewhat in@@ de@@ cip@@ her@@ able reasons - sets off by ship to Jerusalem with a tro@@ op of violent Christian mis@@ sion@@ aries , ending up stuck for what seems like an et@@ ernity in dead cal@@ ms and fo@@ g before the crew arri@@ ves in what is clearly America - where the silence continues .
No wonder then that &apos; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising &quot; has not found a cinema distribut@@ or in Germany and has only appeared on DVD .
This is a shame , particularly because the cin@@ em@@ at@@ ography is superb , but also because at times there is a stir@@ ring work of cinema behind the pre@@ ten@@ tious , at times bloo@@ dy fa@@ ç@@ ade - and that work of cinema deserves some attention .
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot , but all about atmosphere - a fe@@ ver@@ ish dream that has become a film .
For the viewer , there is no escape from that dream .
Ref@@ n hardly allows the viewer a single moment of relaxation and slowly ch@@ ok@@ es the same view with his iron images and the glo@@ om@@ y tran@@ ce-@@ like sound@@ track - and the in@@ comprehensible hat@@ red that strikes out at the viewer from the hearts of the characters .
Only one small bl@@ ond boy who stands fai@@ th@@ fully at O@@ ne-@@ E@@ ye &apos;s side re@@ tains anything of inno@@ c@@ ence - all other characters are driven by fur@@ y .
Above all , it is the one-@@ ey@@ ed her@@ o who is driven by fur@@ y - whose mo@@ tives are never explained , but who at some point becomes the war@@ ri@@ or from hell for his enemies and temporary allies alike , and perhaps even the mess@@ enger of the devi@@ l himself .
He equ@@ als dam@@ nation , but perhaps only for the already dam@@ ned .
&quot; Wal@@ h@@ alla R@@ ising &quot; is an en@@ ig@@ m@@ atic film that people will h@@ ate and admire , to their ch@@ agr@@ in , v@@ ex@@ ation and amaz@@ ement .
An experience .
M@@ yst@@ eri@@ ous earth@@ works
The International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency ( IA@@ EA ) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria .
The country is ref@@ using to comment - but is allowing inspections .
T@@ ow@@ ards mid@@ night on the night of 5th to 6th September 2007 , at least four Israeli F-@@ 15 I figh@@ ter j@@ ets attacked a mysteri@@ ous , cu@@ be@@ -@@ shaped building in Syria .
It stands on the banks of the E@@ up@@ hr@@ ates river ; the next major city , 30 kilometres away , is D@@ air Alz@@ our .
The name turns up in IA@@ EA documents when there is mention of the re@@ actor Syria is alleged to have built in the cu@@ be@@ -@@ shaped building hidden in a valley cut off from the country &apos;s electricity network - with aid from North Korea .
According to a brief@@ ing from the US foreign intelligence service , the CIA , at the end of April 2008 , the re@@ actor , commonly referred to by the name of the nearest settlement El Ki@@ bar , could be used to produce pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um - which could in turn be used to build atom@@ ic bom@@ bs .
The technology from the fif@@ ties is of very little use for any other purpose .
The CIA gave a video presentation with bl@@ ur@@ ry satellite images .
Using computer animation , the agency showed where the components of the re@@ actor are believed to have been located before its destruction - the re@@ actor is said to be a smaller copy of the north Korean model from the atom@@ ic centre in Y@@ ong@@ by@@ on .
They agency also produced photos showing the building close up , and even its interior .
The re@@ actor is believed to have been almost ready for commission@@ ing , but not yet supplied with fuel ro@@ ds .
Now , more than three years after the bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment , almost no more is known . In fact , the questions seem to have increased with time .
The former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his mem@@ o@@ irs that , although the CIA had known before the attack that Syria was building a re@@ actor in El Ki@@ bar , it had not discovered any signs that there was &quot; an active nuclear weapons programme &quot; in the country .
Many intelligence officials in Europe are even more scep@@ tical and speak only of an &quot; alleged re@@ actor , &quot; even if they believe the CIA presentation was &quot; pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
They lack hard evidence , as does the IA@@ EA .
A@@ sk@@ ed how certain he is that a re@@ actor exists this summer , a high-@@ ranking UN diplom@@ at rep@@ lied lac@@ on@@ ically that the IA@@ EA had &quot; enough material to pose questions . &quot;
The Syri@@ ans , in any case , rapidly removed the rub@@ ble of the supposedly &quot; un@@ used military building &quot; and lev@@ elled the area completely .
Nonetheless , in June 2008 , an IA@@ EA team led by chief inspec@@ tor Ol@@ li Hein@@ onen discovered traces of man@@ -@@ made ur@@ anium in El Ki@@ bar .
In addition , the IA@@ EA obtained commer@@ cially produced satellite images from a Member State from the period immediately preced@@ ing the attack - images said to be more convincing that the images presented by the CIA .
However , the images were not available on the market , as the unknown customer - Israel , perhaps - has purchased them exclusively .
Hence , the IA@@ EA cannot independently verify their authentic@@ ity .
Syria has claimed never to have had a secret atom@@ ic programme or to have built a re@@ actor .
Dam@@ as@@ cus claims the ur@@ anium was from Israeli weapons .
However , after analy@@ sing the partic@@ les , the IA@@ EA rejected the claim as impl@@ au@@ sible .
Since then , Dam@@ as@@ cus has avoided discussion on this point - or on the satellite images .
Syria has also prevented inspec@@ tors carrying out a second inspection in El Ki@@ bar or to access the rub@@ ble of the bom@@ bed building .
Israel is also maintaining a st@@ ony silence .
&quot; We will never comment on this , &quot; said the former Prime Minister E@@ hu@@ d Ol@@ m@@ ert , in office at the time of the attack , confir@@ ming the official position .
So the investigation has continued since June 2008 without conclusion and &quot; is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority , &quot; according to a high-@@ ranking western diplom@@ at at the IA@@ EA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately , a serious infringement of the non-@@ proliferation treaty remains un@@ resolved in the hands of the IA@@ EA .
The IA@@ EA clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three additional facilities that are supposed to have had a &quot; functional connection &quot; with the alleged re@@ actor - and in contrast to the re@@ actor , still exist .
However , inspec@@ tors have not so far disclos@@ ed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them seem susp@@ icious .
According to information provided by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , they are referred to internally at the IA@@ EA as Mar@@ j as@@ -S@@ ult@@ an , Mas@@ y@@ af and I@@ sk@@ and@@ ari@@ ya , referring to towns nearby .
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington ( IS@@ IS ) has identified these locations and found a complex of buildings on satellite images at Mas@@ y@@ af which is very probably one of the susp@@ icious buildings .
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that Syria is ref@@ using the IA@@ EA access to the three locations .
In Vienna , there is word that the Syri@@ ans were afraid of some kind of fishing ex@@ pedition and worry that the IA@@ EA is being sent out by the USA as a van@@ guard to sp@@ y out military facilities .
This fear was exacerb@@ ated by the fact that nuclear inspec@@ tors had been ti@@ pped off about the facilities by the US secret services .
The IA@@ EA has documents , including satellite photos , which suggest that material has been transported between the three locations and the cu@@ be@@ -@@ shaped building on the E@@ up@@ hr@@ ates river .
A high-@@ ranking western diplom@@ at in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be &quot; related to fuel production . &quot;
However , there were &quot; no signs of sensitive activities &quot; such as ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment or re@@ processing - processes that are required to build atom@@ ic weapons .
This type of re@@ actor is fu@@ elled by ur@@ anium , but not enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium .
However , a reasonable gu@@ ess could be made as to where the ur@@ anium came from and where the pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um from that ur@@ anium would be extrac@@ ted for use in a bomb .
It remains unclear , however , whether rub@@ ble that could contain valuable trace deposits has been stored at the three locations .
No one is ad@@ mitting to having any information on where the rub@@ ble has ended up , as if hundreds of tru@@ ck@@ loads of earth had simply van@@ ished into thin air .
The salt mine of Al Ti@@ b@@ ni , located just several kilometres from El Ki@@ bar on the other side of the E@@ up@@ hr@@ ates and investigated by Syria in 1998 as a possible storage location for radioactive waste is an unlikely location , according to the IA@@ EA .
The former IA@@ EA inspec@@ tor Robert Kel@@ ley recently connected the mine and the re@@ actor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine , Jan@@ e &apos;s Intelli@@ gence Review .
Images from or@@ bit , however , show that Syria under@@ took earth@@ works at the three susp@@ ected locations and removed large containers after the IA@@ EA had demanded access .
That may be coinci@@ dence , but has done nothing to clear sus@@ pic@@ ion .
There is also talk in diplomatic circles of the IA@@ EA having spent a number of months developing an inspections plan that would allow Syria to protect any military sec@@ rets - the costs alone shows the extent of the inspec@@ tors &quot; interest .
Dam@@ as@@ cus , however , also br@@ us@@ hed off this proposal .
Although western diplom@@ ats in Vienna had offered re@@ assurance , by saying that since the re@@ actor was destroyed the issue had low priority , the US amb@@ ass@@ ador Gl@@ yn Davi@@ es has been bringing so-called special inspections to the table , which is one of the most powerful instruments available to the Vi@@ enn@@ a-@@ based atom@@ ic authority to carry out inspections .
Yu@@ ki@@ ya A@@ man@@ o , current Director General of the IA@@ EA , who is believed to have suggested the inspection , has already spoken of &quot; an option that I am open to in the future , &quot; but is still hes@@ it@@ ating .
The option is high risk . On the one hand it requires a majority in the Govern@@ ing Council of the IA@@ EA , and a number of the 35 countries represented are anything other than e@@ ager for escal@@ ation .
On the other hand , as one diplom@@ at points out , &quot; what if , in the end , they find nothing ? &quot;
Love in times of war
Since Angel@@ ina Jo@@ lie began working on her as yet anonymous direc@@ ting de@@ but in the summer , there has been trouble .
She wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man .
No one really knows much more than that - but that alone is enough to cause un@@ ease .
The rum@@ our st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly per@@ si@@ sts that the woman - a Muslim - falls in love with her Serbian rap@@ ist during the Yugosla@@ vian war .
Bosni@@ an women &apos;s organisations have prot@@ ested immediately , in response to which several days of shooting planned in Sar@@ aj@@ evo were moved to Hungary at short notice .
Since then , the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-@@ production , but there are still protests in Bosnia .
Bak@@ ira Has@@ e@@ č@@ i@@ ć from the Association of Women Vic@@ tims of War wrote to Jo@@ lie via the UN refugee agency UN@@ H@@ CR and demanded a meeting with the act@@ ress , reported a Bosni@@ an newspaper - Jo@@ lie herself is an amb@@ ass@@ ador for the UN agency .
However , she can hardly be described as diplomatic - Jo@@ lie offered to meet the women weeks ago in Hungary , but they dec@@ lined .
The meeting must take place in Bosnia , insi@@ sts Has@@ e@@ č@@ i@@ ć .
According to Has@@ e@@ č@@ i@@ ć , there were no love stories in rap@@ e camps , and Jo@@ lie &apos;s behaviour towards victims told her enough about the script .
According to the UN refugee organisation , her organisation has recommended dis@@ missing Jo@@ lie as an amb@@ ass@@ ador , reports the Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
But what kind of script exactly has Jo@@ lie written ?
The Bosni@@ an Ministry of Culture that read her script issued a permit for shooting in Sar@@ aj@@ evo after some to-@@ ing and fro@@ -@@ ing - it is not entirely clear why Jo@@ lie then did not go to Bosnia .
They fle@@ d@@ g@@ ling writer herself asser@@ ts that she has no political mo@@ tives in her film , has read up on the Yugosla@@ vian conflict assi@@ du@@ ously and wants to show the hor@@ rif@@ ic consequences of war and give a voice to all sides involved .
In terms of content , however , she remained vague .
A second , considerably different syn@@ op@@ sis of the film is being circul@@ ated on the internet . The lovers had known each other before the out@@ break of war and meet again when she , a Bosni@@ an Muslim , is kid@@ n@@ apped to a Serbian camp where he is working as a guard .
That sounds a very different story to the &quot; rap@@ e victim falls for tor@@ tur@@ er &quot; scenario .
The fact that Jo@@ lie &apos;s film actually begins before the war is clear .
According to Jo@@ lie , the pressure on her is &quot; unfair and based on false information . &quot;
Now only the h@@ ack@@ ers from Hollywood can give her any peace by illegally posting the script on the web , as has been the fate of so many other scripts .
Let &apos;s get out of here
This evening , everything is finally going well for the Irish .
Not a trace of un@@ happiness .
The home team is domin@@ ating its guests from Sweden , Finland and the USA too much for that .
The fans are ho@@ oting for joy against a sound@@ track of b@@ lar@@ ing music and st@@ amp@@ ing feet .
The Bai@@ ley Pub in Cor@@ k , southern Ireland , is ro@@ cking because the table tennis players are thro@@ wing ping p@@ ong balls into beer gl@@ asses over a three met@@ re distance - and sc@@ oring .
&quot; Be@@ er p@@ ong &quot; is the name of the bizarre spectac@@ le ; the winner gets 500 Euros win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer p@@ ong world champ@@ ionship in January .
C@@ ian T@@ anner is a quiet type ; this sh@@ ri@@ ll drinking game and the re@@ tic@@ ent computer scienti@@ st do not really go together .
But the 26@@ -@@ year-old is trying to am@@ use himself by playing , to di@@ stra@@ ct from the burning question of what the future will bring .
He has not scheduled in a round of gambling in Las Vegas - he will be taking part in job interviews in New Zealand in January .
&quot; I have a wei@@ rd feeling doing it , &quot; he says .
&quot; It is so far from home and I still don &apos;t have any work there . &quot;
Still , his gir@@ l@@ friend is waiting for him in Au@@ ck@@ land - &quot; she got her dream job as event manager in no time - perhaps a good sign , &quot; says the young man and sm@@ iles .
In response to the poor outlook at home , two of T@@ anner &apos;s three si@@ bl@@ ings are already taking their chances abroad .
His sister Y@@ von@@ ne , a social worker , is in Sydney and his brother Co@@ lin has got a job as an IT consult@@ ant in London .
Young people are leaving . T@@ anner &apos;s family is hardly the exception for families on the island .
100@@ ,000 Irish men and women will leave the country in the near future , predic@@ t experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ( ES@@ RI ) in Dublin .
By 2015 , they estimate a total of 200@@ ,000 emi@@ grants .
For a small country with only 4.@@ 5 million inhabitants , that will be a significant loss .
If the predic@@ tions prove to be correct , there will be a wave of emi@@ gr@@ ation comparable to the emi@@ gr@@ ation Ireland suffered in the 8@@ 0s .
After a decade of growth that brought great prosperity for the Irish with it , the hard times have returned .
The economic crisis is particularly be@@ wil@@ dering for young , well-@@ educated Irish who have only seen things getting better .
Job losses and social des@@ cent seemed absurd in the boom years .
Everyone was needed and there was money abo@@ und@@ ing .
Since then , three out of every ten men and women under thirty are without work .
In the Irish Times , there are many letters from young emi@@ grants compl@@ aining that &quot; everything is going down the p@@ an in Ireland . &quot;
&quot; There should be a revolution against the politicians and ban@@ kers - but anyone who can simply leaves and our country is losing an entire generation . &quot;
&quot; Can the last person please turn out the light . &quot;
Law student Le@@ anne C@@ aul@@ field , President of the Irish Union of Stu@@ dents , sees a dis@@ mal future ahead , because the government is engaged in wind@@ ow-@@ dres@@ sing and is no longer offering young people prospects for the future .
&quot; They are reducing the minimum wage , but they don &apos;t have a strategy to create new jobs , &quot; says the 20-@@ year-old .
She sees her fellow students making their way from one un@@ paid intern@@ ship to another .
Her greatest concern is that she will have to emi@@ gr@@ ate in four years as well .
&quot; The thought is sad and de@@ pressing . &quot;
On the other hand , men such as Stephen Mc@@ Lar@@ non try to give the situation a positive sp@@ in .
Mc@@ Lar@@ non organis@@ es the Wor@@ king@@ Ab@@ road@@ Expo , a fair offering an all-@@ round service for work abroad .
&quot; For people starting a career , working abroad is a great chance to take your first steps onto the career lad@@ der , &quot; says the manager .
There are photos of sur@@ fers in Australia and snow@@ boar@@ ders in Canada on his website .
The message is clear . Working abroad is not gal@@ ley duty , but a source of freedom and fun .
For the last six months , Se@@ án O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an has known what it feels like to build something somewhere else .
As there was nothing more for the 29@@ -@@ year-old engineer in Ireland , he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on building sites in Germany .
They are currently working on a fashion boutique in Gel@@ sen@@ kir@@ chen .
In January , they will move on to Han@@ over or Berlin - to the next project .
In the meantime , O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an visits his home country sel@@ dom , as he is taking on extra shi@@ fts to be able to pay off the mort@@ gage on his house at home .
&quot; The situation is really a bit cra@@ zy , &quot; he says , as he goes through the door of his house for the first time in a long time .
&quot; I am earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I barely see . &quot;
He lau@@ ghs a little self-@@ consci@@ ously and wander@@ s through the cold rooms .
The small house is in a class@@ y neighbourhood with t@@ ended front gardens . Large , expensive cars are par@@ ked in the dri@@ ve@@ ways .
O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an bought the house with his sister four years ago for 3@@ 80@@ ,000 Euros - financed with a 100 percent mort@@ gage .
&quot; They were mad times - there was easy money without too many questions , &quot; he says .
Is he worried that things could go wrong with the mort@@ gage ?
O &apos;@@ Don@@ ov@@ an thinks for a while , po@@ urs some more tea and says : &quot; I don &apos;t have any children to feed and I am young . Even if everything goes wrong , I can start again . &quot;
The civil engineer does not like the mo@@ aning that he h@@ ears so often .
&quot; No one has to star@@ ve - out situation is no@@ where near as dramatic as times this island has gone through in the past , &quot; he says .
&quot; Working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps we only really feel Irish by going abroad . &quot;
He lau@@ ghs and rec@@ alls how his father went to England in the last great economic crisis .
&quot; Seven years later , he was back and life went on in Ireland , just like that . &quot;
C@@ ian T@@ anner likes that idea .
Le@@ ave the future open and just see what it is like living somewhere else .
He has already spent a few years working in London and why should things not go well for him and his gir@@ l@@ fri@@ endi@@ n New Zealand ?
One thing still wor@@ ries him well and truly these days - the party for his 27@@ th birthday on Friday in Dublin .
He wor@@ ries it could de@@ generate into a f@@ are@@ well party .
&quot; Just not too much emo@@ tion , &quot; he says and drinks a large gul@@ p of beer .
&quot; F@@ are@@ well - that sounds alarming . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ets just call it a going away party , really relaxed with a few friends , a couple of drinks and the od@@ d game . &quot;
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to edge up , as does backing for private enterprise .
Cri@@ me has become a bigger worry than unemployment .
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region .
Those are some of the findings of the latest Lat@@ in@@ ob@@ ar@@ ó@@ metro pol@@ l taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Econom@@ ist .
Because the pol@@ l has been taken regularly since 1995 , it tracks changes in attitude across the region .
Two related things stand out in the results of this year &apos;s pol@@ l , taken in September and early October .
The first is Latin America &apos;s fairly sunny mood .
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions .
Support for democracy has risen notic@@ e@@ ably in several countries on the Pacific ri@@ m of South America ( see table 1 ) .
For example in Peru , where economic growth has aver@@ aged 6 % a year since 2002 , support for democracy has risen from a low of 40 % in 2005 to 61 % this year .
It also rose in Mexico , where the economy has recover@@ ed after suffering a big drop in output last year .
But only around half of respon@@ dents in Mexico and Brazil , the region &apos;s two most popul@@ ous countries , are convinced democ@@ rats , which dra@@ gs down the regional average ( see chart 2 ) .
Some 44 % of respon@@ dents across the region pron@@ ounced themselves satisfied with how their country &apos;s democracy works in practice , the same figure as last year but a big increase on the 25 % in 2001 ( chart 3 ) .
Some 34 % said they had confidence in their country &apos;s Congress and 45 % in their government , the same as last year in both cases but up sharp@@ ly from 2003 ( 17 % and 24 % respectively ) .
A decade ago economic wo@@ es in Latin America undermined support for democracy .
That it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery .
In addition , a stronger social safety net has helped to shi@@ eld the poor .
( The United Nations &apos; Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only margin@@ ally in 2009 and has fallen again this year , to 32 % . )
But the mood varies widely from country to country ( see chart 4 ) .
Brazil &apos;s strong economic performance and the popularity of its out@@ going president , Lu@@ iz In@@ á@@ cio L@@ ula da Sil@@ va , is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress .
That is scar@@ c@@ er in Mexico and Central America , where the recession was more severe and violent crime has wor@@ sen@@ ed .
For only the second time since the poll@@ s began , more respon@@ dents across Latin America as a whole c@@ ite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem facing their country ( see chart 5 ) .
Some 31 % say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from 38 % last year and is the lowest figure since 1995 .
A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy : some 71 % of respon@@ dents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from 56 % in 2007 ( see chart 6 ) .
Some 58 % agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed , up from 47 % last year .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , 62 % of respon@@ dents in Venezuela hold that view ( and 80 % there back private enterprise ) even though their left-@@ wing president , Hu@@ go Ch@@ á@@ vez , is ex@@ propri@@ ating many private companies .
Brazil is the country which exercises most leadership in the region , mentioned by 19 % of respon@@ dents ( up from 18 % last year ) , followed by the United States ( 9 % , un@@ changed from last year ) and Venezuela ( 9 % , down from 11 % last year ) .
But the United States is seen as the most influential country by respon@@ dents in Mexico and much of Central America , whereas Venezuela enjoys that distinction in Ecu@@ ador , the Domin@@ ican Republic and Nic@@ ar@@ agua .
A vote rub@@ bished
Nob@@ ody expected Haiti &apos;s general election on November 28@@ th to be perfect .
But it was far worse than the out@@ si@@ ders who are trying to help the stri@@ cken country fear@@ ed .
It featured stu@@ ff@@ ed bal@@ lot boxes and repeat voting , bal@@ lot sli@@ ps sc@@ attered in gut@@ ters , tr@@ ashed poll@@ ing stations and intim@@ id@@ ation .
Poll@@ ing stations opened hours late .
Many Hai@@ ti@@ ans , including lots displaced by January &apos;s earthquake , ro@@ amed around trying to find out where to vote .
Some of them eventually gave up .
A do@@ zen presidential candidates , including several presum@@ ed fron@@ t-@@ run@@ ners , cri@@ ed fraud and called for the election &apos;s ann@@ ul@@ ment .
Prot@@ ests , some of them violent , f@@ lar@@ ed across the country .
Nevertheless , Ed@@ mond Mu@@ let , the United Nations &apos; top official in Haiti , declared it &quot; a fairly good election in many ways . &quot;
Ob@@ servers from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community said cau@@ ti@@ ously that they did &quot; not believe these irregularities , serious as they were , necessarily invali@@ dated the process . &quot;
In other words , the show goes on .
The electoral authority , which opponents claim is beh@@ ol@@ den to Ren@@ é Pr@@ é@@ val , the un@@ popular out@@ going president and his candidate , Ju@@ de C@@ é@@ l@@ esti@@ n , is due to announce preliminary results on December 7th .
The expected run@@ -@@ off is scheduled for January .
All hope in the election is not lost .
The two leading opposition candidates , Michel Mar@@ tel@@ ly , a ra@@ p musi@@ cian , and Mir@@ lan@@ de Man@@ ig@@ at , a former first lady , have re@@ treated from their initial call for the vote to be declared invali@@ d .
But there may be trouble if Mr C@@ é@@ l@@ esti@@ n , who has little or no dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble support among voters , is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the run@@ -@@ off .
With a ch@@ ol@@ era epide@@ mic ra@@ ging , and more than 1@@ m earthquake survi@@ vors still living in t@@ ents , there were fears that turn@@ out would be low .
In the event , a lot of Hai@@ ti@@ ans wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so by dis@@ organisation .
Some 25@@ 0@@ ,000 identity cards , required for voting , remained un@@ distributed shortly before the election .
Much is at stake .
Aid donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in Haiti &apos;s reconstruction .
And so , it is clear , do Hai@@ ti@@ ans themselves .
Ti@@ p@@ to@@ eing to the centre
In the weeks since she was suddenly wid@@ owed , Crist@@ ina Fern@@ án@@ dez , Argentina &apos;s president , has benef@@ ited from a wave of public sympathy that has boo@@ sted her approval rating by 20 points , to over 50 % , its highest level since she was elected in 2007 .
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year may depend on whether or not the visi@@ bly gri@@ ev@@ ing Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez aband@@ ons the in@@ transi@@ gence of her late husband , predecessor and political partner , N@@ é@@ st@@ or Kir@@ chner .
And on that the signs are mixed .
Mr Kir@@ chner , who continued to handle economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president , was in the hab@@ it of drawing up budgets which under@@ estimated tax revenues , economic growth and inflation .
That allowed the first couple to spend the extra revenues at will .
On paper Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez &apos;s government lost its majority in Congress last year .
But the opposition is divided , and it was thrown further into dis@@ array by Mr Kir@@ chner &apos;s death of a heart attack on October 27@@ th .
Some dis@@ si@@ dent members of the ruling Per@@ on@@ ist movement have r@@ alli@@ ed to Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez .
But after cha@@ otic sessions ( in which a parliament@@ arian pun@@ ched another in the face , and others accused the government of bri@@ ber@@ y ) , Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget .
&quot; I &apos;m not going to argue , &quot; said the president .
The 2010 budget will now apply next year , giving the president even more room to spend at will .
The economy is over@@ heating wild@@ ly : it is likely to grow by up to 9 % this year .
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.@@ 1 % , but many private estimates - and tra@@ de-@@ union wage demands - put the figure close to 30 % .
Mr Kir@@ chner , who took office in 2003 when Argentina was scar@@ red by economic collapse , made growth and poverty reduction , rather than controlling inflation , his priorities .
He refused to deal with the IMF , har@@ ass@@ ed the private sector and pur@@ ged IN@@ D@@ EC , the statistics agency , which proceed@@ ed to doctor official inflation statistics .
Mi@@ ght Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez now moderate these policies ?
She has called for talks between private business and union leaders .
And her officials are saying that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18 % .
The economy has been bu@@ o@@ yed by high world prices for Argentina &apos;s farm exports .
But inflation has ero@@ ded the boost to growth provided by a big de@@ valu@@ ation in 2002 .
That may be why Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina &apos;s financial ties to the rest of the world .
Ear@@ lier this year the government struck a deal with b@@ ond@@ holders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of debt on which Argentina def@@ aul@@ ted in 2001 .
Now Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez seems to be ed@@ ging towards an agreement with credi@@ tor governments group@@ ed in the Paris Club , to which it ow@@ es some $ 6.@@ 7 billion .
The Kir@@ ch@@ ners always insi@@ sted this could not involve over@@ sight by the IMF , as is custom@@ ary .
But last month Ama@@ do Bou@@ d@@ ou , the economy minister , announced that the fund will provide &quot; technical assistance &quot; to design a new national consu@@ mer@@ -@@ price index , which looks like a prel@@ ude to cleaning up IN@@ D@@ EC .
It is not clear whether Ms Fern@@ án@@ dez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term now that her husband is no longer at her side .
If she does , she needs to win the support of the middle class , much of which has tired of kir@@ ch@@ ner@@ ismo .
By the time Argent@@ ines return from their summer holidays in March , the wave of sympathy for her will have eb@@ bed .
If she wants to win another election she will have to decide whether or not quiet@@ ly to rep@@ u@@ di@@ ate many of her husband &apos;s policies .
Hal@@ f a che@@ er for China
Taiwan &apos;s voters are in@@ ching towards a kind of closer union with the main@@ land .
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the stra@@ it ?
More than 7.@@ 5@@ m voters turned out on November 27@@ th , 70 % of those eligible , to elect may@@ ors and city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors in five urban districts , in what is seen as a broad assessment of the president , M@@ a Y@@ ing-@@ je@@ ou .
Mr M@@ a himself has become a sur@@ ro@@ gate for feelings about the main@@ land , having for@@ ged ground@@ breaking business links , including a partial free-@@ trade pact , in the biggest re@@ arrangement of relations with China proper since 1949 .
Mr M@@ a passed the test , but only just .
Although his Ku@@ om@@ int@@ ang party ( KM@@ T ) ended up winning three of the five may@@ or@@ alties , it failed to win a majority of the votes .
Instead , the Democratic Pro@@ gressive Party ( D@@ PP ) , which has le@@ ant towards ful@@ ler independence for Taiwan , won nearly 50 % of all votes to the KM@@ T &apos;s 45 % .
H@@ ad this been a presidential pol@@ l , Mr M@@ a would be in trouble .
Since he was elected two years ago his party &apos;s share of the vote has fallen by perhaps 8 % .
For the first time , the D@@ PP drew even with the KM@@ T in the city coun@@ cils .
The election saw most of the sta@@ ples of Tai@@ w@@ anese elections , including row@@ dy campaign trucks and flag@@ -@@ w@@ aving mass r@@ allies with sk@@ imp@@ ily cla@@ d dancing girls .
It even saw the obligatory mysteri@@ ous assass@@ ination attempt .
S@@ ean Li@@ en , son of Li@@ en Ch@@ an , the KM@@ T &apos;s hon@@ or@@ ary chairman , was st@@ umping for a KM@@ T candidate on the eve of the election .
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr Li@@ en clean through the face , wo@@ und@@ ing him and killing a b@@ yst@@ ander .
B@@ iz@@ ar@@ rely , it has not been determined whether the g@@ un@@ man intended to harm Mr Li@@ en or to settle a dispute with the candidate .
Ei@@ ther way , says T@@ sa@@ i In@@ g-@@ wen , the leader of the D@@ PP , the shooting affected the election , casting sus@@ pic@@ ion on the D@@ PP and driving voters towards the KM@@ T .
Perhaps the only big winner from the campaign was China .
It was striking how the issue of the main@@ land itself was ab@@ sent .
Instead candidates j@@ ou@@ sted over plans for public housing and job creation .
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and lo@@ ath@@ es China &apos;s military threat .
So , the KM@@ T tends to avoid par@@ ading its ties to the government in Beijing .
But this time the D@@ PP also refra@@ ined from whi@@ pping up anti-@@ China sen@@ timent .
It is responding to a new awareness that Chinese business is essential to Taiwan &apos;s economic survival .
Mr M@@ a , for his part , claimed confirmation that his China policy is acceptable to the Tai@@ w@@ anese majority .
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue supplying commercial swe@@ eten@@ ers , in line with its strategy for l@@ uring Taiwan back to the fold .
China wast@@ ed no time sending a negoti@@ ator to Tai@@ p@@ ei to arrange for a summit on investment protection and medical co-operation .
Certainly , it would like to see political integration too , but first things first .
Better to wait till after the 2012 presidential election for that .
The D@@ PP has anyway re@@ invented itself .
Two years ago it was at a low point : its former leader , Ch@@ en Sh@@ u@@ i-@@ bian , had been sent to j@@ ail on charges of corruption .
President in 2000-@@ 08 , he was a fire@@ brand for explicit independence .
But under the leadership of Ms T@@ sa@@ i , a new generation of moder@@ ates has emerged and the D@@ PP is working hard to attract professionals and you@@ ths .
Ms T@@ sa@@ i has been ha@@ iled as a D@@ PP candidate for the presidency , as has Su T@@ sen@@ g-@@ chan@@ g , who served under Mr Ch@@ en .
Their party is now doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing .
Ms T@@ sa@@ i announced plans for a thin@@ k-@@ tank to act as a point of contact between the D@@ PP and China , provided their talks can be held without pre@@ conditions .
Ms T@@ sa@@ i tells the Tai@@ w@@ anese public that her party presents a &quot; tru@@ st@@ worthy alternative &quot; to Mr M@@ a &apos;s ha@@ sty approach to China .
Mr Ch@@ en seems in@@ fur@@ i@@ ated by the shift .
In a statement issued from his cell he said that the D@@ PP &apos;s candidates would have far@@ ed better if they had insi@@ sted that Taiwan is a separate country .
He even ordered Mr Su , a pragm@@ ati@@ st , not to run for the presidency .
Even without Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s interference , the D@@ PP will struggle to choose between its potential candidates .
The KM@@ T is due for sou@@ l-@@ searching of its own .
Mr M@@ a &apos;s ratings have been poor , despite break@@ neck economic growth ; KM@@ T candidates have not wanted to campaign with him .
His un@@ popularity seems to be owing largely to unemployment and the wi@@ dening gap between rich and poor .
A KM@@ T spo@@ kes@@ man says it will res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le its cab@@ inet as well as its local branches .
The D@@ PP &apos;s strong showing suggests that Taiwan &apos;s support for rap@@ proch@@ ement is limited .
At the same time most Tai@@ w@@ anese see the economic integration with China as inevitable .
According to Antonio Chi@@ ang , a prominent colum@@ n@@ ist , &quot; the point of no return has already passed . &quot;
Gr@@ amm@@ y nom@@ inations : Jazz singer E@@ sper@@ anza Sp@@ al@@ ding is a surprise pick in best new artist category
Per@@ form at the request of a president , and people are bound to take notice .
E@@ sper@@ anza Sp@@ al@@ ding , the 26@@ -@@ year-old jazz b@@ assist and singer hand-@@ picked by President Obama to perform at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009 , marked one of the Gr@@ amm@@ ys &apos; sur@@ prises this year with a high-@@ profile nom@@ ination in the best new artist category .
Consi@@ dering that Sp@@ al@@ ding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album , &quot; E@@ sper@@ anza , &quot; the nom@@ ination is a bit of a head@@ -@@ scrat@@ cher , but it is consistent with the Gr@@ amm@@ ys &apos; rules of an artist not rel@@ easing more than three alb@@ ums before the recording that &quot; establishes the public identity of that artist . &quot;
Her ambitious 2010 album , &quot; Chamber Music Society , &quot; certainly marked a step forward , and given her ai@@ ri@@ ly inviting vocal style and a de@@ ft hand with pop , funk and Latin influences , it &apos;s possible to draw at least a dot@@ ted line to Sp@@ al@@ ding from Nor@@ ah Jones &apos; run@@ away success in 2003 , the closest equivalent to Gr@@ amm@@ y voters looking toward jazz &apos;s neighborhood in this category in recent years .
El@@ sewhere Gr@@ amm@@ y voters rightly hon@@ ored the Vi@@ j@@ ay I@@ yer Tri@@ o &apos;s &quot; Histor@@ ic@@ ity &quot; in the instru@@ mental album category , an in@@ vigor@@ ating thri@@ ll@@ -@@ ride of a record that was a critical favorite last year .
Among those I@@ yer will be competing against include veter@@ an sa@@ x@@ op@@ hon@@ ist James M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy 4@@ B &quot; and key@@ bo@@ ardi@@ st John Be@@ as@@ ley &apos;s &quot; Posi@@ to@@ ot@@ ly . &quot;
Tro@@ mb@@ one Sh@@ or@@ ty , a rau@@ c@@ ous New Or@@ le@@ ans favorite and frequent guest on H@@ B@@ O &apos;s &quot; Tre@@ me , &quot; was hon@@ ored in the contemporary jazz category , which otherwise til@@ ts heavily toward fusion with no@@ ds toward alb@@ ums by Stan@@ ley Clar@@ ke , John Mc@@ Lau@@ gh@@ lin and J@@ ef@@ f Lor@@ ber .
The wild , ste@@ amp@@ unk@@ -@@ informed Dar@@ cy James Ar@@ gue &apos;s Sec@@ ret Society earned some well-@@ deser@@ ved recognition in the large ens@@ emble category , competing against the Bil@@ ly Chil@@ ds Ensem@@ ble &apos;s rich cham@@ ber-@@ jazz and the ever-@@ adv@@ entur@@ ous Da@@ ve Holland , whose oc@@ tet &apos;s live album &quot; P@@ ath@@ ways &quot; was a fine example of the b@@ assist &apos;s democratic hand as a band@@ leader .

P@@ är@@ t &apos;s Symph@@ ony No. 4 had its premi@@ ere at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance that was recorded by the L@@ .@@ A. Philharmon@@ ic , conducted by E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pek@@ ka Sal@@ onen .
The approximately 30-@@ minute piece is du@@ b@@ bed &quot; Los Angeles &quot; and is dedicated to former oil ty@@ co@@ on Mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , who is impris@@ oned in Russia .

Pro@@ posed Tem@@ ec@@ ula mos@@ que wins planning commission approval
A proposed mos@@ que in Tem@@ ec@@ ula has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission following more than five hours of often heated public testim@@ ony .
Cri@@ tics ass@@ ailed the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic ti@@ e-@@ ups .
But commission@@ ers ruled Wednesday night the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aes@@ the@@ tically impressive .
&quot; Many good people came to support it - Christians , Jews , Ba@@ ha@@ is , you name it , &quot; said Ha@@ di Na@@ el , chair of the Islamic Center of Tem@@ ec@@ ula Valley , speaking Thursday morning .
&quot; I &apos;m proud of that as an American citizen . &quot;
&quot; It shows that justice prev@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; The opposition is very minimal , &quot; he added .
&quot; They just have very loud voices . &quot;
&quot; We have beautiful people in this valley . &quot;
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and la@@ sted until nearly mid@@ night with most of the time taken up with people speaking for or against the center , about even@@ ly divided , according to the Pres@@ s-@@ Enterprise .
The debate continued on the newspaper &apos;s website .
&quot; There is no more America , &quot; wrote one comm@@ enter .
&quot; It is another Planet of the Ap@@ es with Mis@@ s Liber@@ ty dead in the sand . &quot;
&quot; America has fallen . &quot;
Pl@@ ann@@ ed Islamic centers also have spark@@ ed protests in other parts of the country , including near ground zero , the site of the S@@ ept . 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in New York City .
In the Tem@@ ec@@ ula Valley , Ima@@ m Mah@@ m@@ oud Har@@ mou@@ sh has den@@ ounced violence .
His con@@ greg@@ ation of about 135 families has co-@@ existed without incident in Ri@@ ver@@ side County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the wareh@@ ouse it r@@ ented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water@@ -@@ fil@@ tration systems .
The new 24@@ ,@@ 9@@ 4@@ 3-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ foot mos@@ que with Medi@@ terran@@ e@@ an-@@ style architecture would include two min@@ ar@@ ets and rise as t@@ all as 43 feet .
It would occup@@ y a 4.@@ 3@@ 2-@@ ac@@ re site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Cha@@ par@@ ral High School .
O@@ pp@@ on@@ ents can still appeal the project to the City Council .
Ar@@ sen@@ ic-@@ toler@@ ant micro@@ be raises possibility of new types of life on Earth , or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacter@@ ia that can use ar@@ sen@@ ic as one of its nutri@@ ents wi@@ dens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond .
While researchers discovered the unusual bacter@@ ia here on Earth , they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential .
&quot; This organis@@ m has dual capability . &quot;
&quot; It can grow with either pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous or ar@@ sen@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; That makes it very pec@@ uli@@ ar , though it falls short of being some form of truly &apos; alien &apos; life , &quot; comm@@ ented Paul C. W. Davi@@ es of Ari@@ zona State University , a co-@@ author of the report appearing in Thursday &apos;s online edition of the journ@@ al Science .
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life - carbon , hydro@@ gen , nit@@ ro@@ gen , oxy@@ gen , pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us and sul@@ fur .
But the researchers found that the bacter@@ ia , discovered in Mon@@ o Lake , C@@ ali@@ f . , is able to continue to grow after sub@@ stit@@ uting ar@@ sen@@ ic for pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous .
&quot; It makes you wonder what else is possible , &quot; said Ari@@ el D. An@@ bar of Ari@@ zona State University , a co-@@ author of the report .
The find is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life , to know what life looks like , An@@ bar said .
The study focuses on a micro@@ be found on Earth .
However , the announcement of a news conference to discuss it , which did not disc@@ lose details of the find , generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disc@@ lose the discovery of ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life .
It didn &apos;t .
The discovery &quot; does show that in other plan@@ etary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive bio@@ chem@@ istry and that the &apos; standard &apos; set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed , &quot; comm@@ ented Charles Cock@@ ell , professor at the Plan@@ etary and Space Sciences Research Institute , Open University , in Mil@@ ton Keyn@@ es , United Kingdom .
Cock@@ ell was not part of the research team .
&quot; This work is novel because it shows the sub@@ stitution of one element for another in fundamental bio@@ chem@@ istry and bio@@ chemical structure , &quot; added Cock@@ ell .
It wasn &apos;t a chance discovery .
Fel@@ is@@ a Wol@@ fe@@ -S@@ im@@ on of N@@ ASA &apos;s A@@ stro@@ bi@@ ology Institute , who led the study , targeted Mon@@ o Lake because it has high ar@@ sen@@ ic levels .
Ar@@ sen@@ ic and pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous are chem@@ ically similar , so she spec@@ ulated that a micro@@ be exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other .
&quot; Ar@@ sen@@ ic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to that of pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us . &quot;
&quot; As a result , organisms have a hard time telling these elements apart . &quot;
&quot; But ar@@ sen@@ ic is different enough that it doesn &apos;t work as well as pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , so it gets in there and sort of g@@ ums up the works of our bio@@ chemical machinery , &quot; explained An@@ bar .
The researchers collected the bacter@@ ia known as G@@ FA@@ J@@ -@@ 1 and exposed it to increasing concentr@@ ations of ar@@ sen@@ ic , which it was able to adapt to and grow .
The micro@@ be does grow better on pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous , but showing that it can live with ar@@ sen@@ ic instead raises the possibility that a life form using ar@@ sen@@ ic could occur naturally , either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where ar@@ sen@@ ic is more common .
Jam@@ ie S. Fo@@ ster , an assi@@ stant professor of micro@@ bi@@ ology at the University of Florida , said the idea that ar@@ sen@@ ic could be sub@@ stituted for pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ ous isn &apos;t new , but there has never been example where it was shown to work .
Ar@@ sen@@ ic was more common in the early times on Earth , she said , so researchers have spec@@ ulated that early life forms might have used it .
&quot; It does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life , not just how life formed on early Earth , &quot; said Fo@@ ster , who was not part of Wol@@ fe@@ -S@@ im@@ on &apos;s research team .
The research was supported by N@@ ASA , the Department of Energy and the National In@@ stitutes of Health .
Rem@@ aining st@@ olen show dogs found in Comp@@ ton
The remaining two of four show dogs st@@ olen from outside a Bell@@ flower m@@ otel have been found , Los Angeles County Sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s officials said Thursday .
The four show dogs - two Ak@@ it@@ as and two P@@ em@@ broke Wel@@ sh cor@@ g@@ is - van@@ ished Tuesday when someone st@@ ole the 2006 Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let Express van they had spent the night in outside a Bell@@ flower M@@ otel 6 , authorities said .
Two of the can@@ ines were recover@@ ed Wednesday afternoon , and the remaining two were found late Wednesday evening , said to Steve Whit@@ more , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the Los Angeles County Sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s Department .
&quot; The good news is that the dogs are fine , &quot; said Whit@@ more .
&quot; They are in good condition . &quot;
&quot; They have been returned to their ri@@ ghtful owners . &quot;
Whit@@ more dec@@ lined to say precisely where the dogs were found , in what neighborhood , and the circumstances surrounding their discovery .
&quot; There is an investigation going on . &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t want to say , &quot; Whit@@ more said .
&quot; We are following leads . &quot;
The dogs owners , Kri@@ st@@ ina R@@ ick@@ ard and David Pe@@ ek , could not be reached for comment Thursday .
They were re@@ united with their two Ak@@ it@@ as at a coun@@ ty-@@ run animal shel@@ ter in D@@ ow@@ ney on Wednesday afternoon .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s dep@@ u@@ ties found the van and the two dogs separately in Comp@@ ton .
The Ak@@ it@@ as - Tra@@ ce , a 3-@@ year-old male , and Di@@ di , a 10-@@ mon@@ th-@@ old female - were un@@ har@@ med , authorities said .
But B@@ unny and Peter , the cor@@ g@@ is R@@ ick@@ ard and Pe@@ ek planned to show at area competitions this week on behalf of the dogs &apos; Japanese owners , remained missing until their discovering late Wednesday .
Pe@@ ek and R@@ ick@@ ard , who live in Red@@ ding , are in town for the AK@@ C / Eu@@ kan@@ uba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend , where they planned to show Tra@@ ce .
The other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AK@@ C / Eu@@ kan@@ uba show , Pe@@ ek told The Times on Wednesday .
Southern California is one stop on the couple &apos;s nearly mon@@ th-@@ long tour of dog shows .
On Monday night , Pe@@ ek and R@@ ick@@ ard checked into the m@@ otel .
They often stay in mot@@ els and park their van right outside their room window .
They brought three other dogs - a Bo@@ x@@ er pu@@ pp@@ y , a Par@@ son Rus@@ sell terri@@ er and a Britt@@ any - which stayed with them in the m@@ otel room .
But they left the thick@@ -@@ fur@@ red Ak@@ it@@ as and cor@@ g@@ is in the van where it would be cool@@ er .
They opened the windows a bit , so the dogs could get fresh air .
Pe@@ ek and R@@ ick@@ ard reported the van st@@ olen at 6 a.m. Tuesday .
Pe@@ ek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the cor@@ g@@ is , which are impl@@ anted with micro@@ chips to identify them .
It was unclear Thursday whether an award would be given .
L@@ ion ready to ro@@ ar again as M@@ GM restructuring gets final court go@@ -@@ ahead
After 18 months of tur@@ mo@@ il and uncertainty , M@@ GM has finally gotten a green light to start ane@@ w .
A New York federal bank@@ rupt@@ cy judge on Thursday officially bl@@ essed the &quot; pre-@@ pack@@ aged &quot; plan by credi@@ tors to wi@@ pe out about $ 5 billion in debt , cle@@ aring the way for the 8@@ 6-@@ year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and rel@@ easing movies and television shows .
With Thursday &apos;s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bank@@ rupt@@ cy code , no more legal obstacles remain for M@@ GM to rel@@ a@@ unch under Spy@@ glass Entertainment fo@@ under@@ s G@@ ary Bar@@ ber and Rog@@ er Bir@@ n@@ baum , who will become chief exec@@ u@@ tives of what will be a s@@ limm@@ ed-@@ down studio .
The staff will drop to about 3@@ 20 from over 400 .
M@@ GM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JP@@ Morgan Ch@@ ase clos@@ es a planned $ 500@@ -@@ million loan facility to fund the new M@@ GM &apos;s operations and productions .
It is currently being syn@@ dic@@ ated by the investment bank - which is itself k@@ icking in $ 75 million - and is expected to be funded by mid-@@ December .
The studio &apos;s restructuring process began in May 2009 , when investment bank Mo@@ el@@ is &amp; Co. was hi@@ red to advise management on how to fix its finances as it was stru@@ ggling to afford interest payments of $ 300 million per year .
That August , Chief Executive Harry Slo@@ an was replaced by Stephen Co@@ oper , a former CEO of En@@ ron and a turn@@ around expert known for his work at Kris@@ p@@ y Kre@@ me Dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts .
Mo@@ el@@ is &apos; and Co@@ oper &apos;s attempts to resolve M@@ GM &apos;s financial wo@@ es and satisfy the studio &apos;s 14@@ 0-@@ plus credi@@ tors took much longer than expected .
After several months of discussions , the parties agreed in late 2009 to put the company up for sale .
However , the auction attracted few bi@@ d@@ ders and none willing to pay the $ 2 billi@@ on-@@ plus that credi@@ tors were seeking .
By the spring of this year , it was back to the drawing board as the M@@ GM team began working on a restructuring plan that , after months of debate and internal dis@@ agreements , was finally endorsed by credi@@ tors in late October .
When M@@ GM officially emerg@@ es from bank@@ rupt@@ cy in the coming weeks , Mo@@ el@@ is and Co@@ oper &apos;s firms will receive mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on-@@ dollar bon@@ uses for their work .
Mo@@ el@@ is &amp; Co . , which has already received $ 1.2 million , will get a $ 9.@@ 5-@@ million payment .
Co@@ oper &apos;s firms , which have been collecting $ 3@@ 7@@ 5,000 per month for their services running the company , will receive a $ 4-@@ million &quot; success fee . &quot;
Bar@@ ber and Bir@@ n@@ baum plan to rest@@ art production at M@@ GM , which released only one movie this year , and put together an annual sl@@ ate of seven or eight films that will come out starting in 2012 .
They also plan to co-@@ finance two movies based on &quot; The Hob@@ bit , &quot; along with War@@ ner Bro@@ s.
The studio needs to close a separate loan of between $ 26@@ 5 million and $ 2@@ 75 million to fund its portion of those two movies , which are to be directed by Peter Jackson .
Invest@@ or Carl I@@ c@@ ahn , who owns about 18 % of M@@ GM &apos;s debt , had been seeking to arrange a mer@@ ger of the studio with Li@@ ons Gate Entertainment , in which he is the largest shar@@ eholder .
However , recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in a deal .
Tech To@@ ys to Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
While the leading candidate for this year &apos;s most mar@@ vel@@ ous to@@ y is the i@@ Pad , followed by , perhaps , a Microsoft Kin@@ ect video game system , both can put a significant dent in your gift budget .
Consi@@ der that for the price of one i@@ Pad , you can buy five $ 99 BM@@ X bicy@@ cles , and that one Kin@@ ect game costs the same as 10 classic be@@ aded jump ro@@ pes , or about 48 cans of Pla@@ y-@@ Doh .
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance .
I recently visited three national to@@ y s@@ ellers - a Wal@@ -@@ Mar@@ t , a To@@ ys &quot; R &quot; Us and a B@@ J &apos;s W@@ hol@@ es@@ ale Club - to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $ 80 .
It was immediately clear that Mo@@ ore &apos;s Law has been at work ; this year &apos;s technology to@@ y is likely to have more power , while co@@ sting the same if not a bit less compared with last year &apos;s .
In addition , while there are generally fewer new toys with associated Web sites , two of the most well known of this type , Web@@ kin@@ z and Club Pen@@ gu@@ in , have more offer@@ ings .
And but@@ t@@ on-@@ cell powered toys are increasing , as well as toys with re@@ char@@ g@@ able batteries .
Here are some recommendations .
( All prices are from To@@ ys &quot; R &quot; Us , except if otherwise noted . )
S@@ ing-@@ a-@@ ma-@@ j@@ ig@@ s ( M@@ att@@ el , $ 13 , for ages 3 and up ) are gu@@ ine@@ a pig@@ -@@ sized pl@@ ush toys that sing a note when you squ@@ ee@@ ze their bel@@ lies .
One squ@@ ee@@ ze equ@@ als one note , and a second squ@@ ee@@ ze starts building a song .
If you buy more than one , they &apos;ll sing in harmony .
Cau@@ tion : Once you start squ@@ ee@@ zing , you can &apos;t stop .
For singing combined with dancing , D@@ ance Star Mic@@ key ( Fis@@ her@@ -@@ Price , $ 60 , for ages 2 and up ) is the best choice .
Bor@@ rowing on last year &apos;s El@@ mo Live technology , the 14-@@ inch anim@@ at@@ ron@@ ic d@@ oll plays tur@@ n-@@ taking games like Simon S@@ ays , and can moon walk , thanks to his innovative hing@@ ed feet with lo@@ cking wheels .
Children testing the to@@ y used Mic@@ key as a dance instruc@@ tor although their parents compl@@ ained about the lack of a volume control .
If you &apos;re a child of the &apos; 8@@ 0s , you may recall Al@@ ph@@ ie , one of the first computer@@ ized educational toys .
He &apos;s back , ( Has@@ br@@ o / Play@@ sk@@ ool , $ 40 , for ages 3 and up ) , with a back@@ pack full of qui@@ z cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-@@ correc@@ ting , wis@@ ec@@ ra@@ cking work@@ book .
If you &apos;re le@@ ery of hand@@ ing your child your sm@@ art@@ phone , here are three stand@@ -@@ alone alternatives .
V@@ Tech &apos;s Mo@@ bi@@ Go ( $ 60 , for ages 3 to 8 ) is the che@@ apest and easi@@ est to use , featuring a q@@ wer@@ ty keyboard , although the games don &apos;t teach as effectively as the Le@@ ap@@ ster Explorer ( $ 70 , for ages 3 to 12 ) , Le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g &apos;s first major over@@ hau@@ l of the Le@@ ap@@ ster line , with a ne@@ wer , bri@@ ghter screen .
Neither version is compatible with older car@@ tri@@ dges .
Fis@@ her@@ -@@ Price &apos;s i@@ X@@ L ( $ 90 , for ages 3 to 7 ) uses an i@@ Tun@@ es-@@ like system to deliver games and e-@@ books , and has an SD card slot that makes it possible to display family photos .
Finally , S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble Flash ( $ 30 , Has@@ br@@ o , for ages 8 and up ) is a set of five blocks just larger than a book of matches , each with its own LED screen .
The goal is to make words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out ; it &apos;s great for an impro@@ mp@@ tu sp@@ elling contest .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , toys have some sort of online connection .
Based on their presence in to@@ y stores alone , the two largest are Web@@ kin@@ z and Club Pen@@ gu@@ in .
To buy your child an online pet in Club Pen@@ gu@@ in , for example , you can get a Disney Club Pen@@ gu@@ in 2 &quot; Mix &apos; N Mat@@ ch Fig@@ ure Pack , $ 5 , for ages 6 to 12 ) that includes a coin with a hidden code .
When you re@@ de@@ em the code online , your child is given enough credits in the Club Pen@@ gu@@ in store for any two items .
These might include roll@@ er sk@@ ates or a pet Pu@@ ff@@ le to@@ y .
S@@ ligh@@ tly larger than the bri@@ st@@ le-@@ end of your t@@ oo@@ th@@ brush , H@@ ex@@ bug N@@ ano ( $ 10 , for ages 5 and up ) is the latest in a line of but@@ t@@ on-@@ cell powered micro-@@ robots .
The f@@ aux bug moves quickly on 12 vibr@@ ating si@@ lic@@ on legs , in random directions .
It is fun to make a ma@@ ze out of blocks to see if it can find its way through .
It &apos;s dur@@ able , too .
O@@ urs was able to drop off the kitchen table and even spent some time inside our dog &apos;s mouth .
Br@@ ing@@ ing a Sof@@ ter Si@@ de to Po@@ lic@@ ing in China
Like an urban dri@@ ll ser@@ ge@@ ant , T@@ ang Sh@@ en@@ bin pac@@ ed on a city square , st@@ ern@@ ly insp@@ ecting his ner@@ vous charges , issuing s@@ otto vo@@ ce commands with military authority .
He wanted the female members of ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an - China &apos;s bur@@ ly enfor@@ c@@ ers of urban order , fear@@ ed and des@@ p@@ ised for their cap@@ ri@@ cious cra@@ ck@@ down@@ s and pen@@ ch@@ ant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a cl@@ ut@@ ch of on@@ lo@@ ok@@ ers .
&quot; Stand straight ! &quot;
&quot; Look sharp ! &quot;
Show them , he wh@@ is@@ pered , &quot; what pretty girls are like ! &quot;
Four bar@@ el@@ y-@@ past@@ -@@ teen@@ age girls in white glo@@ ves and identical olive jack@@ ets and p@@ ants sn@@ apped to attention .
Four p@@ airs of black pumps lined up rul@@ er-@@ straight .
Four pri@@ m h@@ ats per@@ ched perfectly at@@ op hair bound in blue and white stri@@ ped b@@ ows .
&quot; Person@@ ally , I think they are aver@@ age-@@ looking , &quot; Mr. T@@ ang said , dis@@ mis@@ sively .
&quot; Model@@ s are pretty . &quot;
More than one government has tried to brush up the image of China &apos;s urban inspec@@ tors .
One city mand@@ ated that all new recru@@ its have a college degree .
Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Province changed the gra@@ y-@@ green uni@@ forms to a supposedly more inviting blue .
Wu@@ han , in central China , sub@@ stituted st@@ are@@ -@@ down@@ s for strong@@ -@@ arming : in 2009 , one report stated , 50 officers en@@ cir@@ c@@ led a w@@ ay@@ ward snack car@@ t , glo@@ wer@@ ing ste@@ adily for a half hour until the ped@@ d@@ ler packed up and left .
X@@ indu , an urban district of 6@@ 80@@ ,000 in Ch@@ eng@@ du , has chosen major image surgery .
Since 2003 , the district has suppl@@ emented its urban street police with 13 women , specifically chosen for their looks , sha@@ pel@@ iness and youth .
The idea is to give the rou@@ gh@@ -@@ he@@ wn police a sof@@ ter , femin@@ ine side .
Unfortunately , even S@@ car@@ let@@ t Joh@@ an@@ sson might struggle to raise China &apos;s sub@@ terranean regard for these city squ@@ ads .
And for good reason , critics would argue .
Unlike the police , these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordin@@ ances by imposing fines and other administrative penalties .
But the Chinese news media rout@@ inely portra@@ y a different reality .
In January 2008 , Hu@@ bei Province inspec@@ tors beat a b@@ yst@@ ander to death after he used his cell@@ phone to film them breaking up a protest against a waste dum@@ p .
Last year , a training manual for Beijing inspec@@ tors , pil@@ fer@@ ed and posted online , described how to effectively th@@ ras@@ h offen@@ ders without drawing blood .
This year , a Shanghai water@@ mel@@ on ped@@ d@@ ler was left bra@@ in-@@ damaged after a s@@ cu@@ ff@@ le with five officers .
One viol@@ en@@ ce-@@ so@@ aked video game , available for download online , features Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ trained inspec@@ tors who ass@@ ault street vend@@ ors .
&quot; Ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an has scar@@ red the government , &quot; China Da@@ ily , a national publication , lament@@ ed last year after yet another contro@@ vers@@ y over tac@@ tics .
The paper demanded a &quot; truly thorough cle@@ an-@@ up . &quot;
Skep@@ tics say the approach here falls far short of that .
After the district adverti@@ sed for eight new female recru@@ its in October , an edi@@ torial in The Beijing E@@ ven@@ ing News ques@@ tioned whether the women had actual duties or were simply scenic di@@ versions .
The answer appears to be a little of both .
The district &apos;s adverti@@ sement called for female applicants 18 to 22 years old , with a good figure and &quot; the five fac@@ ial features in proper order . &quot;
They should be abo@@ ve-@@ average height - t@@ aller than 1.@@ 6 meters or 5 feet , 2 ½ in@@ ches .
Re@@ ti@@ rement at age 26 is mandatory .
Offici@@ als said the job was physi@@ cally too ar@@ du@@ ous for women over 25 .
&quot; Their image is the important thing , &quot; one un@@ named district official told Red@@ net@@ .com , a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ governmental Web site .
&quot; First , the candidates &apos; external qualities will determine if they make the cut , such as height , weight , fac@@ ial features , etc . &quot;
Next comes tem@@ per@@ ament and &quot; inner qualities . &quot;
F@@ em@@ ale ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an are like flower v@@ ases , he said , adding , &quot; Besides being v@@ ases , they will have other responsibilities . &quot;
Z@@ h@@ eng L@@ ih@@ ua , the dep@@ uty director of the district &apos;s city management bur@@ eau , is not e@@ ager to endorse that description .
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job adverti@@ sements for both sex@@ es .
So is the demand for or@@ derly fac@@ ial features .
Whether that means goo@@ d-@@ looking is a matter of debate among Chinese .
Certainly , the disabled or dis@@ figur@@ ed need not apply .
&quot; We can &apos;t let a l@@ ame person or a h@@ un@@ ch@@ back come to serve here , &quot; Mr. Z@@ h@@ eng said .
&quot; His image would not be good . &quot;
Li@@ u Y@@ i , who pat@@ ro@@ ls the Ba@@ o@@ gu@@ ang Square near a monastery , is 22 , app@@ le-@@ che@@ ek@@ ed with a fin@@ ely cur@@ ved mouth .
She does not consider the stress on her appearance to be sex@@ ist , she said .
&quot; Do you think I look sexy in this uniform ? &quot; she asked with a w@@ ry look .
Sa@@ id her di@@ m@@ pled co-@@ worker , 2@@ 1-@@ year-old X@@ u Y@@ ang , &quot; Our job is to present the city &apos;s image . &quot;
They do not object to their limited ten@@ ure either , they said , because they har@@ bor career ambitions greater than simply sh@@ oo@@ ing vend@@ ors into the alle@@ y@@ ways where they are supposed to con@@ fine their business .
Every morning , the squ@@ ad faces off against a do@@ zen or so ped@@ d@@ lers who dar@@ t around on foot or bicycle , trying to sell as many b@@ uns or bow@@ ls of to@@ fu as possible before they are run off .
&quot; Master W@@ ang , you have to leave . &quot;
&quot; We have told you many times ! &quot; said M@@ s. X@@ u as one vend@@ or fl@@ ed on foot , temporarily deser@@ ting his bicy@@ cle@@ -@@ drawn car@@ t of no@@ od@@ le-@@ fix@@ ings .
The officers describe their duties as more mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous than stren@@ u@@ ous .
&quot; It is pretty much the same every day , &quot; said Hu@@ ang J@@ ing , 20 , who studies marketing in her off hours .
&quot; Very routine . &quot;
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counter@@ parts to conf@@ isc@@ ate vend@@ ors &apos; goods .
They can only threaten to report viol@@ ators to their male super@@ vis@@ ors .
That tends to shi@@ eld them from the sudden public displays of anim@@ o@@ sity against offici@@ al@@ dom that are common throughout China .
This year hundreds of citizens in Kun@@ ming , the Y@@ unn@@ an provin@@ cial capital , ri@@ oted after false rum@@ ors spread that ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an officers had killed a vend@@ or .
More than a do@@ zen police or ch@@ eng@@ gu@@ an officers were injured in the night@@ time episode ; 14 government vehicles were over@@ turned or set on fire .
X@@ indu has so far escap@@ ed such violence .
But calm is hardly guaranteed .
Just two blocks from plac@@ id Ba@@ o@@ gu@@ ang Square , where the female officers pat@@ rolled that morning , more than 50 people gathered on a street corner .
Offic@@ ers had conf@@ isc@@ ated a motor@@ cycle that was being re@@ paired on the side@@ walk instead of inside a shop , as regulations require .
The bike &apos;s owner was cr@@ ying f@@ oul .
A 15-@@ minute stand@@ off en@@ su@@ ed before the officers , gri@@ m-@@ faced , el@@ b@@ owed their way to their vehicles and sp@@ ed off with the motor@@ cycle and its owner .
L@@ i X@@ u@@ ed@@ ong , 40 , a coordin@@ ator attached to the male squ@@ ad , remained behind , his white bad@@ ge fli@@ pped over to conc@@ eal his name .
Like the female officers , the coordin@@ ators - men age 40 or over - play a purely suppor@@ tive role .
Unlike them , they are not school@@ ed in maintaining a poli@@ shed image .
&quot; Sometimes we fight verb@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; Sometimes we fight physi@@ cally , &quot; Mr. L@@ i said mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; Most of the time it is the public who starts it . &quot;
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors won &apos;t charge Sen@@ ator En@@ sign
Justice Department prosec@@ ut@@ ors have clear@@ ed Sen@@ ator John En@@ sign of criminal alleg@@ ations arising from his affair with a former campaign ai@@ de and his efforts to secure lob@@ b@@ ying work for the woman &apos;s husband , the sen@@ ator &apos;s lawyers announced Wednesday .
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Mr. En@@ sign , the Nevada Republic@@ an who was considered a possible Republic@@ an presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal over his affair made national head@@ lines last year and damaged his career .
Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s office said he was &quot; certainly pleased &quot; by the decision , which followed a year@@ long investigation .
The sen@@ ator could still face disciplinary action by the Sen@@ ate ethics committee .
Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s lawyers said the Justice Department had &quot; informed us that Sen@@ ator En@@ sign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring any charges against him in this matter . &quot;
The Justice Department dec@@ lined to comment on the case .
The announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department , who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Mr. En@@ sign may have con@@ spired to viol@@ ate a criminal ban on federal lob@@ b@@ ying .
Inter@@ views , e-mail and other documents first disclos@@ ed in October 2009 in The New York Times indicated that Mr. En@@ sign had helped Dou@@ glas Hamp@@ ton , who was one of his ai@@ des , secure lu@@ cr@@ ative lob@@ b@@ ying work to win the silence of Mr. Hamp@@ ton and his wife , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia , about the sen@@ ator &apos;s affair with her .
Mr@@ s. Hamp@@ ton once served as treas@@ urer of an En@@ sign campaign .
Mr. En@@ sign cont@@ acted a number of political back@@ ers to find work for Mr. Hamp@@ ton and then advoc@@ ated on their behalf after they had hi@@ red Mr. Hamp@@ ton to lobby for them , according to the documents and interviews .
Because Mr. Hamp@@ ton had recently been an ai@@ de to Mr. En@@ sign , he was bar@@ red by law from lob@@ b@@ ying his former employ@@ er or the Sen@@ ate as a whole for a year .
Eth@@ ics experts said the unusual arrangement between Mr. En@@ sign and Mr. Hamp@@ ton , who were close friends before the affair , appeared at odds with the so-called revol@@ ving door lob@@ b@@ ying ban .
From the evidence that has been made public , &quot; there appeared to be a pri@@ ma fac@@ ie case of a con@@ spi@@ racy to viol@@ ate , and substantial violation of the revol@@ ving door statute , &quot; said Stan@@ ley Brand , a Washington lawyer who speci@@ alizes in defending clients investigated by the government .
While Justice Department officials dec@@ lined to explain the reason@@ ing behind the decision in the En@@ sign case , Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared war@@ y of taking on political prosec@@ utions after a number of high-@@ profile set@@ backs for its public integrity section , including the decision last year to drop the prosec@@ ution against former Sen@@ ator T@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens amid charges of prosec@@ ut@@ orial mis@@ conduct .
Federal prosec@@ ut@@ ors &quot; are clearly gun sh@@ y , &quot; said Mel@@ an@@ ie Slo@@ an , the executive director of Citizens for Respon@@ sibility and Eth@@ ics in Washington , an advoc@@ acy group that brought several complaints against Mr. En@@ sign in the case .
&quot; This basically says high-@@ ranking government officials can now assume the laws don &apos;t apply to them , &quot; she added .
Paul C@@ og@@ g@@ ins , Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s lead lawyer , said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosec@@ utor on Monday and a follow-up the next day , telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client .
Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s defense team had been co@@ operating with prosec@@ ut@@ ors in trying to persuade them that the sen@@ ator , as his office reiter@@ ated in a statement Wednesday , &quot; acted in accordance with the law . &quot;
Mr. C@@ og@@ g@@ ins dec@@ lined to spell out the legal arguments he made to prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
&quot; I &apos;m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except to say that we think they made the right decision , &quot; he said .
Last month , the Federal El@@ ection Commission decided to drop an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group alleg@@ ing that a $ 9@@ 6@@ ,000 payment from Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s parents to the Hamp@@ tons violated federal election law .
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was anything except a gift .
One company for which Mr. En@@ sign helped Mr. Hamp@@ ton find lob@@ b@@ ying work was N@@ V Energy , a major Nevada company that had long supported the sen@@ ator .
One e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company brought Mr. Hamp@@ ton on as a lob@@ by@@ ist , Mr. En@@ sign &apos;s chief of staff , John L@@ op@@ ez , communic@@ ated with Mr. Hamp@@ ton and told him that he was &quot; po@@ und@@ ing &quot; the Inter@@ ior Department over an issue in dispute .
Mr. En@@ sign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hamp@@ ton and another Nevada client , Al@@ legi@@ ant Air , and called the transportation secret@@ ary to set up a meeting on the airline &apos;s behalf after it had hi@@ red Mr. Hamp@@ ton to do lob@@ b@@ ying work .
When news of the affair first sur@@ faced last year , Mr. En@@ sign ap@@ ologi@@ zed to his constitu@@ ents and resign@@ ed his position as the four@@ th-@@ ranking Republic@@ an leader in the Sen@@ ate .
After keeping a low profile for many months , Mr. En@@ sign told re@@ por@@ ters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Sen@@ ate .
In announc@@ ing that Mr. En@@ sign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation , his spo@@ kes@@ woman , J@@ enni@@ fer Co@@ oper , said the sen@@ ator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department &apos;s lead and end its inquiry .
&quot; Sen@@ ator En@@ sign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada , &quot; she said .

On Thursday , the widely followed trial of St@@ even J. Hay@@ es , who was convic@@ ted of killing three members of a Ch@@ es@@ hire , Con@@ n . , family , is set to come to an official end with the judge &apos;s im@@ position of the death sentence voted for by the jury .
But lawyers for Mr. Hay@@ es have already made court fil@@ ings that sk@@ etch out appe@@ als arguments that are likely to occup@@ y the courts for years .
One of the most pro@@ voc@@ ative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstre@@ am re@@ por@@ ters &apos; extensive use of Twitter - created a &quot; cir@@ cus atmosphere &quot; and such widespread , instant sat@@ ur@@ ation with infl@@ amm@@ atory details that the jury was impro@@ per@@ ly sw@@ ayed by public pas@@ sions .
The claim could force appe@@ als judges to gra@@ pp@@ le with the question of whether new technology requires new cour@@ tro@@ om rules .
&quot; As I experienced it during this trial , I think there &apos;s a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the cour@@ tro@@ om is affecting an individual &apos;s fair@@ -@@ trial rights , &quot; said Thomas J. U@@ ll@@ mann , Mr. Hay@@ es &apos;s chief defense lawyer .
The trial judge , J@@ on C. Blue of State Superior Court , ter@@ sely rejected the claims in a ruling last week , saying that the news media were &quot; carefully controlled &quot; and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .
But that is not likely to be the last word on the issue .
For decades , appe@@ als courts have recognized that coverage of not@@ orious cases can raise questions about a trial &apos;s fair@@ ness .
In a land@@ mark 1966 ruling , the United States Supreme Court over@@ turned the conviction of a Cle@@ vel@@ and o@@ ste@@ op@@ ath , Dr. S@@ am Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d , for the murder of his wife , saying in its decision , Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d v. Max@@ well , that there was a &quot; car@@ ni@@ val atmosphere at trial &quot; because of the news media .
The crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie &quot; The Fu@@ gi@@ tive . &quot;
Some lawyers said appe@@ als courts re@@ viewing Mr. Hay@@ es &apos;s conviction half a century later might be in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by the argument that new rules could be necessary to go@@ vern ways of communic@@ ating from cour@@ tro@@ oms uni@@ mag@@ ined at the time of Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d &apos;s case .
&quot; There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media &quot; in high-@@ profile trials , said John J. Don@@ oh@@ ue III , a Stan@@ ford Law School professor who studied the Connec@@ tic@@ ut death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitr@@ arily enforced .
Professor Don@@ oh@@ ue said some appe@@ als judges might be in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by the idea that limiting instant communication from cour@@ tro@@ oms might make trials fairer .
The Twitter issue is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hay@@ es &apos;s lawyers that are likely to be argued for years , del@@ aying an execution .
The defense lawyers also claim , for example , that Mr. Hay@@ es may have been prejudi@@ ced when Ju@@ dge Blue dec@@ lined to allow them to test potential jur@@ ors &apos; reactions by showing them gr@@ is@@ ly cri@@ me@@ -@@ scene photographs during jury selection .
Some of the jur@@ ors have said they were hor@@ ri@@ fied by the photographs of the victims , J@@ enni@@ fer Ha@@ w@@ ke-@@ Peti@@ t , 48 , and her dau@@ gh@@ ters , Hay@@ ley , 17 , and Mich@@ a@@ ela , 11 .
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitu@@ tionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wron@@ g@@ ly removed a jur@@ or who had been critical of prosec@@ ut@@ ors and that he impro@@ per@@ ly added pressure for a ver@@ dict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliber@@ ate over a weekend .
The jur@@ ors were not se@@ ques@@ tered .
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest .
They noted in a challenge to the ver@@ dict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connec@@ tic@@ ut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for govern@@ or and the United States Sen@@ ate .
They argued that the news media continually f@@ ann@@ ed the fl@@ ames of emo@@ tion about the case .
&quot; The daily cr@@ ush of media t@@ we@@ ets , cameras and re@@ por@@ ters outside the cour@@ thouse , &quot; the lawyers wrote , &quot; was unlike anything ever seen here in New Hav@@ en and maybe stat@@ e@@ wide . &quot;
Their focus on the Twitter coverage is controversial .
In interviews , some journalists said the claim that instant news was more inc@@ endi@@ ary than reports delivered more slowly was a Lud@@ di@@ te view that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials .
But some lawyers said appe@@ als courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts .
Mr. Hay@@ es &apos;s lawyers are pressing that claim .
In their fil@@ ing , they referred to the Supreme Court &apos;s 1966 decision over@@ turning Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d &apos;s conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media required new rules .
&quot; This case , &quot; they wrote , &quot; represents the Sh@@ ep@@ par@@ d v. Max@@ well of the 21st century . &quot;
Can civili@@ ty bridge the divide ?
After a campaign notable for inv@@ ective and neg@@ ativity , a mo@@ dic@@ um of civili@@ ty has broken out in Washington this week .
Is it a har@@ b@@ inger of genuine bi@@ parti@@ san cooperation ahead or an ill@@ us@@ ory moment before a quick return to parti@@ san combat in the capital ?
Tuesday &apos;s meeting between President Obama and con@@ gres@@ sional leaders produced no break@@ throu@@ ghs on the big issues that must be dealt with during the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k session .
But by all accounts , it was at least a polite discussion of the two sides &apos; differences as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to go@@ vern , rather than another empty episode of parti@@ san point sc@@ oring .
Wednesday &apos;s public meeting of the president &apos;s deficit commission was equally civili@@ zed , despite the policy differences that remain among the members .
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months produced a mutual respect that tran@@ sc@@ ends the ideological gul@@ f that still separ@@ ates the members .
That &apos;s hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived .
Both sides are now in a period of testing - prob@@ ing one another for signs of co@@ oper@@ ati@@ veness and compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voters &apos; pati@@ ence for renewed parti@@ san war@@ fare .
Which is why the meeting on Tuesday and the participants &apos; reviews of it after@@ ward were done with a minimum of demands or accus@@ ations .
The philosophi@@ cal differences between Obama and the Republic@@ ans are too large and too deeply held to suggest any quick change in the climate that existed during the past two years .
Whether the issue is taxes , spending , health care or enti@@ t@@ lements , the two sides remain miles apart .
Still , the November election has tem@@ pered Washington , at least in the short term .
&quot; There &apos;s no question that ton@@ ally things have changed , &quot; said P@@ ete W@@ eh@@ ner , a Bush administration official now with the Eth@@ ics and Public Policy Center .
&quot; Those are inevitable after elections .
El@@ ections ar@@ ouse parti@@ san pas@@ sions , and then they die down .
That is good . &quot;
On some issues , particularly those on the agenda for the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k session , Republic@@ ans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution .
The Bush tax cuts exp@@ ire at the end of the year , and nobody favor@@ s that .
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them , permanently or temporarily .
Similarly , compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits , if only because Republic@@ ans can &apos;t afford to look like they favor tax cuts for the weal@@ thy while den@@ ying j@@ ob@@ less workers unemployment compensation .
After Tuesday &apos;s meeting at the White House , there is greater optim@@ ism for a possible deal on these issues during the l@@ ame duc@@ k session , along with ratification of the New ST@@ ART pact .
But William Gal@@ ston of the Bro@@ ok@@ ings Institution cau@@ tions that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the lam@@ e-@@ duc@@ k session will not necessarily lead to continued bi@@ parti@@ san@@ ship when the new 1@@ 12th Congress conven@@ es in January .
Instead , he said , a period of dis@@ agreement is likely , even inevitable .
&quot; After things that have to get done get done , the psych@@ ology in the short term will rever@@ t to one of confron@@ tation , &quot; he said .
W@@ eh@@ ner , too , expressed skep@@ ticism - which is widely shared - that civili@@ ty will lead to real cooperation .
&quot; I view most of what happens between now and 2012 as an under@@ card , or shadow box@@ ing , to the main event in 2012 , &quot; he said .
The reasons have much to do with the ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p of the new Republic@@ an majority in the House and the tea party voters who were instru@@ mental in creating it .
However min@@ d@@ ful Republic@@ an leaders are of the dangers of over@@ playing their hand , they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut government spending and repe@@ al the new heal@@ th-@@ care law .
Those parti@@ san lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission recommendations , which include reform@@ ing the tax code and raising some taxes , raising the retirement age and cutting spending .
Co-@@ chairs Alan Simp@@ son and Er@@ sk@@ ine Bow@@ les have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have , in their own estim@@ ation , forced the issue of the deficit onto the public agenda in ways that can &apos;t be ignored .
But they need 14 votes on the 18-@@ member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation , and they have been stru@@ ggling to get anywhere close to that number .
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel , suggest@@ ing that on fiscal issues there is , today at least , little grounds for or desire for compromise .
Gal@@ ston predic@@ ts two phases in the batt@@ les between the White House and con@@ gres@@ sional Republic@@ ans .
The first will come next year in the form of parti@@ san c@@ las@@ hes , as Republic@@ ans challenge Obama on the budget , taxes and health care , followed later by a period of greater bi@@ parti@@ san cooperation .
What would cause the shift ?
Public opinion .
There is considerable evidence that , despite the parti@@ san@@ ship of the recent election , a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together .
If confron@@ tation leads to stal@@ em@@ ate , as it did in 1995 , then both parties will be carefully watching the public reaction .
W@@ ho@@ ever is judged to be losing is likely to shift course and seek compromise .
That , however , may be an optimistic view .
Parti@@ san@@ ship and pol@@ ari@@ zation are greater today than they were in the mid-@@ 1990s , and there appears to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and con@@ gres@@ sional Republic@@ ans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republic@@ ans then .
At the same time , activists in both parties see 2010 as mere prel@@ ude to a more consequ@@ ential election in 2012 .
Given that reality , the civili@@ ty on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans .
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them .
Le@@ aked U.S. document portra@@ ys Moscow as haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a &quot; kle@@ p@@ to@@ c@@ racy , &quot; and it passes on a portion of the bri@@ bes and protection money it coll@@ ects all the way to the Krem@@ lin , the U.S. Em@@ bass@@ y in Russia reported in a mem@@ o in February .
Both the police and the Federal Security Service run huge protection ra@@ ckets that help account for the high cost of living in Moscow , it said .
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but from organized criminal groups as well .
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister V@@ ladimir Putin has ter@@ med the &quot; vertical of authority &quot; - takes its cut as the money moves up the lad@@ der .
The mem@@ o , which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambass@@ ador John Be@@ yr@@ le , was posted by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks on its Web site Wednesday .
The mem@@ o is based on sources whose names have been red@@ acted .
It was written while Y@@ ur@@ i Lu@@ zh@@ ko@@ v was still Moscow &apos;s may@@ or , and it bl@@ ames him for much of the corruption .
He was fi@@ red in October by President D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev , but there has been little evidence of a clean@@ up since then .
Lu@@ zh@@ ko@@ v and his wife , Y@@ el@@ ena B@@ atur@@ ina , who owns a prominent construction firm , have consistently denied corruption accus@@ ations over the years , and he has won several li@@ bel suits over such accus@@ ations .
In September he told a Russian television station , when asked about a documentary suggest@@ ing he was cor@@ rupt : &quot; It is mad , it is fil@@ th , it is a m@@ ess . &quot;
Russians overwhel@@ m@@ ingly believe that thei@@ rs is a cor@@ rupt society , poll@@ s have shown .
But it is unusual to find the partic@@ ul@@ ars sp@@ elled out as they were in the emb@@ ass@@ y &apos;s report , and it is un@@ heard of that it should be diplom@@ ats from a foreign country doing so .
&quot; The Moscow city government &apos;s direct links to crimin@@ ality have led some to call it &apos; d@@ ys@@ functional , &apos; and to asser@@ t that the government operates more as a kle@@ p@@ to@@ c@@ racy than a government , &quot; the mem@@ o says .
&quot; Criminal elements enjoy a &apos; kr@@ y@@ sh@@ a &apos; ( a term from the criminal / ma@@ fia world literally meaning &apos; roof &apos; or protection ) that runs through the police , the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ministry of Internal Affairs ( M@@ V@@ D ) , and the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office , as well as throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy .
&quot; An@@ alyst@@ s identify a three-@@ ti@@ ered structure in Moscow &apos;s criminal world . &quot;
&quot; Lu@@ zh@@ ko@@ v is at the top . &quot;
&quot; The FS@@ B , M@@ V@@ D and mili@@ tia are at the second level . &quot;
&quot; Finally , ordinary criminals and cor@@ rupt inspec@@ tors are at the lowest level . &quot;
&quot; This is an in@@ efficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city is not providing some services . &quot;
The report says that the FS@@ B ra@@ kes in money from the biggest firms , and that the police target small businesses .
One source , it said , &quot; explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the M@@ V@@ D and FS@@ B ( rather than organized crime groups ) since they not only have more g@@ uns , resources , and power than criminal groups , but they are also protected by the law . &quot;
&quot; For this reason , protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand . &quot;
The mem@@ o notes that , while the collection of money is comprehensive , the protection itself can be spot@@ ty ; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest .
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses shut down on one pretext or another .
Med@@ ve@@ dev has talked several times about fighting corruption but has admitted that he has made little head@@ way .
The emb@@ ass@@ y mem@@ o rel@@ ays reports of men taking su@@ it@@ cases , presum@@ ably stu@@ ff@@ ed with cash , into the Krem@@ lin itself .
&quot; In his fight against corruption , Med@@ ve@@ dev has to rely on bure@@ au@@ cr@@ ats , &quot; Geor@@ gy Sat@@ aro@@ v , director of the Moscow think tank Indem , said in a recent interview .
&quot; But he is a part of this bureaucracy . &quot;
&quot; He is not part of a political class , because a political class doesn &apos;t exist in Russia anymore . &quot;
Without politics , without an opposition , without a separation of powers , he said , corruption is inevitable .
Nation@@ wide , Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $ 300 billion a year .
The country was ran@@ ked 15@@ 4th in a recent survey on global perc@@ ep@@ tions of corruption by the non@@ governmental organization Transpar@@ ency International ( countries are ran@@ ked from least to most cor@@ rupt ) .
The disclos@@ ure of the U.S. Em@@ bass@@ y mem@@ o , which didn &apos;t occur until late evening Moscow time , is sure to sti@@ r disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure within the Russian government , although to the extent that Lu@@ zh@@ ko@@ v can be bl@@ amed for Moscow &apos;s fail@@ ings , it might be an opportunity for the Krem@@ lin to argue that it is solving the problem .
Inter@@ viewed for CN@@ N by Lar@@ ry King , Putin suggested that the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks documents may be fabri@@ c@@ ations and re@@ acted ang@@ ri@@ ly to a disclos@@ ure that U.S. diplom@@ ats had called him Bat@@ man to Med@@ ve@@ dev &apos;s Rob@@ in .
&quot; The truth of the matter is , this is about our interaction , which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country , &quot; he said .
&quot; But to be honest with you , we didn &apos;t suspect that this would be done with such arro@@ gan@@ ce , with such a push and , you know , being so un@@ eth@@ ically done . &quot;
Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge veter@@ ans forced to confront the past
In a di@@ mly ligh@@ ted concrete class@@ room with smu@@ dged and pe@@ eling walls , the principal of An@@ long Ven@@ g High School rec@@ alled the man who had built it , the late Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge leader T@@ a Mo@@ k .
&quot; Everyone here lo@@ ves T@@ a Mo@@ k . &quot;
&quot; He was a good leader , and he car@@ ed about his people , &quot; said S@@ ren@@ g K@@ or M@@ a , 42 .
Know@@ n as &quot; the But@@ cher &quot; for his brut@@ ality during Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge rule , the comm@@ ander remains popular in this remote former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge stron@@ gh@@ old in nor@@ th@@ western Cambo@@ dia , where he built hospitals , bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of the organization &apos;s former soldiers still live .
But this year , 12 years after the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge sur@@ rendered to the government , long-@@ held loy@@ alties are finally being challeng@@ ed in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
In April , a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime .
In June , the government distributed a high school text@@ book here that for the first time te@@ aches the history of the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge to the children of its former soldiers .
And in July , a joint U.@@ N@@ . and Cambo@@ dian tri@@ bunal handed down its first conviction of a former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge member , sent@@ encing the one@@ time chief of the not@@ orious Tu@@ ol S@@ len@@ g torture center , Ka@@ ing K@@ he@@ k I@@ ev , better known as Du@@ ch , to 35 years in prison .
With each of those developments , anx@@ i@@ ety has grown among An@@ long Ven@@ g &apos;s Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge veter@@ ans , complic@@ ating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to re@@ integrate into Cambo@@ dian society .
&quot; There is res@@ ent@@ ment and fear among the former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge , but they are power@@ less to do anything , &quot; said Ch@@ hang You@@ k , head of the Docum@@ entation Center of Cambo@@ dia , an independent organization that resear@@ ches the regime .
&quot; For them , life under the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge was gl@@ orious , but the regime has become symbolic of evil . &quot;
&quot; It is creating divisions within families . &quot;
During the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge rule of Cambo@@ dia , from 1975 until 1979 , an estimated 1.@@ 7 million people were executed or died from star@@ vation , disease or over@@ work .
When the Vietnam@@ ese inv@@ aded and top@@ pled the Po@@ l Pot@@ -@@ led government in 1979 , rem@@ n@@ ants of the regime and its military fl@@ ed to Cambo@@ dia &apos;s border with Thailand .
There they launched an ins@@ urgency that end@@ ured until the last of the movement sur@@ rendered in December 1998 .
As Po@@ l Po@@ t , Nu@@ on Ch@@ ea and I@@ eng S@@ ary directed the gu@@ er@@ ri@@ lla war from their bases in western Cambo@@ dia &apos;s mountains and jung@@ les , T@@ a Mo@@ k cultiv@@ ated a following in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
But in the mid-@@ 1990s , after a U.@@ N@@ .@@ -@@ sponsor@@ ed peace agreement led to the country &apos;s first democratic elections in 1993 , large groups of Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge figh@@ ters began def@@ ecting to the government , cul@@ min@@ ating in the sur@@ ren@@ ders of I@@ eng S@@ ary in 1996 and Nu@@ on Ch@@ ea and K@@ hi@@ eu S@@ amp@@ han in 1998 .
Po@@ l Po@@ t died of natural causes in 1998 , and T@@ a Mo@@ k , who had held out , was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dan@@ gre@@ k Mountains .
He died in a Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h prison in 2006 while awaiting trial .
With their benef@@ actors no longer providing for them , most former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge figh@@ ters have desc@@ ended into the gr@@ in@@ ding poverty common in rural Cambo@@ dia , and many remain no@@ st@@ alg@@ ic for the movement .
Although a few elite Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge officials kept their local government posts in exchange for laying down their arms , the rank and file remain poor , uns@@ killed farmers .
&quot; These people have benef@@ ited very little following the sur@@ render , &quot; said So@@ k Le@@ ang of the Center for Justice and Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation , which holds public forums throughout Cambo@@ dia , including in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
&quot; They are embedded with the ut@@ op@@ ian agr@@ arian ideology of the regime . &quot;
&quot; They were brought up with no concept of doing business . &quot;
S@@ or L@@ im , 55 , who joined the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge as a teen@@ ager in 1974 , fought in the jung@@ le around An@@ long Ven@@ g before sett@@ ling down to life as a poor rice far@@ mer in 1998 .
&quot; Life under the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge was good , &quot; he said .
&quot; T@@ a Mo@@ k fed everyone . &quot;
&quot; But now , life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves . &quot;
The ongoing Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge tri@@ bunal has also prov@@ oked wor@@ ries here .
Early next year , the court is expected to begin trying Nu@@ on Ch@@ ea , K@@ hi@@ eu S@@ amp@@ han , I@@ eng S@@ ary and his wife , I@@ eng Th@@ iri@@ th , another former Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge minister .
The court &apos;s mandate is to prosec@@ ute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes , but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four .
This has done little to calm fears in An@@ long Ven@@ g .
Rec@@ ent media speculation has cent@@ ered on Im Cha@@ em , 64 , who was a district chief in B@@ ant@@ e@@ ay Me@@ anch@@ ey province during Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge rule in the late 1970s .
In 2007 , she told researchers from the Docum@@ entation Center of Cambo@@ dia that she had super@@ vised construction of the Tra@@ pe@@ ang Th@@ ma dam , a project in which thousands of forced labor@@ ers are thought to have died .
On a s@@ wel@@ tering recent evening , Im Cha@@ em returned from working in the fields to her wooden sti@@ lt house on a di@@ rt road outside An@@ long Ven@@ g .
As the sun cast long shad@@ ows across the par@@ ched grass , Im Cha@@ em dec@@ lined to discuss her past in the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge .
If the court sum@@ mon@@ ed her , she said , she would refuse to go .
&quot; Cambo@@ dia is at peace and stable , &quot; she said .
&quot; If there are more prosec@@ utions , there will be war . &quot;
Prime Minister H@@ un S@@ en , who def@@ ected from the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge in 1978 , has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court pursu@@ es more susp@@ ects , although experts and hist@@ ori@@ ans dispute that .
&quot; Cambo@@ dia must dig a hole and bury the past , &quot; he has said .
But confron@@ ting the past is just what Cambo@@ dia must do to move forward , said Ch@@ hang You@@ k , of the documentation center .
&quot; Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation in Kh@@ mer terms is re@@ connecting the broken pieces , &quot; he said .
&quot; It &apos;s our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand . &quot;
The center produced the first govern@@ ment-@@ approved text@@ book about the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge , the 7@@ 5-@@ page &quot; A History of Democratic Kamp@@ u@@ che@@ a . &quot;
It distributed it in An@@ long Ven@@ g in June as a supplement to the Education Ministry &apos;s high school history text@@ book , which contains fewer than four pages about the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge .
As in much of Cambo@@ dia , An@@ long Ven@@ g &apos;s young people know few details about the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge , despite the town &apos;s connection to the regime .
Touch Val@@ e@@ ak , 19 , a student at An@@ long Ven@@ g High School , said the new text@@ book was helping students understand an important part of their history .
But his parents re@@ acted with skep@@ ticism when he took the book home to study .
&quot; My family re@@ jects many parts of the text@@ book and the tri@@ bunal , &quot; he said .
&quot; They are susp@@ icious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosec@@ ute . &quot;
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult , So@@ k Le@@ ang said .
But the public forums , the text@@ book and the tri@@ bunal are beginning to have an impact , he said .
Still , the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge re@@ tains a powerful all@@ ure here .
Up in the Dan@@ gre@@ k Mountains , a path over@@ grown with we@@ eds and stre@@ wn with dis@@ car@@ ded plastic bags leads to a rec@@ t@@ angle of black so@@ ot covered by a ru@@ sted tin roof .
Po@@ l Po@@ t &apos;s body was bur@@ ned here on a pi@@ le of ti@@ res after his death in 1998 .
Nu@@ om So@@ the@@ a , 31 , a road@@ side cell@@ phone vend@@ or , said she didn &apos;t know much about the man who was cre@@ m@@ ated there .
&quot; But he has a strong spirit , and many local people go there to pra@@ y to him , &quot; she said .
It was Nu@@ om So@@ the@@ a &apos;s birthday , and later that day she planned to walk to Po@@ l Po@@ t &apos;s final res@@ ting place , where she would leave a b@@ unch of ri@@ pe ban@@ anas in hopes of bringing good luck .
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium
In a surprise victory for President Obama &apos;s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide , the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stock of highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium , a critical component of nuclear weapons .
The deal was disclos@@ ed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Ro@@ d@@ ham Clinton met with Belar@@ us@@ an Foreign Minister S@@ erg@@ ei Mar@@ ty@@ no@@ v on the si@@ delines of a security summit here .
The U.S. government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium and seemed to have hit a road@@ block last spring .
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 18@@ 7 po@@ unds of weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium from a Belar@@ us@@ an research facility .
That set the stage for Wednesday &apos;s agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 po@@ unds &apos; worth , according to one official , who spoke on the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity because of the sensitivity of the matter .
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of Obama &apos;s 4@@ 7-@@ nation Nuclear Security Summit in April , which excluded Belarus .
And it was apparently good enough to secure the former Soviet re@@ public &apos;s invitation to the follow-up summit , in 2012 .
&quot; I was really fascin@@ ated by the fact they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit . &quot;
&quot; That proves to me this process is working , &quot; said K@@ en Lu@@ on@@ go , president of the Partnership for Global Security , a group promoting nuclear security .
Clinton called the agreement &quot; a very significant , important step &quot; by Belarus .
Obama ple@@ dged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years .
Since then , the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium .
Belarus would be the s@@ eventh .
A do@@ zen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration .
At the time of Obama &apos;s Nuclear Security Summit , Belar@@ us@@ an President Alexander Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko had declared that the nation would never give up its ur@@ anium .
&quot; We have kept highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium - hundreds of ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of what is basically weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade and lower@@ -@@ enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium , &quot; Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko said then .
&quot; This is our commodity ... We are not going to make dirty bom@@ bs , and we are not going to sell it to anybody . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re using it for research purposes , is all . &quot;
Belarus appro@@ ached the United States a few months ago , however , indicating interest in reaching an agreement .
The first undertaking to remove Belarus &apos;s ur@@ anium , in October , was especially complicated because the material had been slightly ir@@ radi@@ ated , officials said .
It was loaded onto a special train that travel@@ ed more than 1,@@ 300 miles to a Russian facility for storage and disposal , officials said .
The second operation concluded Monday and was done by plane , according to the officials .
The U.S. government spent $ 13 million on the efforts , much of it to supply Belarus &apos;s research facility with low-@@ enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium , which is not suitable for nuclear weapons .
&quot; This was very carefully coordinated and or@@ chest@@ rated to build up the trust &quot; that led to the agreement signed by Clinton , said Andrew Bi@@ eni@@ aw@@ ski , an Energy Department official working on Global Th@@ re@@ at Re@@ duction .
The James Martin Center for Non@@ proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 88 po@@ unds of weap@@ on@@ s-@@ grade ur@@ anium , as well as hundreds of po@@ unds of highly enrich@@ ed ur@@ anium .
Belarus will aim to eliminate its stock@@ pi@@ le by 2012 , according to the joint statement .
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been stra@@ ined for years , primarily because of Lu@@ k@@ ash@@ enko &apos;s harsh repression of human rights .
But Wednesday &apos;s statement suggested a potential th@@ a@@ wing .
&quot; Wel@@ coming progress on these global security issues , the United States and Belarus acknowledged that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations , and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens , &quot; it said .
The Spanish Government did not raise objections regarding the flights of CIA
The Spanish Government did not raise objections regarding the flights of CIA with Taliban prisoners and of Al Q@@ a@@ eda that were going to Guantánamo via Spanish territory , according to the the USA amb@@ ass@@ ador in Madrid &apos;s tel@@ eg@@ ram .
Thus is reflected through the fil@@ tered documents ( c@@ ables ) by Wiki@@ le@@ aks to the newspaper El Pa@@ í@@ s , where it is added that the first vic@@ e-@@ president of the Government at that time , Maria Ter@@ esa Fern@@ an@@ dez of the V@@ ega , asked that the Spanish Executive was informed in order &quot; to be able to demonstrate that they had carried out appropriate monitoring procedures on the foreign aircraft that cross Spain . &quot;
In June 2006 , after a report of the European Council where there were accus@@ ations of complic@@ ity in practices against human rights in a do@@ zen countries , among which is Spain , a meeting took place between the ex@@ - North American amb@@ ass@@ ador E@@ du@@ ardo A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re and Fern@@ an@@ dez de la V@@ ega .
The vic@@ e-@@ president recognized that the council &apos;s report &quot; had taken the Government of Zap@@ ater@@ o outside the game &quot; and insi@@ sted that Spain did not have anything to hide regarding this matter .
&quot; De la V@@ ega empha@@ sized that Spain does not raise obj@@ ection for the intelligence flights over Spanish territory . &quot;
&quot; They simply want to be informed &quot; in order to avoid being &quot; caught by surprise , &quot; A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re relates in a tel@@ eg@@ ram .
Also the ex-@@ Minister of External Affairs , Miguel Ang@@ el Mor@@ at@@ inos , indicated to the amb@@ ass@@ ador that the Spanish Executive &quot; wanted to give this issue as little attention as possible , although being in the hands of the judges , the Government had a limited influence . &quot;
On the other hand , in January 2007 , the public prosec@@ utor Vic@@ ente Gonz@@ á@@ lez transmitted to the Em@@ bass@@ y that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge of requesting the dec@@ lassi@@ fication of documents of the National Center of Intelli@@ gence ( CN@@ I ) and of the mini@@ stry of Def@@ ense regarding the flights of the company &quot;
This information does not contain any inc@@ ri@@ min@@ atory element nor any sensitive information , &quot; explained the Em@@ bass@@ y after speaking with the public prosec@@ utor .
Nevertheless , the USA reflected on its pre@@ occupation for &quot; the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , &quot; more than the dec@@ lassi@@ fied information of the CN@@ I or the mini@@ stry of Def@@ ense .
&quot; This coordination between independent investig@@ ators will complic@@ ate our efforts to handle discre@@ et@@ ly the case between Govern@@ ments &quot; ; says A@@ gu@@ ir@@ re .
In March 2007 during a lunch between the amb@@ ass@@ ador of the USA and minister of the Internal Affairs , Al@@ fre@@ do Per@@ ez Rub@@ al@@ cab@@ a , this one comm@@ ented to him that &quot; although the Spanish judges are rab@@ idly je@@ al@@ ous of their independence and will do what they consider to be right , &quot; he had given instructions to his collabor@@ ators &quot; to avoid comm@@ ent@@ aries of infl@@ amed rhetoric , in an attempt to reduce the temperature . &quot;
The amb@@ ass@@ ador also expresses his pre@@ occupation for the action of the PP in this matter .
&quot; In spite of his pro American general orientation , our experience suggests that the PP won &apos;t doubt in cap@@ itali@@ zing any indication that the Government of Zap@@ ater@@ o toler@@ ated or deliberately ignored actions of the USA that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights , even if these re@@ vel@@ ations have negative consequences for the Government of the USA , &quot; indicates .
The par@@ ri@@ cide compl@@ ained of the the &quot; burden &quot; of being a mother
The young lady spoke of the baby when he was already dead and she kept a blog : &quot; Terror of the Galici@@ an &quot;
M@@ ó@@ nica Ju@@ an@@ at@@ ey Fern@@ an@@ dez is &quot; Mu@@ ki &quot; in the network .
With this nick@@ name , that she has used since since she was young , she communic@@ ated with a c@@ ous@@ in , and at least one friend , both of them from No@@ ia , the town of Cor@@ ua where she was born .
The messages are from 2008 .
In order to understand them , it is necessary to know the personal life that AB@@ C re@@ construc@@ ts through her relatives &apos; testim@@ oni@@ als .
The young lady from Galici@@ a , 30 years , initiated a relation in 1998 with I@@ v@@ án T@@ ú@@ ñ@@ ez , an industri@@ alist .
This affair la@@ sted one year .
They decided to split , soon after they found out that she was pregn@@ ant .
He wanted to know if the baby was his , but his ex never allowed him to take the DNA test .
So@@ on after that she found someone else .
The man she chose was was Alber@@ to , a man from Lou@@ same , a neighbor@@ ing municipality .
She remained with him for a long period of time .
Ca@@ es@@ ar lived with them .
When the girl went to the Bal@@ ear@@ ic Islands to test the labour market , the child remained with her au pair that accompanied her for one week in Palma .
But in the content of her messages , one can see that their rom@@ ance had ended , it was broken up .
In March 2008 in Men@@ orca , single , she writes : &quot; Alber@@ to is very wei@@ rd and up@@ set , because I have come here to work . &quot;
&quot; When I told him this he seemed to be happy , sure , but now he re@@ alizes how hard it is to stay with the child all day long and not to have the freedom of doing what he wants &quot; ;
Then , she speaks of a message received on her mobile phone that reads : &quot; I want you to come this month or give me an address to which I can send you the child . &quot;
She adds : &quot; If he doesn &apos;t like leaving the child with my mother , I will take him when I get back . &quot;
In May , she speaks about her return to town : &quot; I will go there this week , but I will only stay until the 19th , because on the 20th I must present myself at work . &quot;
She clari@@ fies that if everything goes well , she will keep her first-@@ born child .
&quot; From now on he will stay with whom he must stay , meaning with me and I will never in my life leave him again with somebody else except for my mother &quot; doub@@ t@@ ful intention given her bad relationships .
In July , there is another post .
When she writes it , it is assumed that the boy , who arrived at the island on the 1st of that month , and supposedly was assass@@ inated on 10th , is already dead .
&quot; Ca@@ es@@ ar is in cont@@ ented on the one hand , but not on the other hand . &quot;
On the one hand he is with me and he likes the location , but on the other hand he is going to classes almost every day . &quot;
She speaks of a transfer to Mallorca .
&quot; He will go to summer classes there , and thus I can save some money . &quot;
On the 17th , there are memories and complaints .
&quot; Hu@@ gs from Ca@@ es@@ ar , who asked me when you &apos;@@ l come back . &quot;
&quot; Alber@@ to says that he sent I do not know what videos to the email and as you can see when he wants he can find me . &quot;
On the 30@@ th , another one : &quot; The boy is well ; he goes to summer classes to learn Catal@@ an . &quot;
About Vic@@ tor , there is one : &quot; He gives me money . &quot;
On the Internet there are messages of her in blo@@ gs dedicated to animation .
She even had one of her own in My@@ Space universe , where she called herself &quot; Mu@@ ki the ex pris@@ oner . &quot;
&quot; Terror of the Galici@@ an woman ( ins@@ cription ) . &quot;
The last man , who lived with her , declar@@ es his gri@@ ef for feeling guilty .
He does not want to think that everything has happened for not having told him that she was a single mother .
M@@ ó@@ nica entered yesterday in the provin@@ cial prison of Palm , coming from the center of judicial prisoners of Men@@ orca .
Carlos Mac@@ eda , the appointed lawyer , explained that he does not remember how the facts occurred , &quot; nor that he had the intention to cause any minor pain . &quot;
Before , yes she conf@@ essed that she had dro@@ w@@ ned Ca@@ es@@ ar in the bath@@ tub and deposi@@ ted his cor@@ pse in a su@@ it@@ case .
The defence and the public prosec@@ utor asked for a psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c test .
The popular would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PS@@ C would lose 9
With the results of the 28@@ -@@ N , the PP could be decisive in the municip@@ alities of L@@ éri@@ da , Tar@@ rag@@ ona and Barcelona
After the important increase in the votes and experienced dep@@ u@@ ties in the recent autonom@@ ic elections , the Catal@@ an PP is already thinking to the general elections , is there and advance or not ? , the outlook is more than positive , since the number of votes that this formation ob@@ tains in those elections usually doub@@ les the ones received during the Catal@@ an elections .
Thus , the popular Catal@@ ans obtained 6@@ 10.@@ 4@@ 73 votes in the general elections of 2008 , whereas in the autonom@@ ic ones of 2006 , the number dropped to to 3@@ 16.@@ 2@@ 22 .
Last Sunday , the P@@ PC obtained 38@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 91 votes .
If this up@@ wards tendency ensures a transfer of votes PS@@ C votes and the loy@@ alty of the elec@@ torate of the PP . An@@ alyst@@ s of this formation have calculated that , if general elections took place , the P@@ PC could get from 8 to 12 dep@@ u@@ ties in the Congress , whereas CI@@ U would also gain four ( now it has 10 ) and the PS@@ C would lose nothing less than 9 dep@@ u@@ ties ( it has 25 ) .
These calculations would observe that the Catal@@ an area is fundamental for PP and PS@@ O@@ E .
According to the opinion poll@@ s , ER@@ C would lose a dep@@ uty - it currently has thre@@ e- whereas IC@@ V would remain with a dep@@ uty or would gain one .
But , if the electoral calendar remains established , the immediate appointment will take place in May of 2011 with the municipal elections , where the popular seats can also be decisive in the aim of the socialist he@@ gem@@ ony in the four capit@@ als of the province and their change to the front of the Delegation of Barcelona , one of the administrations that hand@@ les the biggest budget - 6@@ 61 million Euros for 20@@ 11@@ - .
Nation@@ alists &apos; as much as popular ones coinci@@ de in the possibility that the PS@@ C loses the city coun@@ cils of Barcelona , Tar@@ rag@@ ona , L@@ éri@@ da and Ger@@ ona , where the Socialists would not obtain the majority nor the possibility of appealing to their traditional partners , ER@@ C and IC@@ V .
Given the re@@ public@@ an fi@@ as@@ co , it would not be a surprise for this formation to lose its representation in the Town hall of Barcelona - it is needed to obtain 5 % of the votes .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capit@@ als and could be a decisive force in Barcelona , L@@ éri@@ da and Tar@@ rag@@ ona .
The nation@@ alists are convinced of being able to carry out the up@@ set in the capital of Tar@@ rag@@ ona , where they governed with the PP before the present socialist may@@ or , Jose@@ p Feli@@ x Ball@@ ester@@ os .
In L@@ éri@@ da , the PP has been placed only to 500 votes of the PS@@ C , whose may@@ or , Á@@ n@@ gel R@@ os , maintains very good relations with Mari@@ ano Ra@@ joy - during this last campaign , they met in several occasions .
The popular ones have also grown in other important municip@@ alities like Bad@@ al@@ ona , Castell@@ def@@ els or R@@ eus .
At the moment , the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catal@@ onia and asp@@ ires to form lists in the maximum number of populations .
The Catal@@ an group facilit@@ ated thousands of pas@@ sports to Al Q@@ ai@@ da
Besides the seven prisoners in Barcelona , in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakist@@ an@@ is and the Nig@@ eri@@ an one stopped by agents of the General Barcelona police intelligence formed a ji@@ ha@@ di@@ st group that , directed from Thailand , facilit@@ ated pas@@ sports to different groups of Al Q@@ ai@@ da , among them &quot; The T@@ ig@@ ers for the Liber@@ ation of Tam@@ il@@ m Territ@@ ory &quot; ( LT@@ TE ) and &quot; Las@@ k@@ ar and Tai@@ ba &quot; ( Let ) , author this last one of the attacks of Bom@@ bay that caused the death of 10@@ 6 people in 2008 .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has paid attention to these investigations , until the point of ass@@ uring that with &quot; Kamp@@ ai &quot; operation ; it has been &quot; weaken &quot; the appar@@ atus of fal@@ si@@ fication of Al Q@@ ai@@ da at an international level and , &quot; therefore , its operative capacity . &quot;
The investig@@ ators calcul@@ ate that the cell , during the two years that has been active in Catal@@ onia , has been able to send thousands of pas@@ sports to Thailand , where they were fal@@ si@@ fied and soon distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galax@@ y Al Q@@ ai@@ da so that its &quot; comb@@ at@@ ants &quot; can cross the European borders and the ones of other western countries with total imp@@ unity .
The dismant@@ led cell is not the only one that the ji@@ ha@@ di@@ st network had in Europe , for this reason in the investigations there have participated , besides the Thailand services , other European police units , reason why it does not disc@@ ard that in territory of the EU occur similar events to the one developed the night of Tuesday in Barcelona .
In coordination with this operation ( The Pakist@@ ani Jun@@ aid Hu@@ may@@ un , A@@ ti@@ q@@ ur Reh@@ man , J@@ ab@@ ran As@@ gh@@ ar , M@@ ali@@ k I@@ f@@ tik@@ h@@ ar Ah@@ mad , Moh@@ am@@ mad S@@ addi@@ que Kh@@ an Beg@@ um , Tan@@ ve@@ er Ar@@ s@@ had and the Nig@@ eri@@ an Bab@@ at@@ unde Ag@@ un@@ bi@@ ade were all stopped ) , in Thailand another one had developed with the capture of the Pakist@@ an@@ is Mu@@ ham@@ mad Ath@@ ar But@@ t and Ze@@ esh@@ an E@@ h@@ san But@@ t and the Thai Si@@ ri@@ kan@@ lay@@ a Ki@@ j@@ b@@ um@@ rung .
The group se@@ ated in Spain and other European countries was directed from Bang@@ cock
The Catal@@ an network - part of it was struck in 2009 - mainly rob@@ bed pas@@ sports to tourists who fulfilled the requirements marked by the call &quot; World@@ wide Islamic front . &quot;
That is to say , the documents had to be in the name of men among 25 and 45 years , with validity of several years and without printed visas .
In the means of investigation it is empha@@ sized that , for the moment , no data has been found related to the persons arrested in Catal@@ onia regarding the attack of Bom@@ bay , although the author of this attack , &quot; Las@@ k@@ ar e Tai@@ ba &quot; , has been one of the receiving groups of the pas@@ sports rob@@ bed in Spain and soon fal@@ si@@ fied in Thailand .
However , it should be mentioned that days before this committed attack , from Catal@@ onia there were sent through an agency of transfer@@ ences about some thousands of dollars that were &quot; invested &quot; in the purchase of mobile phone cards that soon were used by the members of the &quot; comm@@ ando &quot; that ended the life of 10@@ 6 people .
The Po@@ lic@@ emen have captured a lot of documentation .
The PP asks M@@ as to postp@@ one the fiscal concert
The leader of the P@@ PC , Ali@@ cia San@@ che@@ z-@@ Cam@@ ach@@ o , had yesterday was able to personally present her conditions for supporting his investi@@ ture as president of the Catal@@ an Autonom@@ ous Government to Art@@ ur M@@ as , identical to ones already raised during the campaign and that resume themselves in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and giving up ph@@ y@@ lo@@ -@@ sovereignty , as it is the economic concert that the nation@@ alist leader wants to raise in the line of his mandate .
The president of the popular Catal@@ ans went to the Art@@ ur M@@ as meeting with the security of having obtained 18 dep@@ u@@ ties in last Sunday &apos;s elections , a number more than sufficient to be assumed popular , since the candidate of Ci@@ U needs that at least one of the form@@ ations that will force the opposition to ab@@ stain in the investi@@ ture voting .
On the possible agreement with the PP depend the future alli@@ ances that the nation@@ alists want to remain in the Congress when general elections are held , but , at the moment , the convers@@ ations that M@@ as maintains with the rest of the political leaders in Catal@@ an is key .
As regards the president of the PP , for supporting an investi@@ ture &quot; she will have to make all the sovereign and independent speeches , &quot; as well as the economic concert - similar to the one of the Basque Country - that the conver@@ gent leader tries to put under referendum .
Both leaders have their gam@@ ble of using a very infl@@ ated autonom@@ ic administration and eliminating the succ@@ essions and donations tax .
Of the details of the negotiation on the investi@@ ture of which M@@ as will take care , on behalf of the P@@ PC , Jor@@ di Cor@@ net and Dol@@ ors Mont@@ ser@@ rat .
M@@ as has already met Jo@@ aqu@@ im N@@ ad@@ al ( PS@@ C ) - who promised a hard opposition , Jo@@ an Herr@@ era ( IC@@ V ) and today he will do the same with Jo@@ an Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s ( ER@@ C ) , Albert Ri@@ ver@@ a ( Ci@@ ut@@ ad@@ ans ) and Jo@@ an La@@ port@@ a ( Catal@@ an Solidar@@ it@@ at ) .
The geri@@ atri@@ cian affir@@ ms that the deaths were caused by &quot; lack of means &quot;
The owners of the center of O@@ lot do not disc@@ ard that their attend@@ ant killed more than 11 elderly people
The people in charge with the geri@@ atri@@ c hospital La Car@@ it@@ at de O@@ lot ( Ger@@ ona ) offered a press conference yesterday in order to underline the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Jo@@ an Vil@@ a Dil@@ m@@ é , the nur@@ se who while there killed at least el@@ even elderly people that he had under surveillance .
The director of the residence , Jo@@ an Sal@@ a , appeared accompanied by the centre &apos;s lawyer , lawyer Jo@@ an Canada , and announced that &quot; the intention of La Car@@ it@@ at would to pin the blame on the individual responsible for of the deaths but &quot; leg@@ ality and responsibility forces us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible people . &quot;
And that besides the social loss of pres@@ tige that the organization can encounter for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the wat@@ ch@@ man , the great threat for the Car@@ it@@ at has now takes the shape of of a substantial in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication that is already calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims .
Jo@@ an Vil@@ a Dil@@ m@@ é has conf@@ essed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that since then he didn &apos;t stop killing .
The judge already mentioned in the document that ordered the ex@@ hum@@ ation of eight bodies - old patients of the geri@@ atri@@ c hospit@@ al@@ - whom she susp@@ ected that in many cases no doctor personally expl@@ ored the dead bodies but , taking into account the age and the path@@ ologies of the patients , the procedure was made by phone .
La Car@@ it@@ at , through its director , fully denied this end yesterday and mentioned that &quot; the lack of measures couldn &apos;t have been at any moment the cause of what had happened . &quot;
The lawyer of La Car@@ it@@ at added that &quot; in the cause there is no indication that there has been an imp@@ ru@@ dent action on the part of any other person who is not the guilty one . &quot;
The one b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed as &quot; Ang@@ el of De@@ ath &quot; conf@@ essed 11 mur@@ ders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on the 29@@ th of August of 2009 and a month and a half later , killed another grand@@ mother .
In this case an over@@ dose of in@@ su@@ lin brought her the death ; unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sed@@ ative tab@@ lets .
The director of the Car@@ it@@ at says that it is complicated to control that the personnel of the center have access to medicines .
The over@@ dose of in@@ su@@ lin and the sed@@ ative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nur@@ se , in his eag@@ ern@@ ess to allevi@@ ate the suffering of the patients , used or killing them .
But the tests that are being carried out in the laboratory will have to clarify if Vil@@ a is not lying and tried to assure for his first victims a less cru@@ el death or if , on the contrary , bur@@ ned them internally by giving them ly@@ e as he already conf@@ essed that had done with the three women that he killed between the 12th and the 17th of October .
In La Car@@ it@@ at they do not give credibility to the appearance of the wat@@ ch@@ man , nor to the number of conf@@ essed mur@@ ders , that they do not refu@@ te being superior , and justi@@ fies his attitude in the different versions that Vil@@ a has given in his visits to the court and the non@@ sense of changing his method of killing after having successfully committed , eight mur@@ ders .
This is why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the reach of this event .
The B@@ CE threatens
The investors suddenly re@@ acted yesterday to the threat of T@@ rich@@ et that noticed that &quot; the markets do not have to under@@ estimate our ability to react . &quot;
The differenti@@ als of peripher@@ als have closed by force and the rates of the European banks have raised more than 5 % .
However , we do not have to under@@ estimate the capacity of the B@@ CE in being mist@@ aken and the Euro has just di@@ pped again which is a wor@@ ris@@ ome signal .
What happened yesterday is characteristic of a non liquid market that collap@@ ses and reco@@ vers but motivated by the closing of short and very spec@@ ulative positions .
The institutional investors will take time in reg@@ aining confidence .
A month ago the B@@ CE called us today to reti@@ re liquidity measures and will spend time tomorrow to reti@@ re by fourth time in two years and those that are left .
The Bundes@@ bank demanded to fin@@ alize the plan of purchase of ineffective national debt and to eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit , leaving only lim@@ it@@ less access by week .
After the Irish crisis we hoped that they pro@@ long the present measures of liquidity &quot; at least until March &quot; and maintain the quar@@ terly auction with lim@@ it@@ less access by the end of the tri@@ m@@ ester in order to guarantee the liquidity at least until June .
We also hope that they continue with their program of vou@@ chers purchase and give signs of intensi@@ fying it .
If they do not fulfil the generated expectations they will transform the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue being blin@@ ded by reti@@ ring liquidity measures , Good Lord !
As happened during the meeting of May when they affir@@ med that they had not contem@@ pl@@ ated the vou@@ chers purchase and collap@@ sed the markets , tomorrow history could repeat itself .
The B@@ CE must be credible and persistent .
In May announced the b@@ az@@ oo@@ ka on Monday and on Wednesday said that it had already bought too much , bringing about a new collapse of the market .
The auction of b@@ ills organized once a year in Portugal were very poor yesterday .
The Treas@@ ury only distributed 500 million to 5,@@ 28 % , ver@@ sus 750 million to 4.@@ 81 % of the previous auction .
Even so the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in the entire cur@@ ve , reflecting clearly a change in the market feeling after the words of T@@ rich@@ et .
In Ireland , the Al@@ lied and Bank of Ireland deficit figur@@ ed had been made public .
The considered numbers are about 10.000 million in the short term and another 15@@ .000 are potenti@@ als . Until February they have to obtain private capital or will be nation@@ alized .
Although Ireland does not have any credibility for not having detected the problem in July with the economic stress test , the numbers are acceptable within the Plan of Aid and help in reducing the level of uncertainty .
However , the next Tuesday , the Government will have to secure the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still doesn &apos;t have sufficient support , reason why Ireland continues being an uncertainty center .
Angela Merkel has moder@@ ated the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension facing the next Summit of Presidents and Government on the 14th of December where it is necessary a political commitment that could demonstrate that we are a union and that goes in the same direction .
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wag@@ ner and the rest the hy@@ m@@ n of joy of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven .
In Spain , the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the set of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Cab@@ inet .
The Re@@ formation of pensions , transparency in independent communities and financial organizations , reduction of the deficit , liberalization , privati@@ zation , measures for re@@ activ@@ ating jobs sound in the ears of the investors as the four seasons of Vi@@ val@@ di .
The double effect of T@@ rich@@ et and Z@@ P explain that the Spanish stock@@ -@@ market has raised 4,@@ 5 % , double compared to the rest of European stock@@ -@@ markets .
Unlike February , the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and for@@ ceful and we are benef@@ iting from the surprise effect .
Today there is a key auction of a vou@@ cher to three years that will be having the T@@ rich@@ et effect , reason why we hope that it will be solved with increased demand and will help dis@@ si@@ p@@ ating the doubts on our capacity of re@@ financing .
For Spain asking for a Plan of Aid would be a self sacrifice .
They would give us a line of liquidity that we did not need , the Treas@@ ure has more than 4@@ 0.000 million available in liquidity the triple compared to March , to the most expensive types and clos@@ es the access to the markets in@@ definitely .
However , the strategy must continue being the one of the woman of Ca@@ es@@ ar , &quot; besides being , looking like . &quot;
Come on , we can do it .
The president of E@@ ulen will contest the meeting of V@@ ega S@@ ic@@ ili@@ a requested by his children
The storm does not moderate the Al@@ v@@ are@@ z family conflict , propri@@ et@@ ors of E@@ ulen and El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o .
David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z , founder of the group , will oppose , by considering &quot; n@@ ull and void , &quot; the judicial meeting of En E@@ ne@@ br@@ o of the 16th , required by five of his seven children and when they try to impose their majority and take control of the management organs of the company that owns the V@@ aga S@@ ic@@ ili@@ a wareh@@ ouses .
David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z and his children Jesus David and Maria J@@ ose are taking into consideration the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their li@@ tig@@ ation for the control of part of the group .
The founder of the greatest holding company of enterprise services does not seem willing to give up in his li@@ tig@@ ation in order to be present in the control systems of El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o .
From his council of administration he was taken off by five of his seven children who appointed themselves administr@@ ators in the council of shareholders on 18th of January of this year and whose opposition is written down in the Mer@@ can@@ tile Regi@@ stry .
The judicial meeting of El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o arranged for the 16th , sum@@ mon@@ ed by the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate of Mer@@ can@@ tile Affairs Num@@ ber 2 of Madrid , has caused ha@@ vo@@ c yet again in the Al@@ v@@ are@@ z family .
The appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is , until the conflict is solved , the single legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting &apos;s convention .
The last actions of Juan Carlos , P@@ ab@@ lo , Em@@ ili@@ o , Mar@@ ta and El@@ vi@@ ra Al@@ v@@ are@@ z Me@@ z@@ qui@@ ri@@ z , is described by David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z as a &quot; desper@@ ate appeal by the representatives of his five children who , by means of procedural sub@@ t@@ l@@ ety , clearly infr@@ ing@@ ing the Law and ab@@ using the right , try to confirm and change the meeting of the 18th of January as n@@ ull , &quot; according to his official spo@@ kes@@ men .
This argum@@ entation will be the basis on which to establish that : once the meeting has been held , he will reject considering it &quot; n@@ ull and void . &quot;
The same prot@@ agon@@ ists , who maintain a discre@@ et silence , have already tried without success to have the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate summ@@ on a meeting in June .
In El E@@ ne@@ br@@ o , patri@@ mon@@ ial society holder of the War@@ eh@@ ouses V@@ ega S@@ ic@@ ili@@ a , among others assets , the seven children of David Al@@ v@@ are@@ z control the 100 % of the capital .
The founder of the service group claims , nevertheless , the us@@ u@@ fru@@ ct on 51 % of the capital , according to the familiar protocols .
This subject is the basic aspect that has to be decided by the judge once celebrated the meeting on the demand of opposition , for which the date is no indicated yet .
Red Bul@@ l tri@@ um@@ phs in F@@ 1 with its secret weapon : Siemens .
There is software that can design improvements to the cars in real time .
Since Red Bul@@ l entered the world of Formul@@ a 1 in 2004 , its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success .
Initi@@ ally nobody considered the options of a team that just arrived , in spite of the as@@ c@@ ending tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory of the last seasons , last November , in the final race of the champ@@ ionship all bet on the tri@@ umph of Fern@@ ando Al@@ on@@ so &apos;s Ferrari .
Without losing part of his reputation as champion driver , the German Sebastian V@@ ett@@ el , nor the power of the Ren@@ ault motor that drives his car , in the world of Formul@@ a 1 &quot; the secret weapon that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bul@@ l in order to turn it into a winning team has become a legend .
In fact it is powerful simulation software that the German company mark@@ eted in 2007 with aims very far away from the high automobile competition .
Den@@ omin@@ ated PL@@ M , this powerful computer science instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories , energy plants , instruments of high precision .
The objective is to re@@ produce , to fai@@ th@@ fully simul@@ ate the product or the process before construc@@ ting it in a real mode , avoiding this way failures and avo@@ idable expenses .
Pl@@ m has facilit@@ ated the development of the cameras of Canon , the air@@ planes of Su@@ k@@ ho@@ i or the most famous utili@@ t@@ arian cars of N@@ iss@@ an .
Sieg@@ fried Russ@@ wur@@ m , person in charge of the Siemens industrial division , explains that the use of this computer science instrument in his F@@ 1 factory has allowed Red Bul@@ l to design and make &quot; in a few hours , almost in time real , &quot; the modifications , changes and improvements that are needed during the races and tests .
Russ@@ wur@@ m explains that the team in 1992 had an average of 10 techni@@ cians who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season .
Red Bul@@ l has 180 professional young people with high qualifications working today who , equipped with powerful computer science equipment , analyse and project all kind of modifications to the cars .
The Siemens manager explained that the software PL@@ M is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bul@@ l cars except for the engine , which is the entirely the responsibility of Ren@@ ault .
The materials , fuel , aer@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics and elements of security are being modified .
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simul@@ ator to the reality in 24 hours , thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and auto@@ cla@@ ves of high tech .
The only limitation of this spark of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formul@@ a 1 can spend at the most every season in order to facilitate the competition .
Red Bul@@ l has build a high-tech factory for designing and producing its cars in a loc@@ ality about 50 K@@ M from London .
There are two buildings in which visits are restricted , especially for journalists .
Everything that occurs there is considered &quot; Top Sec@@ ret . &quot;
The factory has 5@@ 80 employees , including its two drivers , the champion V@@ ett@@ el and Mark Web@@ ber .
The Red Bul@@ l her@@ o , without any doubt , is the recent champion Sebastian V@@ et@@ ell .
Among the immense technological resources that the energe@@ tic drink brand has put to the service of its participation in the circu@@ its , other prot@@ agon@@ ists hide whose contribution is in@@ estim@@ able and their not@@ ori@@ ety un@@ recognised .
The head of technology at the factory , Steve Nev@@ ey , affir@@ ms that five years ago it was possible to affir@@ m that the advances of I + D in the cars contributed to 50 % to the vic@@ tories and the drivers were responsible for the rest .
Today these percent@@ ages have varied and the technology adds 85 % of the success , while the drivers contribute with 15 % to the added value .
Nev@@ ey recogni@@ zes that neither V@@ ett@@ el or Web@@ ber will never be replaced by computer science since &quot; they are indispensable gla@@ di@@ ators . &quot;
HP will open in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) inau@@ gur@@ ated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner P@@ ont Re@@ yes .
This it will be first of the network of 20 stores having among 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational anticip@@ ates to open in Spain during the next two years .
The company will make compatible this initiative with the 16 areas already present in big centers as PC City , Car@@ ref@@ our , Satur@@ n and El Cor@@ te In@@ g@@ les .
The vic@@ e-@@ president of HP Spain , Hel@@ ena Herr@@ ero , gave as example the remo@@ d@@ elled store located in the Barcelon@@ an Gran Via , property of P@@ ont Re@@ yes , with whom she collabor@@ ated for 30 years .
The North American group has prepared a plan to open 200 points of sale in Europe in 2013 , strategy which includes the 20 Spanish establishments .
The first ones to open were in Bu@@ char@@ est ( Rum@@ ania ) and Bel@@ grade ( Serbia ) the last week , being Barcelona .
Herr@@ ero did not want to reveal the following possible open@@ ings , although she recognized that Madrid could be the following dest@@ iny .
Also the director of HP on personal systems assured that the philosophy to open the stores will be always the same , based on a local distribut@@ or with experience and knowledge of the sector .
The North American group provides consultancy services and is in charge with the exclusive furniture design of the stores ( with products that can be touched of interactive form ) , that in Europe will have an identical image .
In addition , HP covers the formation of the personnel of the establishments .
Hel@@ ena Herr@@ ero denied that it was a system of fran@@ chise and empha@@ sized that the exclusive network of commerce tries &quot; to improve the service towards the client and the SMEs in the purchase , the attention , post-@@ selling and even packing . &quot;
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pione@@ ering pilot program at a world-@@ wide level that is in charge with solving the possible problems of a computer science equipment of HP still with guarantee .
An online service connects a technical center located in the Maastricht ( Holland ) .
&quot; Thus , in 10 minutes we can resolve problems that sometimes can last up to two days . &quot;
&quot; This system is especially designed for SMEs and users , since the great companies already have contrac@@ ted services of technical attend@@ ance , &quot; mentioned Hel@@ ena Herr@@ ero yesterday .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell bets on &quot; ste@@ aling &quot; one million clients from its ri@@ vals in three years
More optimistic than other managers , the deleg@@ ated advis@@ or of Sab@@ ad@@ ell Bank , Ja@@ ime Gu@@ ardi@@ ola , thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank , but dis@@ cards initially a new crisis of liquidity and predic@@ ts the end of the war of li@@ abilities .
In spite of it , he anticip@@ ates a collapse of the marg@@ ins of interests that will try to partly compensate with raised commission@@ s and the price of the credit .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell hopes to catch in three years a million particular clients .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell has found a way of explo@@ iting the next three years and being able to survive in very complicated economic surroundings .
The bank will start up in 2011 a new director plan that will have a validity of three years .
The objective , besides survi@@ ving without need@@ ing to appeal to the public aid of F@@ RO@@ B , is to gain market quota by getting a million of new particular clients -@@ 7@@ 00@@ .000 if are dis@@ counted those that might leave the bank , pending on assign@@ ment , since until now they spo@@ iled more the SMEs and companies than the retail client .
This year has caught 25@@ 0.000 particular clients and 5@@ 0.000 companies .
Its market quota of individuals is of 3,5 % , whereas in companies sur@@ passes 10 % .
Another base of the plan 20@@ 11-@@ 2013 is the bet on productivity , meaning , of austerity , with reduction of costs as objective , and whose challenges will be exhi@@ bited by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise .
Fe@@ w banks dare during these times to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has changed all of the plans for the global bank .
Sab@@ ad@@ ell , in fact , will close this year its director plan Optim@@ a , hi@@ red four years ago , although initially it was for three , but the market conditions forced him to extend it into one more year .
The clients who give up savings will be his main objective .
During a breakfast organized by the AP@@ IE , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola insi@@ sted that 2011 &quot; is going to be a difficult and tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ental year . &quot;
The executive , in fact , thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain &quot; will be slow . &quot;
In addition , in two or three years there will be &quot; very difficult to create jobs , &quot; something fundamental for the survival of the banking business .
And , although he thinks that the war of the li@@ abilities - that pen@@ alizes the marg@@ ins@@ - is being reduced , the price of the risk subsidies that banks are paying for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity are already moving to the cost of the credit to compensate the fall of the marg@@ ins .
The subject of liquidity and financing is fundamental , and is going to be a pressure factor on credit .
&quot; We haven &apos;t closed the f@@ auc@@ et , but the differenti@@ als are more important , &quot; recognized Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
Ban@@ es@@ to already issued orders on Thursday to his network to limit the long term credit and to raise the price of the differenti@@ als - See Cin@@ co@@ D@@ í@@ as from 2@@ 2nd and 27@@ th of November .
Also he recognized that the tendency of the bank now &quot; it is to raise the commission@@ s , &quot; but &quot; within a competitive frame . &quot;
The director plan of Sab@@ ad@@ ell is based on the organic growth , although , as always , the group does not disc@@ ard corpor@@ ative operations .
Not in v@@ ain , ass@@ ures that in Spain &quot; major sizes are going to be required . &quot;
&quot; Next year everything will move , &quot; he assured .
He affir@@ ms that capital needs have &quot; risen too much &quot; and it does not disc@@ ard that some Spanish financial organization enters within red numbers .
And he men@@ tions that the F@@ RO@@ B can replace the market in fund@@ raising before new rec@@ ap@@ itali@@ z@@ ations .
After ass@@ uring that Sab@@ ad@@ ell can survive the temporary closing of the markets , he pays attention to which some ban@@ kers already predic@@ ted as a new crisis of liquidity .
He says that there cannot be em@@ itted , but unlike to what had happened in June , is possible to obtain short term financing through agreements , which sof@@ tens the crisis .
The C@@ EC@@ A dis@@ cards a second big wave of fu@@ sions in the saving banks
The chief of a main direc@@ torate of the C@@ EC@@ A , J@@ ose Antonio O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta , dis@@ car@@ ded yesterday that a big wave of fu@@ sions of savings banks is going to take place and insi@@ sted once again on the speed with which the reconstruction of the sector is being made .
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started , the there were several organizations that assured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be expect the second round .
Nevertheless , the chief of a main direc@@ torate of the Spanish Con@@ federation of Sav@@ ings banks ( C@@ EC@@ A ) , J@@ ose Antonio O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta , dis@@ car@@ ded yesterday that this new big wave of operations is going to take place .
I believe that the greatest part of the fu@@ sions has occurred , the incorpor@@ ation of Ca@@ j@@ as@@ ol to the group of Ban@@ ca Civi@@ ca cannot be called a second round , there are only adjustments .
&quot; The biggest part is completely done ; perhaps instead of 17 we could have 13 or 14 but all the great processes have been done under the surveillance of Bank of Spain , that has collabor@@ ated very many to this matter , &quot; pointed the manager .
In declarations during a breakfast of the Manager Association and Exec@@ u@@ tives of Ara@@ g@@ ón ( AD@@ EA ) , O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken &quot; with the greatest possible speed , and we must be very satisfied of how this happens in the terms that at the time , not now , were marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain , &quot; he empha@@ sized .
To go from 45 saving banks with an average of 28@@ .@@ 500 million volume of assets to 17 with 7@@ 5.@@ 500 million is a process that does not have comparison in history , reducing the number of organizations to a 62 % so that they are much bigger to fulfil Basi@@ le@@ a , he under@@ lined .
O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta recognized that there is &quot; a series of opinions rather p@@ essimis@@ tic on the slow@@ ness of the process &quot; that demonstrates &quot; a lack of seri@@ ousness and reason , &quot; because &quot; what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must fulfil the term before the end of year . &quot;
The chief of a main direc@@ torate of C@@ EC@@ A , J@@ ose Antonio O@@ lav@@ arri@@ eta , assured yesterday that Spain has the more rigorous financial system of all Europe and &quot; probably &quot; of the whole world , and he attributed to those who call into question the &quot; lack of knowledge . &quot;
The manager showed that , within the present economic con@@ junc@@ ture , &quot; we can be very relaxed &quot; with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks , a system that has undertaken a &quot; very important &quot; concentration process and that &quot; goes with the greatest possible speed . &quot;
Also he remembered that the Spanish bank came out very well with the stress tests that the B@@ CE made in July .
Zap@@ ater@@ o and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to maintain the Euro , but has established the conditions for all the Union .
The market tensions have brought about a double governmental response .
On the one hand , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez Zap@@ ater@@ o has suggested new measures of adjustment , from fiscal reductions to the SMEs , regulation of private agencies of positioning or sup@@ pression of the 4@@ 26 Euros of aid to unemployed without contributions , to the privati@@ zation of 49 % of A@@ EN@@ A , the management of the airports of Bar@@ aj@@ as and El P@@ rat and of 30 % of Lot@@ ter@@ ies of the State .
On the other hand , Vice-@@ president El@@ ena Sal@@ g@@ ado , with the support of the ex-@@ president Feli@@ pe Gonz@@ á@@ lez , has added to the critics to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Angela Merkel her responsibility in unt@@ ying the present crisis .
How can those movements be interpreted ?
She continues that the position of Merkel is not an error in her communic@@ ative policy .
On the contrary , it is another bol@@ t tigh@@ tening in the difficult process of re@@ definition of the Euro .
And there Germany has a radic@@ ally new vision on how its future must be like , that contradi@@ cts the one of maintaining the old traditions of its main partners .
Against the European resistance , in Germany there are spec@@ ulations on three possible ex@@ its from the crisis .
First , a strong Euro , integrated by itself , Austria and Holland , among others countries , while the south would leave the monetary zone .
Second , the recovery of the German mark , although now seems to be science fiction , with a very favourable current of opinion , near 50 % of the population .
Third , a re@@ design of the Euro , according to the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control , budgetary rig@@ or , fines to the trans@@ gres@@ sor countries , possible sus@@ pensions of payments to some of them and extension of the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments .
The German position is clear and comes defining itself over a long time , so there are no exc@@ uses .
Firstly , in 2009 , when as much the IMF as the European Commission stim@@ ulated the deficits , the German Government presented a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from 20@@ 16 .
This was the first signal of diver@@ gence between what Germany thought it had to do ( plans of fiscal stric@@ tness and stability in the public finances ) , and what its European partners were doing , including France .
The second head@@ ache for the Central European country was when Merkel lab@@ ori@@ ously extended the decision of rescu@@ ing Greece .
Then it was the object of fer@@ o@@ cious cri@@ tic , but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece .
Finally , during the last days of October , Merkel emerg@@ es again with a clear position , demanding the reform of treaties of the Union , in order to make possible the rescue of a country and , at the same time forcing , the private mon@@ ey@@ len@@ ders to run with part of the cost .
This position has been interpreted as anti-@@ European , since it has pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the Irish crisis and all the rest .
But her proposal , although somewhat swe@@ et@@ ened , has been approved and , in the next months , we would have to attend the process of reform of the Union that makes possible those measures starting with 2013 .
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not warrant crossing .
And it is saying to us all that , although now it has to take measures with which perhaps it does not agree , starting with that date the old functioning of the Euro , will have been finished .
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area , in which the viol@@ ating countries will be severely sanc@@ tioned , can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and , in that case , the private sector also will support part of the cost .
Germany is telling us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of saving and investment , moder@@ ation in consumption , improvements in productivity , competitiveness and positive balances .
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction , with enormous deficits in the balance of payments , as the one faced by Spanish growth during the years of the boom , will not be toler@@ ated .
The offer is clear .
We should better understand it .
It is not about trying to lead back the public deficit to 3 % in 2013 .
What they ask us is much harder .
And the worst thing than we could do in these circumstances is to k@@ id ourselves .
I hope that the present tur@@ bul@@ ences would open the path to a greater tranqu@@ illi@@ ty
and that we take advantage of the time that they have given us , until the spring of 2013 .
It seems that president Zap@@ ater@@ o has understood it the same way and its double mani@@ fest ( the reforms promised after the meeting of the last Saturday with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures ) suggests that , in spite of the critics to Merkel , has laid way to the thesis according to which one should put order in the house .
But the red line that Germany has drawn up there it is , and it does seem that is going be moved .
And , among the possibilities that are contem@@ pl@@ ated , the one of leaving a monetary zone of little serious countries cannot be excluded .
Then , Germany will always tell us that it had warned us .
Sport and fraud law
Tri@@ cks such as those of Al@@ on@@ so and Ram@@ os before the A@@ j@@ ax demonstrate wi@@ tt@@ iness but not the will to get remove of a sanc@@ tion .
The exp@@ ul@@ sion presum@@ ably for@@ ged by two players of Real Madrid ( X@@ ab@@ i Al@@ on@@ so and Ser@@ gio Ram@@ os ) in the game played on the 23@@ rd of November against A@@ j@@ ax in Champ@@ ions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behaviour is or is not un@@ spor@@ ts@@ man@@ like and if , both players should be sanc@@ tioned by U@@ EFA .
As we all know , a few minutes before the end of the game ( that their team had already won ) , both players deliberately wast@@ ed time which made the refer@@ ee show the second yellow card to both of them .
This way , and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group , both players will fulfil the prescri@@ bed sanc@@ tion during the next game of leag@@ ue , against Au@@ x@@ er@@ re , and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase .
Finally , the committee of discipline of the U@@ EFA has sanc@@ tioned with two games the tra@@ iner of the team , J@@ ose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , and with different economic amounts the imp@@ lied players .
The pro@@ vocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice , but rather frequent in the world of football .
It is so extended that it part of the e@@ thos , of the un@@ written rules , but followed nonetheless by this sport .
Part of the debate ar@@ isen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the Real Madrid organization ( that in its hy@@ m@@ n pres@@ umes of no@@ bility and honour , and that has fined its players for an@@ alog@@ ous acts ) and by the dram@@ ati@@ zation or@@ chest@@ rated , apparently , by M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , who adds one more to his expanded history of hi@@ stri@@ onic and provo@@ king techni@@ cian .
Any@@ way , the debate deals with if that type of behaviour not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradi@@ cts the principles of the sport , that is to say , if with these actions fraud is committed ; then , indeed , they are resp@@ ect@@ ful actions with the sport regulation , but they seem to el@@ ude its sense .
The matter exam@@ ines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit .
One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players , aspect that with these actions wasn &apos;t put into danger , that is to say , there was no violent game .
Another of these advantages to which it is all@@ u@@ ded to with the f@@ are@@ -@@ play is to avoid that the team of the law break@@ er players takes advantage un@@ ju@@ stly of the opposite team , which did not happen either .
However , the paradox@@ ical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally character@@ ize as legal fraud , because the violation of the rules was not made sec@@ re@@ tly as to try to avoid the sanc@@ tion , but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the refer@@ ee .
They wa@@ ited for and accepted the sanc@@ tion with no complaints .
Another question is what type of advantage the viol@@ ators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out .
Here it seems necessary to state that it isn &apos;t a dis@@ advan@@ tage@@ ous situation for ri@@ val nor is an obtained benefit in the same game , because evi@@ dently the result of the action sup@@ poses leaving their own team with less players .
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game , because the club will not be able to count on those players .
The advantage , obviously , consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game .
But it is about a long term advantage , with a certain degree of in@@ determination , because the team can be eliminated first of change , and in addition with this action the players fulfil a sanc@@ tion game and go to the second cycle of cards , in which the suspension by card accum@@ ulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle .
So that , by passing rounds , it is not so clear that it is an advantage .
Those actions are really against the sporting spirit , which is part of the strategic decisions that favour taking advantages allowed by the rules .
Regarding this assumption , the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanc@@ tion ( this would have been a clear case of legal fraud ) , but rather chosen when to o@@ bey it .
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment .
Although the border between the wi@@ tt@@ iness and the law fraud is diff@@ use , in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wi@@ tt@@ iness .
The contro@@ vers@@ y seems to arise from two factors : because it was about two auto exp@@ ul@@ sions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them .
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic .
Off@@ ensive of supplies to catch Christmas d@@ inners of groups in B@@ C@@ N
The way the days fall this year , there is a concentration of reservations on the 16th and 17th .
The celebrations of the employees , who want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros .
As nou@@ g@@ at and lot@@ tery , once with December the group d@@ inners before Christmas return , that continue being an gas@@ p of fresh air for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona , that because of the crisis has ended with an offensive of price fix@@ ing in order to be able to catch the majority share of customers : almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros on d@@ inners or meals , agree the managers and associations in the inter@@ viewed sector .
In order to finish complic@@ ating the accounting , the calendar of this year ( for falling the New Year &apos;s E@@ ve on Friday ) concentrated the requests in the week of the 13th of December , with the result until that date of an av@@ al@@ anche of reserves of d@@ inners for weekend ( 16 and 17 ) and hardly movement for the previous week .
As was happening from 2008 , when the stage of cost-@@ cutting began , there were many companies that have eliminated collective d@@ inners for budgetary reason .
For not ru@@ ining the tradition , many workers maintain it by paying it out of their own po@@ cket .
Whatever con@@ junc@@ ture , everyone demanded a price war , confirms the president of the Gre@@ mi Rest@@ oration of Barcelona , G@@ ai@@ et Far@@ rs .
The representative of the employ@@ er &apos;s association , today , does not dare to predic@@ t whether th@@ ee will be celebrations this month . &quot;
&quot; People consider it long before making the reservation . &quot;
&quot; They want to go out but they have in mind the price situation , &quot; he men@@ tions .
The business will go &quot; well for those who give quality for good price and with good attend@@ ance , &quot; he adds , and remin@@ ds that the clients tend to come down one step once with the crisis , so that the strip around the 25 Euros has become a demand for the majority .
In a pol@@ l made in diverse cent@@ ric establishments one can see the collapse of reservations for the night of the 17th .
So@@ ter@@ as group indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday , with the pre@@ tension of spending no more than 30 Euros , to which they have responded by adapting its menus with formul@@ as of 25 and 35 Euros .
In another of the most powerful groups , An@@ di@@ lan@@ a , with 16 establishments in the city ( Host@@ al de la R@@ ita , Market , La Fon@@ da and others ) , the pec@@ uli@@ arity of the calendar has involved more anticipated reserves , even since the beginning of November .
&quot; We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices of the year last , with menus for all the tastes from 19.@@ 95 to 30 Euros , &quot; they detail .
In AN Gru@@ p , which involves El Mus@@ so@@ l , At@@ tic , Qu@@ Qu , and up to a total of 23 bars , they remain optimistic after det@@ ecting an increase of the invo@@ ic@@ ing from the second sem@@ ester and some good , although concentrated , perspective of business for Christmas .
Sour@@ ces of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyper@@ active day concerning friend groups that celebrate the holidays .
To their six menus of the group they have added a Christmas one , with 30 Euros or more as star budget and the perception that there is a pre@@ dis@@ position to spend 10 % more than last year in exchange for demanding more details , if necessary .
They also see green bu@@ ds in some companies that invite their employees and the gr@@ ater the volume the better .
On behalf of the F@@ ec@@ as@@ arm employ@@ er &apos;s association ( that includes organizations like the Association of Bars , Restaurants and Lei@@ sure of Barcelona ) , its vic@@ e-@@ president , En@@ ric Gom@@ à , believes he is beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel and considers that altogether the reserves are &quot; che@@ er@@ ful , &quot; although the clients &quot; negotiate &quot; as much as possible .
Indeed , the illu@@ sion of celebr@@ ating has not decre@@ ased for wh@@ o@@ ever pays , indicates this one .
The Pakist@@ ani nuclear program generates great rest@@ less@@ ness in the USA
Islam@@ ab@@ ad produces atom@@ ic weapons at &quot; a rate faster than any other country . &quot;
The fil@@ tr@@ ations of Wiki@@ le@@ aks confirm the bonds between the Taliban people and Pakistan .
The content of the correspon@@ dence between the American emb@@ ass@@ y in Pakistan and the Department of State of the USA fil@@ tered by the Wiki@@ le@@ aks portal confirms the enormous rest@@ less@@ ness which the Pakist@@ ani nuclear program brings about in Washington .
Besides the en@@ ligh@@ tening and substantial details that are offered on the content of the convers@@ ations and the thoughts of the credited North American diplomatic representatives in Islam@@ ab@@ ad , the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in the matter of atom@@ ic security , instead of increasing , &quot; decre@@ ases , &quot; and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons with &quot; a rhyth@@ m faster than any other country . &quot;
The pec@@ uli@@ arity of the Pakist@@ ani nuclear program - that the arms are not assemb@@ led but they remain stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack@@ -- it constitutes one of the main causes for concern in Washington .
Thus is en@@ um@@ er@@ ated by the amb@@ ass@@ ador in Pakistan , An@@ ne W. Pat@@ ter@@ son , in a report previous to the visit of the ex@@ - advis@@ or of National Security , James Jones : &quot; The proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under Taliban attack , the ru@@ mo@@ ured disp@@ er@@ sion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atom@@ ic materials transportation . &quot;
The high number of people imp@@ lied in the nuclear ar@@ sen@@ als and the missi@@ les programs is being taken into consideration , not only by the USA , but also by Russia , such as the reason for maintaining its guard .
&quot; Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious belief@@ s in order to protect the nuclear power plants ; given the poor educ@@ ative and cultural levels , the extrem@@ ist organizations have more opportunities to recru@@ it people to work in the nuclear programs or of missi@@ les , &quot; said the expert Y@@ ur@@ i Car@@ ole , from the Russian Ministry of External Affairs , in a meeting with his Americans hom@@ olog@@ ous .
The newest information on the documentation fil@@ tered by the portal of Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange is the decre@@ asing cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakist@@ ani rate of nuclear weapon production .
An office of the emb@@ ass@@ y in May , that describes as &quot; frustr@@ ating &quot; the communication with Pakistan , says that : &quot; The transparency is frequently non@@ exist@@ ent ; the offers of aid remain without an answer or are refused . &quot;
In another message , Peter L@@ avo@@ y , civil serv@@ ant of the National Intelli@@ gence for the south of Asia , states that &quot; in spite of the economic catastro@@ phe , Pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhyth@@ m faster than any other country of the world . &quot;
The amb@@ ass@@ ador Pat@@ ter@@ son also asks Washington , during a visit of the head of the Army , General Ash@@ fa@@ q K@@ ay@@ ani , to give clear orders to the person in charge that &quot; the Army of Pakistan must end the tac@@ it support to the terrorist groups . &quot;
H@@ unting of the head of Wiki@@ le@@ aks
Obama ap@@ points a person in charge of the anti@@ terrorism fight in order to avoid new fil@@ tr@@ ations .
Inter@@ pol em@@ its a red alert with the purpose of following the movements and loc@@ ating Ass@@ ange where he might is .
All that is related to Wiki@@ le@@ aks and its founder , Juli@@ an Ass@@ ange , forms a complicated lab@@ y@@ rin@@ th in which it is difficult to have certainty on any of the facts .
Yesterday Inter@@ pol em@@ itted one &quot; red alert &quot; in order &quot; to locate and follow the movements &quot; of Ass@@ ange .
Nevertheless , this isn &apos;t a traditional order of arrest .
In addition , it isn &apos;t new , because it dates from the 20th of November .
And has nothing to do with the last fil@@ tration of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents per@@ taining to the USA but with the accus@@ ations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden .
In addition , the lawyer of the cre@@ ator of Wiki@@ le@@ aks , Mark Steph@@ ens , ass@@ ures that &quot; the police knows where and how to get into contact with Mr. Ass@@ ange . &quot;
It was day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Ly@@ ons ( France ) issued the order at the request of Sweden , but did not reveal it until yesterday , after receiving authori@@ zation from the authorities of that country .
Given the facts , the 18@@ 8 countries of Inter@@ pol have indications for identifying or loc@@ ating to Ass@@ ange &quot; with respect to his pro@@ visi@@ onal arrest and ex@@ tradition . &quot;
Although the Inter@@ pol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert , many of the Member States , as the organization explained , consider the call network notice free way for making an arrest --@@ that has to undertake the national body of police , - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of ex@@ tradition , as it is the case of Sweden and England , where Ass@@ ange might be .
The movement ir@@ rit@@ ated the lawyers of Ass@@ ange , who published yesterday a letter den@@ o@@ unc@@ ing that the founder of Wiki@@ le@@ aks , 39 years old , declared being willing to take part in a video conference in order to answer any questions from the Swedish authorities .
They also recall that Ass@@ ange asked and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the public prosec@@ utor in his case , whom they compare with the myth@@ ical Lav@@ r@@ enti@@ y P@@ av@@ lo@@ vi@@ ch Beri@@ a , head of security of Stalin .
&quot; This seems to be hunting , not a legal persecution , &quot; den@@ oun@@ ces the letter .
While the world was searching for him - and from Australia his mother def@@ ends the inno@@ c@@ ence of her son@@ -- Ass@@ ange follows in unknown wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs , but not in silence .
On Monday gave from an unknown place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype , a conversation in which he requested the resign@@ ation of the Secretary of State of the USA , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; If it is possible to show that she was responsible for ordering American diplom@@ ats to sp@@ y in the ON@@ U viol@@ ating international treaties that the USA has signed , she should res@@ ign , &quot; he said .
His opinion was ins@@ ul@@ ted yesterday by the press secret@@ ary of the White House , Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs , who described as &quot; ridicul@@ ous and absurd &quot; the resign@@ ation request .
&quot; I don &apos;t know why we should pay any attention to the opinion of a man with a web page &quot; declared the CN@@ N .
Obama himself has ordered to a high person in charge with the anti@@ terrorism fight , Rus@@ ell Tra@@ vers , to prevent new document le@@ aks .
The attempt by the spo@@ kes@@ man of President Barack Obama to reduce the attention paid to Ass@@ ange contra@@ sts with opinions that politicians and comm@@ ent@@ ators now proc@@ la@@ im .
Peter King , the con@@ gres@@ sman who from January will presi@@ de over the Committee of National Security in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , has asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wiki@@ le@@ aks in the list of terrorist organizations &quot; in order to take part and his funds and to persec@@ ute anyone who give them any contribution or help . &quot;
Furthermore went Tom F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an , an advis@@ er of the Canadian president Stephen Har@@ per , who had to withdraw his opinion after saying that Ass@@ ange would have to be murdered . &quot;
&quot; Obama should turn him into an objective and use a non mann@@ ed aircraft or something . &quot;
Who did not ap@@ ologi@@ ze was Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee , B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st minister , ex-@@ govern@@ or of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as and possible candidate to the presidency .
&quot; W@@ ho@@ ever he is in the Government the one who le@@ aked the information is guilty of treas@@ on and anything that is not the execution would be a too much gentle punishment , &quot; declared for Fox .
Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s looks for peace in ER@@ C with win@@ ks to those who have the same opinion as C@@ aro@@ d
The re@@ public@@ an leader will allow the party a secret voting regarding his continuity .
Hu@@ gu@@ et proposes a more pl@@ ural executive and the end of the full meeting system .
Jo@@ an Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s seems to have found the pres@@ cription for negotiating for the ump@@ teenth time the internal revol@@ t in the ER@@ C , without a sight for the loss of 11 dep@@ u@@ ties and half of the votes .
The president of the party is conscious that his threat of resign@@ ation is insufficient for the supporters of the ex@@ - leader Jose@@ p L@@ lu@@ í@@ s C@@ aro@@ d-@@ Ro@@ vi@@ ra , but he also knows that the influence of that sector today is so dil@@ uted as his own ment@@ or and can cause the him wor@@ ries that he had with other ext@@ inc@@ t curr@@ ents .
For this reason , the leader of Es@@ qu@@ err@@ a will try to gain the new critics with win@@ ks that allow him to be protected until the municipal elections .
In order to begin , Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s announced yesterday that more than 200 national advis@@ ors of ER@@ C could pron@@ ounce priv@@ ately on his continuity .
By means of tickets , and not by raised hand .
If the supporters of C@@ aro@@ d want to carry certain vote of punishment to the president , they can do it without fear to ret@@ ali@@ ation .
In fact , the head of the ranks wants to avoid the division image as much as the one of submission to him .
In several interviews , he affir@@ med that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes , but added , without mentioning the percentage , that w@@ ouldn &apos;t be good either a result &quot; a la Bulgarian . &quot;
The close supporters of C@@ aro@@ d demand the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the milit@@ ancy , a gest@@ ure that is not worth when Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s controls the most important organ between con@@ gres@@ ses .
But for not having the majority sufficient to force resign@@ ations , they are going to try to decide with the executive a direction from now until May .
For this , they hope to participate in the elabor@@ ation of the document of strategic re@@ orientation that the direction will put under voting of the national advice on day 18 .
Its intention is to speak for Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s in exchange for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011 , something that the c@@ up@@ ola considers already done .
The ER@@ C leader recognized that &quot; poly@@ ph@@ ony &quot; har@@ ms stability and that its objective is to make , once and for all , the organization able to w@@ ash the dirty ra@@ gs inside .
In this line , is symp@@ tom@@ atic the article that coun@@ s@@ ell@@ or in functions Jose@@ p Hu@@ gu@@ et posted on his blog .
Consi@@ dering the ide@@ ologist Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s , the holder of Innov@@ aci@@ ó considers a fulfilled act that the leader will be authentic@@ ated &quot; in exchange of diverse objectives . &quot;
And he en@@ um@@ er@@ ated five , of which two are empha@@ sized .
First , &quot; re@@ com@@ pose &quot; the executive so that it represents at least 90 % of the milit@@ ancy , that is to say , to include new faces that come from the sector compatible with C@@ aro@@ d .
The second can be the great new@@ ness .
Hu@@ gu@@ et proposes that ER@@ C elimin@@ ates the assembly as an operation mechanism .
Thus , proposes a reform of the stat@@ utes that allows celebr@@ ating the con@@ gres@@ ses through deleg@@ ates chosen by suff@@ rage .
En@@ ding with the assembly model , an exception in the Spanish system of parties has been an ob@@ session of the team of Pu@@ ig@@ cer@@ c@@ ó@@ s that already batt@@ led in this sense in both last con@@ gres@@ ses .
In fact , the conv@@ ul@@ se conc@@ la@@ ve of the 2008 let the mission of direction review of the assembly in a specific congress of reform of stat@@ utes .
This meeting wasn &apos;t held yet , because the internal flood of the last years advised against confron@@ ting the subject .
Now , without critical sectors on the matter , could be a good moment to re@@ take it and try to close it for always .

China maintains the objectives of reducing gases of greenhouse effect
The representative of that country at the CO@@ P@@ 16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts for reducing the carbon track and detailed that he maintains his offer of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 % by 2020 .
China maintains its offer of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by the year 2020 , assured Su W@@ ei , China &apos;s representative to the CO@@ P@@ 16 .
In his first public appearance in the 16th U@@ J Conference on Clim@@ atic Chan@@ ges ( CO@@ P@@ 16 ) , Su W@@ ei assured that his country has made enormous efforts for reducing the carbon track and re@@ conver@@ ting its industry .
In fact , during the last four years his country has invested 2@@ 45 million dollars in dimin@@ ishing its greenhouse gas emissions .
Nevertheless , he made it clear that China will not modify its objectives , but will continue working jointly with the international community in that matter .
He added that the Chinese strategy regarding the matter of clim@@ atic change is divided into four parts : dialogue ; construction of capacities ; construction of institutions and endor@@ sement to pilot programs .
In all those parts , advances have been made , including the approval , last year , of a new Energy law , with objectives regarding the reduction of gas emissions , he explained .
On the other hand , he empha@@ sized that in China , the federal authorities have been working of a coordinated way with and the state and local ones , in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving , use of efficient energy and reduction of emissions .
In addition , there are in being developed or are already concluded diverse multi@@ annual plans , as much financed by the Chinese government , such as by the governments of other countries .
For example , he referred to the Program of Eff@@ ici@@ ent Use of Energy , that was implemented during the last the five years and that received investments from the Organization of the United Nations ( ON@@ U ) , the government and the private initiative .
There is also being developed a provin@@ cial project of clim@@ atic change , another one for the change of inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent centres by econom@@ iz@@ ers and another of mitig@@ ation and adaptation , he detailed .
At the same table , Martin K@@ rol , scientific advis@@ er of the government of that country in the matter of clim@@ atic change , assured that the China &apos;s efforts have been greater than generally perceived .
For example , he states , the greenhouse gas emission per capita in China is six tons by person , whereas in the United States is of 100 tons ; China is responsible for the 9 percent of the historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions .
Also , it efforts without precedent in the use of the energy , in increasing by 20 percent its energy efficiency over the last five years and anticip@@ ates to do the same towards year 2020 , he added .
Bo@@ unded to the leg@@ ality exp@@ ul@@ sion of Esp@@ ino : Ca@@ es@@ ar Nav@@ a
The national leader of the P@@ AN detailed that the ex-@@ b@@ aker leader is within his right to go to the Commission of National Order to protest according to his rights .
The national leader of the P@@ AN , Ca@@ es@@ ar Nav@@ a V@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ ez , assured that the exp@@ ul@@ sion of Manuel Esp@@ ino Barri@@ ent@@ os was become attached to the leg@@ ality and that the ex@@ - leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to protest according to his rights .
In a previous interview to the protest of Gab@@ ino Cu@@ é Mon@@ te@@ agu@@ do as govern@@ or of the state , he said that anyway the exp@@ ul@@ sion of Esp@@ ino is a decision made in the local area .
&quot; It is about an independent decision by the Commission of the Order of Son@@ ora . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Esp@@ ino has the right to go , where appropriate , via a claim made to the Commission of Order of the National Council , being a decision taken in the scope of an authorized organ , &quot; he wrote .
On the other hand , he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that never was there in the negotiation table an alliance for the presidential candi@@ d@@ acy .
Nav@@ a V@@ á@@ z@@ qu@@ ez was convinced that the National Action will get forti@@ fied in the internal election of 4th and 5th of December , where will be chosen his successor . &quot;
This ( an alliance in the 2012 ) is a subject that was never discussed at the negotiation table , or at least not thus far , it was an ex@@ position for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective , &quot; he referred to .
The leader under@@ lined that P@@ AN is supported by 71 years of dialogue , the reason why &quot; we are not afraid of the internal competition ; on the contrary &quot; we enjoy it and makes us stronger . &quot;
He said that without any doubt that the council will know how to choose the best leader than the National Action would require for the next three years , for that reason he will give the office &quot; to whom the council choo@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; I have that absolute tranqu@@ illi@@ ty and openness ; to anyone of the five I would be proud to give the office of the president of party . &quot;
He for@@ et@@ old that the rise the party registered during the past elections on the 4th July will be reflected in the next fi@@ ghts , although &quot; it is not the time yet for thinking about 2012 . &quot;
&quot; So far it is about accompanying Govern@@ or Gab@@ ino Cu@@ é in this duty . &quot;
In this framework , it stood out that the three governments of alli@@ ances in O@@ ax@@ aca , Pu@@ eb@@ la and Sin@@ alo@@ a will be the reason for observation in the entire country , for that reason &quot; many hopes , year@@ nings are put in them , and I am sure that Gab@@ ino will be equal to the challenges . &quot;
While being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated on the critics of the PR@@ I to President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ ón for his speech within the framework of the four years of his government , Ces@@ ar Nav@@ a asked the PR@@ I members to reflect on the 6 years terms of the former pres@@ idents Ern@@ es@@ to Z@@ edi@@ ll@@ o and Carlos Sal@@ inas de Gor@@ tar@@ i .
If the PR@@ I thinks that the governments of Z@@ edi@@ ll@@ o and Sal@@ inas were better than those of Fox and Cal@@ der@@ ón ; they should begin defending them ; and leave the clos@@ et , he affir@@ med .
He considered that the holder of the federal Executive can say expressions as the ones he said during his speech in the National Audi@@ ence , because in the country there is no ga@@ g or c@@ ensure .
Pro@@ mo@@ te Obama in Twitter law in favour of und@@ oc@@ um@@ ented students
If you agree to the approval of the law Dre@@ am Act , calls your sen@@ ators and make them approve this legislation , twi@@ t@@ tered the American president on the popular social network .
President Barack Obama has joined today the national mobili@@ zation supporting the law Dre@@ am Act , for leg@@ alizing und@@ oc@@ um@@ ented students , with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter .
If you agree to the approval of the law Dre@@ am Act , calls your sen@@ ators and make them approve this legislation , t@@ we@@ eted Obama .
His brief message maintains open a cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ tic link with an am@@ pler document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the sen@@ ators , since the vote of the legislation is im@@ min@@ ent .
If a expected vote is made soon , now is the moment for your voice to be heard , he indicates .
The message was disclos@@ ed after the 42 re@@ public@@ an sen@@ ators threatened to block the vote of any legislation , unless it is approved the extension of cuts of taxes of the Bush era and the financing of the government .
Such block@@ ade , announced in a letter signed by the 42 re@@ public@@ an sen@@ ators , could affect the vote on the law Dre@@ am Act and other projects as the ratification of the new treaty ST@@ ART with Russia against the nuclear weapon proliferation .
A@@ sk@@ ed about the re@@ public@@ an block@@ ade of the law Dre@@ am Act and other projects , the presidential spo@@ kes@@ man Robert Gi@@ b@@ bs tru@@ sted that once the fiscal matter has been solved , a schedule for the rest of the projects could be established .
&quot; I think there is plenty of time ... &quot;
&quot; We all agree that the fiscal issue should be resolved before the end of the year ... &quot;
&quot; I believe that we can obtain an agreement in this matter and later we can plan the sequence of the rest , &quot; he said .
The leader of the democratic Sen@@ ate majority , Harry Rei@@ d , announced on Tuesday that they would request a &quot; vote of closing of debate &quot; for the law Dre@@ am Act , the reason why the initiative of leg@@ alizing und@@ oc@@ um@@ ented students could be voted next Thursday in the Sen@@ ate , although next week is more prob@@ able .
The sen@@ at@@ orial version of the Dre@@ am Act or law of the American Dre@@ am would leg@@ alize about 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16 ; they have remained in the country the last five years and entered either higher education institution or the army .
But those in favour require 60 votes for appro@@ ving the initiative , thus requiring the participation of re@@ public@@ ans , when the supporting organizations of the project carry out intense lob@@ b@@ ying to guarantee its approval .
The democ@@ rats , most of which support the Dre@@ am Act , count on 58 seats .
Nevertheless at least one of them , the sen@@ ator Ben N@@ elson from Neb@@ ras@@ ka , has said that he will vote against , and only a re@@ public@@ an has expressed his support to the law , Richard Lu@@ gar from Indi@@ ana .
For this reason , those in favour of the Dre@@ am Act require gathering several re@@ public@@ ans in case other democ@@ rats decide to turn the back to the initiative .
Among the most assisted re@@ public@@ ans are the sen@@ ators of Ma@@ ine , Olymp@@ ia S@@ no@@ we and Sus@@ an Coll@@ ins , as well as the sen@@ ator George L@@ emi@@ eux , of Florida , who completed the mandate of the sen@@ ator M@@ el Mart@@ ine@@ z .
Other re@@ public@@ ans who supported the Dre@@ am Act in the past are Or@@ r@@ in Hat@@ ch , from U@@ t@@ ah , and K@@ ay Bai@@ ley H@@ ut@@ ch@@ inson , from Texas , but they have declared that they will not turn their back again .
Another re@@ public@@ an who was in favour , John Mc@@ C@@ ain , has not defined his position at this moment .
Although the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives has a different version , an@@ alyst@@ s agree that the Dre@@ am Act faces the major obstacles in the Sen@@ ate .
With Liter@@ ature they can put their finger on it
The second round of The pleas@@ ures of language was a walk over which the participants en@@ acted the nar@@ r@@ ation
That of sex in language I understand that but ... the finger on it ? What am I expected to do ? , in@@ quired the writer Lu@@ is@@ a invited Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela invited to open the second round of The pleas@@ ures of the language , event that celeb@@ rates Liter@@ ature in Spanish and which this time used the sub@@ title of her question ( in another way the round table was dedicated to sex in the language , she explained ) .
The finger on it ... &quot; it puts us in a difficult position , &quot; told swe@@ et@@ ly straight out the Argent@@ ine writer to the public , mainly of young people , who met in the International Fair of the Book of Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara ( F@@ IL ) to listen to this round table moder@@ ated by Mar@@ is@@ ol Sh@@ ult@@ z and participated Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela , Ser@@ gio Ram@@ i@@ rez , May@@ ra Monter@@ o and Lu@@ is Gar@@ cia Monter@@ o all participated .
Lu@@ is@@ a Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela read a text that she dedicated to Gonz@@ al@@ o Cel@@ orio and that Sh@@ ult@@ z would define later as a great story , with Lu@@ is@@ a in first person as the prot@@ agon@@ ist who in search of knowledge known as &quot; it , &quot; goes from doctor to doctor , from whom she does not obtain answers although gets stuck in the same nar@@ r@@ ative thread .
She leaves the doctor convinced : &quot; perhaps pati@@ ence is not my for@@ te , maybe it is my s@@ ore . &quot;
In the end , after a frustr@@ ating approach with the trau@@ ma doctor who who clari@@ fies that s@@ ore isn &apos;t a scientific term ; it is the psycho@@ analy@@ st who un@@ ra@@ vels the myst@@ ery : &quot; the s@@ ore is the real open thing ; the symbolic thing is the scar . &quot;
The prot@@ agon@@ ist si@@ gh@@ ed allevi@@ ated and concluded &quot; on the s@@ ore I only managed to know that the real thing is open and that it does not exist , &quot; but convinced that the pleas@@ ures and the tri@@ cks of the language have to be mixed .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela , the writer , played with both .
The Nic@@ ar@@ agu@@ an Ser@@ gio Ram@@ i@@ rez also exhi@@ bited a delightful nar@@ r@@ ation that ti@@ tled Pra@@ ise of the inv@@ ention , where the finger on the s@@ ore isn &apos;t named but is discovered .
In broad terms of magical realis@@ m , he tells the story of a famous wit@@ ch , who by tou@@ ching clou@@ ds , brought back men who had gone far away or re@@ paired the virtu@@ es lost by a ma@@ id , nar@@ r@@ ation that turned into speaking about America , a great novel which didn &apos;t lack from the very beginning its own chron@@ ic@@ lers who told it and mentioned Bern@@ al Di@@ az del Cas@@ till@@ o who critici@@ zes the exc@@ esses of the things told by the con@@ qu@@ ering cap@@ tains .
Cer@@ v@@ antes who invented us all ( the writers ) lau@@ gh@@ ed of the false witn@@ esses who appeared in hi@@ stories presented as real , but otherwise he would have never told the history of America with imagination which lack sh@@ yn@@ ess .
Nevertheless , he empha@@ sized &quot; cra@@ zy people and li@@ ars are those who best imagine things &quot; and it is where reality and fal@@ seh@@ ood are mixed , where one knows if the nar@@ rated thing belongs to one side or another , where the fic@@ tional Liter@@ ature reaches its apo@@ gee .
In fact it is named &quot; Cer@@ v@@ antes tradition .
&quot; For its philosophy of : we are what &apos;s told of us . &quot;
As for her , the writer May@@ ra Monter@@ o saw and appl@@ au@@ ded the variety of interpre@@ tations that the invitation of F@@ IL causes with her round table The finger on the s@@ ore .
The Cub@@ an-@@ Puerto Ric@@ an pointed her own towards the great s@@ ore of the social violence that cross@@ es her country - and divi@@ des Latin America -@@ product of the disputes on traffic and drug sale .
I believe that good Liter@@ ature , good po@@ etry , good songs lock up a tac@@ it commitment that of course is not pre@@ medi@@ t@@ ated , indicated , after mentioning that the reality of Liter@@ ature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that sett@@ les down between author and readers , and that is one &quot; chemical reaction &quot; of this last one .
The night was closed by the Spanish po@@ et Lu@@ is Gar@@ cia Monter@@ o whose intervention also put emphasis &quot; that the finger on the s@@ ore of the writer committed to writing . &quot;
He considered that in a world that lives in a hur@@ ry , also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that it has effects in do@@ gm@@ atis@@ ms , for@@ getting &quot; that behind each affir@@ mation there is a small no and behind each neg@@ ation there is small yes . &quot;
&quot; In order to be owners of our thought and reality we must clarify : and clarify often means to put the finger on the s@@ ore and to bo@@ ther those people who are much more comfortable thinking about the car@@ to@@ on , in black and white , in ideas established without a sha@@ de and also bo@@ ther@@ ing to the powers that prefer a black and white world , &quot; he said , inviting to recover the sense of writing .
Rom@@ ano goes towards his first title
Rub@@ én Roman Om@@ ar counts with three defe@@ ats in the fin@@ als , having during his career ups and down@@ s , but he knew how to reach in three occasions the decisive series .
With the du@@ el of San@@ tos Lag@@ una and Monter@@ rey in the final , in addition two different styles marked by their techni@@ cians &apos; face , who find each other with a contrast marked by results .
Rub@@ én Roman Om@@ ar counts with three defe@@ ats in the fin@@ als , having during his career ups and down@@ s , but he knew how to reach on three occasions the decisive series , although until now he ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t reached the target and this is why this opportunity is very special for him .
The Argent@@ in@@ ean has ended up being con@@ sol@@ ed with the med@@ al of run@@ n@@ er-@@ up , and remained one step behind the winners and pec@@ uli@@ arly with similar equipment he has played consec@@ utive fin@@ als .
San@@ tos arrived to his first final as tra@@ iner in the Op@@ ening Mat@@ ch of 2002 , when he took the re@@ ins of Mor@@ el@@ ia with which he fell to 4-@@ 2 before Tol@@ u@@ ca ; later , in the C@@ losing Event of 2003 he also arrived at the decisive du@@ el and he lost also it at 3-@@ 1 and indeed before R@@ ay@@ ados .
Already with San@@ tos Lag@@ una , in the B@@ ic@@ ent@@ enni@@ al Mat@@ ch of 2010 , again before Los Di@@ ab@@ los , Rub@@ én suff@@ ers again a reverse , since his team finished equally places 2-@@ 2 before the s@@ aus@@ age makers after 2@@ 10 minutes of game , but in the turn of penalties put himself in advantage by 3-@@ 1 with two opportunities to seal the title but finally three players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the change 4-@@ 3 .
Rub@@ én already lost two fin@@ als with Di@@ ab@@ los Ro@@ j@@ os and one with Monter@@ rey , its ri@@ val in turn , therefore he doesn &apos;t want to end@@ ure the same fate , he wants to celebrate a title for the first time , and he affir@@ ms that the most important thing for him is the institution .
I want be a champion , I do not want break any statis@@ tic , this is for a club , for a passion and consequently the title will come to me , but the previous thing is more important , comm@@ ented the hel@@ m@@ sman when being ques@@ tioned about the numbers he has against by playing fin@@ als .
Very effective he has the previous final , from which , he ass@@ ures , has learned much , &quot; the only lesson we can learn is that until the refer@@ ee signals the end we cannot celebrate , we prepare ourselves as well as the players because the previous time , with two penalties we were about to leave and I believe that is an lesson to be learned , we cannot celebrate until the game ends . &quot;
Know@@ ing that this series could be defined in penalty k@@ ic@@ ks , something that doesn &apos;t trouble him , because he tru@@ sts his players : &quot; One should never looks for going to penalties , but rather to finish in regular time ; sometimes you don &apos;t have any alternative and it is necessary to be ready ; in the previous match we were prepared , unfortunately dest@@ iny played into our hands ; sometimes by ner@@ ves or anx@@ i@@ ety for having the title in out hands , but we didn &apos;t reach this goal , and this left us something for this final that we hope to win . &quot;
Roman should stop being a technical run@@ n@@ er-@@ up and ta@@ sting for the first time the gl@@ ory that the titles give .
EU changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Applic@@ ants will have to go to the centres of Att@@ end@@ ance for Visa Applic@@ ants before their interview in the Cons@@ ular Section ; the cost will be smaller and so will waiting times .
From the 10th of January of 2011 the procedure of issuing a visa in the Em@@ bass@@ y of the United States and consul@@ ates will be altered .
With the new procedure , the majority of applicants will have to go to the attend@@ ance centres for Visa Applic@@ ants ( AS@@ C , by its English ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ) prior to their interview in the Cons@@ ular Section .
The AS@@ C staff will take the biom@@ etric information of the applicant , which will be reviewed by the Cons@@ ular Section before the interview .
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants , among which :
The total cost of issuing the visa will be smaller ; it will no longer be necessary to make a payment in order to get the appointment , another payment to process the visa request and another one so that the service of correspon@@ dence gives the document .
The applicant will make only one payment which will cover the three services .
The present tariff will remain un@@ changed : the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa , 150 dollars for cases of visas with request ( including visas for temporary workers ) and 3@@ 90 dollars for visas of retail@@ ers and investors .
People who wish to rene@@ w their visa won &apos;t have to go to an interview with the Cons@@ ular Official , but they will only have to go to the nearest AS@@ C where they will present their documents and will have finger@@ prints taken .
Because the biom@@ etric information will be taken in the AS@@ C , the applicants who require a second date for being inter@@ viewed in the Cons@@ ular Section will attend one less time than previously .
Also , those requesting a visa in the Consul@@ ates of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez , Monter@@ rey and Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo will no longer pay the extra tariff on service of 26 dollars .

N@@ ASA will announce the discovery ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life
The American space agency called the press tomorrow to present a discovery that will cause impact in the search of living beings in the space .
The National Administration for Space and Aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics ( N@@ ASA ) of the United States will present tomorrow , Thursday , an astro@@ biological discovery , that could prove the theory that there is ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life .
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13 : 00 PM at N@@ ASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astro@@ bi@@ ology ; a science described as the one that studies the origin , evolution , distribution and future of the life in the Uni@@ verse .
When calling the press , N@@ ASA assured that it will present &quot; a discovery that will cause impact in the search of ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al life , &quot; which prov@@ oked speculation by experts in other countries .
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures that look like us living in hosti@@ le spaces that are thought of as un@@ inhab@@ itable , and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve their living conditions .
Appar@@ ently it is cent@@ red around a micro@@ be that was found at the bottom of the Mon@@ key Lake in the National Park Yo@@ sem@@ ite , California , where it lives in an environment that was considered too po@@ ison@@ ous for any form of life , since the lake is rich in ar@@ sen@@ ic .
Som@@ ehow , the creature uses ar@@ sen@@ ic as a means of survival and out of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other plan@@ ets that do not have our ben@@ evol@@ ent environment .
According to astro@@ bi@@ ologists , if these organisms use ar@@ sen@@ ic in their met@@ aboli@@ sm , it will be demonstrated that &quot; indeed there is another form of life , a second form of life , different from the one we know . &quot;
The space agency will present the full extent of the dis@@ cover@@ ies in the press conference of tomorrow Thursday .
P@@ am@@ ela Con@@ rad , who studies the possibility of life in Mars ; and the bi@@ ologist St@@ even B@@ enn@@ er , one of the scientists who study Titan ( the greater Satur@@ n moon ) , under the perspective that its chem@@ istry is similar to the one of the Earth will both attend the conference .
Gest@@ a PR@@ D , PT , Conver@@ gen@@ cia and Pat@@ ron oppon@@ ent &quot; block &quot;
With reforms to the Organ@@ ic law of Congress , a &quot; two-@@ party system &quot; emerg@@ es , they say .
The 60 Leg@@ islat@@ ure wasn &apos;t settled when a competing block aro@@ se in congress , headed by the dep@@ u@@ ties of the PR@@ D , PT , Conver@@ gen@@ cia and Jesus Manuel Pat@@ ron Mon@@ tal@@ vo , who declared himself as independent , and the four ques@@ tioned one thing : the arrival of the &quot; two-@@ party system &quot; to the Cam@@ era .
Before beginning the session establishing the 60 Leg@@ islat@@ ure , Feli@@ pe Man@@ z@@ an@@ are@@ z Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , from Conver@@ gen@@ cia ; E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Re@@ y@@ no@@ so E@@ spar@@ za , from the PT ; J@@ avier Cor@@ ver@@ a Qu@@ ev@@ edo , from the PR@@ D ; and Pat@@ ron Mon@@ tal@@ vo , were against the reform of the Stat@@ ut@@ ory law , given that it excluded them .
With this reform , they reiter@@ ated , will begin &apos; the two-@@ party system , &quot; because now there will be two representatives and an equal number of parties , that will control the Congress .
These four dep@@ u@@ ties , along with Gl@@ oria Margar@@ ita San@@ tos A@@ guil@@ ar , coordin@@ ator of the PR@@ D , were the only ones to vote against the Directive T@@ able , headed by the P@@ AN suppor@@ ter Salvador L@@ op@@ ez Bri@@ to and Lu@@ is Antonio Car@@ den@@ as Fon@@ sec@@ a , in his character of vic@@ e-@@ president .
Cor@@ ver@@ a Qu@@ ev@@ edo , detailed that these reforms institution@@ ally constitute the political margin@@ ality from the PR@@ I and P@@ AN .
He detailed that in the near future they will speak with the representatives of P@@ AN and PR@@ I to modify the scheme , starting from a political will , and if they do not have it , then they will be dominated once again by both parties and in this way the competing coalition was brought to a close .
How far they have got ( the competing coalition ) , is what I see , because we are excluded , from any decision , they don &apos;t even have the political de@@ ference of considering the opinion of the rest .
Feli@@ pe Man@@ z@@ an@@ are@@ z Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , from Conver@@ gen@@ cia , mentioned that with the PR@@ D , PT and Pat@@ ron , there are coinci@@ den@@ ces and for that reason they are forming a pl@@ ural group .
It is not possible to allow , he continued , that the Congress after having been mon@@ opoli@@ stic , now is a &quot; two-@@ party system . &quot;
&quot; It is not the spirit of the reform the law that has an et@@ ernal two-@@ party system in the Congress . &quot;
In order to begin , this group is initi@@ ating with 5 legislat@@ ors , and is talking with other compani@@ ons so that they could be more , added the conver@@ gent .
E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Re@@ y@@ no@@ so E@@ spar@@ za , from the PT , explained that at the moment the Congress became a &quot; pl@@ under &quot; between two , with reference to P@@ AN and PR@@ I . &quot;
Before it was only one party , now it is being divided between two . &quot;
Pat@@ ron Mon@@ tal@@ vo , asked for the personality of the dep@@ uty to be respected and to give him his place at the negotiation tables . &quot;
Not for leaders &apos; agreements , should be left outside 5 and probably we are going be 9 dep@@ u@@ ties , right now the five that we see , separated into different fra@@ c@@ tions , we have decided order to look for a slot in the negotiation table , that is the subject of the reforms reform that they have decided , we are outside and we do not agree to that reform . &quot;
200 $ thousand more for the provider
The City council of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án pays another check to the ques@@ tioned propri@@ et@@ or of the company of electrical equipment .
One more check of more than 200 thousand p@@ es@@ os in favour of Lor@@ ena Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e Cam@@ ach@@ o Pal@@ a@@ zu@@ el@@ os was issued by the City council .
With this , the amount that has been paid in this second sem@@ ester to the propri@@ et@@ or of the electrical equipment company , as@@ c@@ ends to 1 million 200 thousand p@@ es@@ os .
In agreement with the Mun@@ icip@@ ality transparency document , this last check number 9@@ 25@@ 8@@ 4@@ 47 was issued on 16th of November , with the amount of 200 thousand 14@@ 4,@@ 56 p@@ es@@ os , under the concept of &quot; liqui@@ dation of accounts to be paid . &quot;
The Treas@@ urer Lu@@ is Miguel L@@ op@@ ez Mor@@ eno had previously said that they were being paid more money by the Mun@@ icip@@ ality in favour of this supplier , that was observed by the Superior Audi@@ t of the State for selling to a higher price .
What wasn &apos;t reported is the total that still has to be paid and , therefore , how many checks have to be issued to Cam@@ ach@@ o Pal@@ a@@ zu@@ el@@ os .
Nothing has been bought , they simply pay the supplier the owned amounts , as the rest of providers , said in an interview .
The last checks &quot; appeared once again &quot; in the last quar@@ terly of the year : 24 of September , two issued on 15th of October , 19th of October , 29@@ th of October and this last one , on 16th of November .
Although the supplier has@@ n &apos;t been published yet in the Official Newsp@@ aper of the State , as the Law asks when a company is ques@@ tioned by ASE , in order to avoid that other governments use its services , the Treas@@ urer assured that they didn &apos;t use its services anymore .
Before , after the 25@@ th of July , when the Nor@@ o@@ este published a revision of the checks that the City council issues for its suppliers , in which it was revealed that , from March 2008 until 9th of July of 2010 , the tri@@ enni@@ um of the Mayor Jor@@ ge Ab@@ el L@@ op@@ ez San@@ che@@ z , the Mun@@ icip@@ ality paid to Cam@@ ach@@ o Pal@@ a@@ zu@@ el@@ os more than 10 million p@@ es@@ os , through 42 checks .
It also concluded transactions with Ju@@ ma@@ p@@ am , where received checks for more than 3 million p@@ es@@ os .
It is urgent that the tourist sites are taken care of
The tourist industri@@ alists feel sorry for the accident of the foreign tourist caused by bad conditions of the Gl@@ ori@@ eta San@@ che@@ z T@@ abo@@ ada in Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án .
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the down@@ -@@ fall of Gl@@ ori@@ eta San@@ che@@ z T@@ abo@@ ada , the tourist sector of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án asked the authorities to pay attention to the zones and sites that are in a bad state and that offer a bad image of the port .
Salvador Bar@@ ra@@ za Ru@@ bi@@ o , president of the Association of Ret@@ ail@@ ers of the Zone Dor@@ ada , remembered that in different occasions they have den@@ ounced that the image of the dest@@ iny should be taken care of and to change the bad perc@@ ep@@ tions that the tourists might find with new activities or routes .
He said that the bad conditions of the streets and the si@@ de-@@ walks have affected because the tourists come to take a walk and see the dis@@ order and they avoid the complementary businesses .
The politicians do not know what it means to close for one day and do not have any idea about the amount of money that is lost , or otherwise they w@@ ouldn &apos;t do the jobs this way in such a long period of time and without previous planning .
The hotel@@ ke@@ eper J@@ ose Ram@@ on Man@@ gu@@ art San@@ che@@ z said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the part of the City council .
&quot; The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and to avoid this happening again , by giving preventive maintenance and not doing only the correction , &quot; he said .
We look forward to enjoying a clean city , because not only must the area be given the maintenance , but as inhabitants who deserve a clean site to live on ; the City council must change its strategy in order to maintain good living and visiting conditions .
There are other sites that are also negl@@ ected and incomplete , he said , as for example El Es@@ cu@@ do and the Ven@@ adi@@ to de Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án .
&quot; Nowadays , for the tourist to come does depend only by the promotion , we must have a good product , a city that has clean beaches and aven@@ ues , permanent maintenance of the attraction areas , &quot; he said .
&quot; There wasn &apos;t enough attention paid and this under@@ lines something that is well-known by all , that maintenance is a must . &quot;
Rau@@ l L@@ ler@@ a Mart@@ ine@@ z , secret@@ ary assi@@ stant of Tourist Pro@@ motion , expressed that the rescue of tourist sites of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án is urgent , because they are not enjoyed of a correct manner and they project a bad image .
He spoke of a series of places that has to al@@ ign altogether with the municipality and to be a priority having the city always , clean , ordin@@ ate and attractive because it is a tour@@ istic city .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be put in order first of all , cleaned and made attractive in order to be able to add them in the inventory when promoting the city .
IP requests results from the Congress
E@@ du@@ ardo D@@ á@@ val@@ os , president of the C@@ EC , proposed that the dep@@ u@@ ties assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sin@@ alo@@ a by the diverse challenges that faces .
A Leg@@ islat@@ ure of decent works and free from agreements between parties and the Executive state is being demanded by the enterprise sector of Ma@@ z@@ at@@ l@@ án , because there is a conv@@ ul@@ sed Sin@@ alo@@ a that faces great problems .
Yesterday the 60 legislat@@ ure was voted in , integrated by seven political forces , 19 dep@@ u@@ ties of the PR@@ I , 13 of the P@@ AN , three of the Party Nu@@ eva Ali@@ anza , two of the PR@@ D , one of the PT , one of the Conver@@ gen@@ cia and one more of the PV@@ EM , meaning a total of 40 popular representatives .
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the S-@@ state it is mentioned that they come to fulfil a clean management of commitment to the society and the different sectors that require a responsible legislative work .
E@@ du@@ ardo D@@ á@@ val@@ os Z@@ am@@ ora , president of the Enterprise Co@@ ordin@@ ating Council , proposed that the just released 40 dep@@ u@@ ties of the Congress of the State assumed the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sin@@ alo@@ a by the diverse challenges that faces .
We hope that the dep@@ u@@ ties will really exert their right , free from agreements between the parties because it is a custom to make agreements in order to guard by their own interests and they become a character in a car@@ ni@@ val of the govern@@ ors and leaders of the parliamentary fra@@ c@@ tions .
For that reason he spoke about certi@@ fying the commitment in order to establish the necessary bridges that could help the Govern@@ or to go ahead .
We hope that they come to do a worthy work and mainly committed to the society and the sectors because the habit@@ ants of Sin@@ alo@@ a were those who gave them the vote of confidence during the last elections .
J@@ ose Ram@@ on Man@@ gu@@ art San@@ che@@ z , president of the Association of Hotels Tr@@ es Is@@ las , considered that one of the greatest challenges for the 40 popular representatives is the one of pushing and adding forces in search of the economic growth of the state , because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated .
The most important thing is to push economic growth , that generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will form a new generation of jobs .
As for the tourist activity , he demanded that the new legislat@@ ors give the weight revised within the state budget in order to forti@@ fy the Secretary of Tourism .
As I have understood this is the second department of the state with fewer budgets and is in@@ con@@ gru@@ ous an important and economic activity generating currencies and investment and that directly compet@@ es with the ag@@ ro industry .
Apart from requiring labelling resources the det@@ on@@ ating tourist projects that help giving security to the state and update the Al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Law that has not been able to solve in the previous legislat@@ ures .
A mag@@ ici@@ an is looked for
D@@ olls , cars and bicy@@ cles , among others toys , are the year@@ ning of the children of the family Cor@@ on@@ ado from Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
For his parents , the next Day of K@@ ings will be difficult to please his illu@@ sions , since their home is made out of no more than 12 people and a go@@ at .
Nevertheless , Adel@@ ai@@ da , Is@@ abel , Jesus , J@@ ose Al@@ fre@@ do , Maria Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e , I@@ sa@@ i@@ as , J@@ ose Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Mel@@ cher , G@@ asp@@ ar and Bal@@ th@@ az@@ ar will give them the toys and clothes they so much wish .
The family lives in a hum@@ ble house of the Col@@ ony Salvador All@@ ende and lives in poor conditions because the father does not have a job .
Sometimes it is very hard for us because my husband does not have a job , but we sell mand@@ arin and d@@ ad@@ dy ... in the afternoon I leave with the kids to sell in the street , &quot; said C@@ ay@@ et@@ ana Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela An@@ dra@@ de , mother of the children .
Adel@@ ai@@ da , 4 years old , wants a d@@ oll or a bicycle , while her sister Is@@ abel , 3 years old , would like a Bar@@ b@@ ie d@@ oll .
On the other hand , J@@ ose Al@@ fre@@ do , 10 years old , has wished for a very long time to have a &quot; mon@@ ster &quot; car and for his brother Jesus , 8 months old , C@@ ay@@ et@@ ana suggests clothes suitable for a one year baby .
He told me ( J@@ ose Al@@ fre@@ do ) , I would like this mon@@ ster , &quot; but I said &quot; we will see son &quot; because it was very expensive , &quot; remembered C@@ ay@@ et@@ ana with s@@ ad@@ ness .
For the el@@ der children that were at school clothes and shoes would be perfect .
Maria Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e , 11 years old , is size 12 ; I@@ sa@@ i@@ as , 10 years old , is size 10 , whereas Miguel , 8 years old , uses size eight .
J@@ ose Juan , 14 years old , needs tennis , reason why a pair of size five and a half or six would helpful to him .
If you want to make this dream come true for the children of the Cor@@ on@@ ado family from Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela you can participate in the campaign as there is a need for a Mag@@ ici@@ an , by don@@ ating a to@@ y or cash at the reception of the Nor@@ o@@ este .
14 presum@@ ed drug traff@@ ick@@ ers arrested
Ten se@@ arches were carried out in E@@ stri@@ e on Wednesday in the context of dismant@@ ling a network of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is production and sale .
Four@@ teen persons were arrested and will face various charges
The se@@ arches took place at Sher@@ bro@@ o@@ ke , Oxford and Sto@@ ke , mostly in the places which served for the production of drugs
&quot; Ap@@ proxim@@ ately 750 c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is plants , 4 ki@@ lo@@ gramm@@ es of h@@ ash@@ ish , money and equipment which served for production were sei@@ zed &quot; stated K@@ Lou@@ is-@@ Phili@@ ppe Ru@@ el , spo@@ kes@@ man of the Qu@@ eb@@ ec S@@ û@@ ré@@ té .
In all , el@@ even men and three women were arrested , including two presum@@ ed heads of this network , two Sher@@ bro@@ o@@ ke men .
The arrested persons had to appear at Sher@@ boo@@ ke Court during the hours following their arrest
They might face accus@@ ation of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is production , its possession with the object of trafficking pl@@ ot@@ ting , and th@@ eft among other things
These se@@ arches took place following a lengthy inquiry lasting almost a year .
&quot; It was information received from the public which enabled us to make these arres@@ ts &quot; stated M. Ru@@ el .
Some 70 police officers from the reg@@ inal en@@ quiry unit of the E@@ stri@@ e of the Qu@@ eb@@ ec S@@ û@@ ret@@ é , of the police department o Sher@@ bro@@ o@@ ke and Nep@@ hr@@ é@@ ma@@ go@@ g police head@@ q@@ ur@@ ters took part in this police operation .
C@@ land@@ est@@ ine migration can be pursued without prob@@ ems
According to the government , the conserv@@ atives &apos; draft law should solve the problem of bo@@ at@@ loads of illegal migrants , but will in all prob@@ ability be defe@@ ated , since the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it .
&quot; I strongly rely on the Charter . &quot;
&quot; I support ther party , which created the gran@@ ite ben@@ e@@ ath your feet &quot; declared the liberal chief Michael Ign@@ ati@@ ef@@ f , surrounded by dep@@ u@@ ties after the weekly c@@ auc@@ us meeting .
The liber@@ als claim that the draft law in its present form which would an@@ able any person from a ship identified as carrying c@@ land@@ est@@ ine immigrants , would viol@@ ate the Canadian charter of rights and liber@@ ties .
The chief of the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Block , Gil@@ les Du@@ cep@@ pe has also said that he could not support the draft law , because its aim is wrong .
&quot; We are opposed and it appears that all the opposition parties are opposed and we will now see what the government does &quot; declared M. Du@@ cep@@ e
The cri@@ tic of N@@ P@@ D concerning immigration , Oli@@ via C@@ how , has rejected the out of hand the criticisms st@@ ati@@ gn that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants .
&quot; the neo-@@ democ@@ rats approve the taking of steps against persons handling illegal immigrants and this is what we are doing by means of another draft law , the C-@@ 35 &quot; stated M@@ me C@@ how .
&quot; We do not support the Conserv@@ atives &apos; draft law because it attacks refugees and impris@@ ons their children for at least a year , &quot; explained M@@ me C@@ how .
The Minister of Im@@ migration . Jas@@ on Ken@@ ney , accused the opposition parties of playing politics and of ign@@ oring the will of Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Canadi@@ ans are telling dep@@ u@@ ties loud and clear that they will not toler@@ ate this kind of illegal immigration , these criminal operations which target Canada and which treat the country like a door@@ m@@ at . &quot;
&quot; They expect Canada to adopt firm measures &quot; was the reaction of Minister Ken@@ ney .
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on the draft law , which could bring about elections in the event of its rejection .
A Conserv@@ ative has however told the Q@@ M@@ I Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposed dep@@ uty shall explain his reasons to his elec@@ tors .
The new unity does not create unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Char@@ est of the possible creation of a permanent unit for combating corruption and coll@@ u@@ sion , numerous observers continue to demand the creation of a commission of public inquiry into the subject .
The Minister of Public Security , Rob@@ rt Du@@ til , asser@@ ts that this idea is not new : Qu@@ eb@@ ec consulted the New York Department of Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ation on the subject last January .
The metro@@ polis has had a permanent anti-@@ corruption unit since 18@@ 70 .
Nevertheless , the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one person .
It must be said that at a m@@ meeting of the Qu@@ eb@@ ec permanent police council last 29 October this step was never discussed , not@@ with@@ standing the presence of Robert Du@@ til .
It did not need any more than that the public security cri@@ tic Steph@@ ane Ber@@ ger@@ on should call this announcement a &quot; rab@@ bit produced out of the hat &quot; and as &quot; a solution thrown together on the corner of a table &quot;
Minister Du@@ til rep@@ lied to those fear@@ ing that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unit .
&quot; You will see the result when it is announced , he cont@@ ented himself with affir@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; One is aware of that problem . &quot;
As far as the president of the C@@ SQ , Ré@@ j@@ ean Par@@ ent is concerned , nothing can replace the launch of a public inquiry .
&quot; The more obst@@ in@@ ately M.@@ Char@@ est ref@@ uses to create this commission of inquiry , the more people will think like you and I that there is something to be hidden , &quot; he explains .
&quot; The only way to get a commission of inquiry is for Jean Char@@ est to res@@ ign &quot; explains Y@@ ves Bo@@ is@@ ver@@ t , Professor of Eth@@ ics and Government at the E@@ col@@ e Nationale d &apos;@@ Administration Pub@@ li@@ que
In order to get out of this imp@@ asse he therefore suggests that Qu@@ eb@@ ec should give a special mandate to the General Veri@@ fier for the latter to inqu@@ ire into coll@@ u@@ sion and corruption .
&quot; One must be able to bro@@ aden the mandate of the General Veri@@ fier , &quot; he decides .
He also feels that Qu@@ eb@@ ec could con@@ fer on the Veri@@ fier the same powers as those of a commission@@ er , allowing the former to comp@@ el people to t@@ esti@@ fy .
The creation of a permanent group of people is not the only project on the Char@@ est government programme .
Qu@@ eb@@ ec would also ask Ot@@ ta@@ wa to modify the criminal code , to make it more suitable for this type of crime .
This request would come from the prosec@@ utor of the Mar@@ te@@ au operation , who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-@@ Marc Four@@ nier that precedent is not explicit on this type of inquiry .
The Federal Minister of Public Security , V@@ ic To@@ e@@ ws confirmed that his colleague at Justice , R@@ ob Nich@@ ol@@ son is currently inc@@ lined to introduce certain amendments .
At the time of the Spring 2001 operation , which targeted groups of motor cy@@ cli@@ sts , even though the criminal code had not been adapted , 18@@ 1 persons were arrested ..
Ot@@ ta@@ wa subsequently ruled to adopt the law on gang@@ ster@@ ism
Ri@@ vers under close surveillance
Several water courses continue to be under close surveillance due to the heavy ra@@ ins falling in several regions of the province since Tuesday
A land slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Sha@@ win@@ ig@@ an in Ma@@ uri@@ tia .
Two houses were ev@@ acu@@ ated as a precau@@ tion .
In the evening another land slide occurred at Saint-@@ Lin@@ -@@ Laur@@ enti@@ des in Len@@ audi@@ ère .
A road collap@@ sed .
Between Tuesday and Wednesday evening heavy rain ( from 40 to 70 milli@@ metres ) fell in several regions .
Between 20 and 40 milli@@ metres of additional rain were expected between now and Thursday evening depending on region .
Sec@@ tors north of the river and in Out@@ a@@ ou@@ ais al@@ ley were worst affected .
They received a total of up to 100 milli@@ metres of rain .
Since these falls will be added to the th@@ a@@ wing of snow already lying in certain sectors , the over@@ f@@ lowing of several rivers is fear@@ ed .
F@@ lood al@@ er@@ ts were issued on Wednesday evening by Qu@@ eb@@ ec Civil Security for the rivers O@@ u@@ are@@ au and Ach@@ ig@@ an in Len@@ audi@@ ère .
The rivers Nord in Saint Jer@@ ô@@ me , in the Laur@@ enti@@ des and Ch@@ è@@ ne in Lot@@ bin@@ i@@ ère were the object of flood war@@ nings and remained under surveillance .
In the Lan@@ audi@@ ère region , heavy ra@@ ins caused the over@@ f@@ lowing of certain lakes at Sa@@ int@@ e-@@ Juli@@ enne , Sa@@ int@@ e-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ in@@ e-@@ de-@@ Kil@@ dare , as well as at Ra@@ w@@ don .
At Sa@@ int@@ e-@@ C@@ ali@@ x@@ te , a pro@@ visi@@ onal bridge was sw@@ ept away by heavy ra@@ ins .
Ten d@@ well@@ ings had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated as a precau@@ tion .
In the Out@@ a@@ ou@@ ais , the over@@ f@@ lowing of certain lakes ent@@ ailed the closure of several roads , in particular in the municipality of Man@@ s@@ fiel@@ d-@@ et-@@ P@@ ont@@ ef@@ ra@@ ct .
An@@ nik Bou@@ ch@@ ard , a security consult@@ ant , stated that Civil Security continued to be in a state of alert and was monitoring the situation closely .
On Wednesday , Qu@@ eb@@ ec F@@ lood For@@ ec@@ ast Centre issued flood war@@ nings in respect of several rivers , in particular Mas@@ kin@@ ong@@ é , Ass@@ omp@@ tion , O@@ u@@ are@@ au , L &apos;@@ Ach@@ ig@@ an , B@@ atis@@ can and Lou@@ p .
Dup@@ ont partly bl@@ amed
The Qu@@ eb@@ ec radio anim@@ ator St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Dup@@ ont suffered a partial reverse before the Canadian Radio and Tel@@ evision Standards Council ( C@@ CN@@ R ) on the subject of social assistance and Hai@@ ti@@ ans , as well as on that of his co@@ ar@@ se language whilst on air .
T@@ ne CN@@ N@@ R feels that M. Dup@@ ont and his team of CH@@ O@@ I 9@@ 8,@@ 1 F@@ M had the right to express their views , but that certain topics contained &quot; in@@ exact information on social assistance , un@@ duly negative statements concerning Hai@@ ti@@ ans and co@@ ar@@ se language not suitable for day@@ time broad@@ casts . &quot;
The Council also concluded that a discussion about suicide including the broadcasting of the names of two persons who had committed suicide , did not infrin@@ ge broadcasting codes .
The C@@ CN@@ R had received several complaints on the subject of comments made during bra@@ d@@ casts between 2008 and 2010 .
The first decision was given following a complaint by the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Common Front of persons receiving social assistance .
The group compl@@ ained that the sums quoted in the broad@@ casts were not accurate .
The anim@@ ators must present solid , not dec@@ ep@@ tive information .
Conc@@ erning suicide , the anim@@ ator Steph@@ ane Dup@@ ont felt that suicide was the action of a co@@ ward .
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the message conve@@ yed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution of life &apos;s problems .
&quot; The majority of the Committee feels that the epis@@ odes in question of &quot; Dup@@ ont mid@@ day &quot; appro@@ ached a delicate subject in a balanced and appropriate manner . &quot;
Accordingly , no blame attached to him .
The last dispute concerned the declarations which followed the Haiti earthquake .
St@@ é@@ ph@@ ane Dup@@ ont and Jean-@@ Ren@@ é Du@@ fort then had a fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face media discussion , which gave rise to a lot of reactions .
The CH@@ O@@ I anim@@ ator declared that he had not made any contribution to help the Hai@@ ti@@ ans , because one could not be certain that the people in need really would receive the money .
The Committee believes that the comments were not impro@@ per , but that their cum@@ ulative effect concerning Hai@@ ti@@ ans was un@@ duly negative .
&quot; I have already served my three-@@ day suspension there . &quot;
&quot; My record has now been clean for eigh@@ teen months , &quot; declared the anim@@ ator .
In all its decisions the Committee condem@@ ns the broadcasting of co@@ ar@@ se language .
The broad@@ c@@ aster CH@@ O@@ I@@ -F@@ N collabor@@ ated &quot; beyond the call of duty &quot; in all cases .
The consequences are minimal for the station which must , inter al , announce these decisions once during the hours of maximum audience within three days .
The king of k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu in Montreal
The Montreal resident of Algeri@@ an origin , N@@ ac@@ er@@ ed@@ dine Z@@ em@@ mal , has an extremely individual programme .
The ath@@ l@@ ete , who exc@@ els at &quot; s@@ anda &quot; ( &quot; full contact &quot; k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu ) , at k@@ ick@@ box@@ ing and at Thai box@@ ing , is entering the tat@@ ami and the rings of the world in search of fresh chall@@ an@@ ges .
&quot; I started practi@@ sing mar@@ ti@@ al arts such as k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu and k@@ ick@@ box@@ ing 12 years ago in Algeria , &quot; explained Z@@ em@@ mal who has lived in the capital since 2008 in order to train with professionals .
&quot; In my case I look for fi@@ ghts everywhere , since for those who do not like the floor fi@@ ghts present in mixed mar@@ ti@@ al arts , competitions in North America are rare . &quot;
Recently , the man working as security agent for the UPS company , had bad news for his ri@@ vals , having gained two gold med@@ als in the am@@ ateur world champ@@ ionship of the World Kar@@ ate and K@@ ick@@ box@@ ing Association ( W@@ K@@ A ) held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh in Scotland .
&quot; I won in the classes of full contact k@@ ick@@ box@@ ing and Thai box@@ ing , &quot; he explained .
&quot; I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Sh@@ ou World Cup . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ peti@@ tors who finished among the first four zt the preced@@ ing world champ@@ ionship in each class , were invited . &quot;
&quot; In Tor@@ onto in 2009 I won the bron@@ ze med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; In Vietnam in 2005 , I finished ei@@ g@@ th . &quot;
&quot; I finished fifth in the 2007 tournament in China and third in Tor@@ onto in 2009 , &quot; he added .
&quot; What is interesting is that I did better at each competition . &quot;
&quot; At this rate I will be first this year , or next ! &quot;
The &quot; san sh@@ ou &quot; or &quot; s@@ anda &quot; is an original Chinese contest , where pun@@ ches and k@@ ic@@ ks , as well as thro@@ wing to the ground is authorised .
The fi@@ ghts take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring .
The most famous pu@@ gi@@ list from this form of combat is the American of Vietnam@@ ese origin , C@@ ung Le , well known in the world of mar@@ ti@@ al arts .
If N@@ ac@@ er Z@@ em@@ mal is asked to recall only one event of his career , it will surely be his participation in the &quot; King of S@@ anda &quot; tournament in the k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu Super Bow@@ l .
&quot; This competition is the most often mentioned and the most prestigious in China , &quot; explained the agre@@ eable , stra@@ pping young man .
&quot; It is the equivalent of the L@@ ump@@ in@@ ee Stadium , ( the largest stadium in Thailand ) . &quot;
&quot; It was a super experience . &quot;
Z@@ em@@ mal won his first fight , a semi-@@ final in his class ( 80 kg ) , before losing in the fin@@ als .
&quot; The man who beat me was a real professional &quot; he analy@@ sed .
&quot; There are four figh@@ ters in each class ( 80 kg , 85 kg , 90 kg and 95 kg ) &quot;
&quot; The winners of the semi-@@ fin@@ als fight one another in the fin@@ als of their class . &quot;
&quot; The winners in each class fight one another for the title of a si@@ gle champion , the king of k@@ ung@@ -@@ fu . &quot;
450 mili@@ on &apos; worth of contracts without calls for tender
Hydro@@ -@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec awarded 450 million dollars &apos; worth of contracts to engineering companies for the E@@ ast@@ main@@ -@@ 1-@@ A@@ -S@@ ar@@ cel@@ le-@@ Ru@@ per@@ t hydro@@ electric project .
At the core of this av@@ al@@ anche of over 100 contracts is a con@@ sortium formed by the companies B@@ PR . D@@ ess@@ au , S@@ N Group and Ax@@ or , which secured the most important one , that of managing the project for the sum of 2@@ 95 million dollars without a call for tender .
The con@@ sortium called Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce was formed in 2004 , leaving it to Hydro@@ -@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec at its option to pass its responsibility for managing this important hydro@@ electric project worth 5000 million dollars to the private sector .
At the beginning of 2005 the Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce con@@ sortium secured this lu@@ cr@@ ative contract without a prior public call for tender .
As far as the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Party is concerned , re@@ course to company con@@ sor@@ tia poses a serious problem , that of elimination of competition and of an increase of price .
&quot; This is the new way of coll@@ u@@ ding and defe@@ ating competition . &quot;
&quot; This means that rather than beh@@ aving sec@@ re@@ tively , people now beh@@ ave openly , &quot; declared the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Party dep@@ uty Sil@@ v@@ ain Sim@@ ard at a Press conference .
Ear@@ lier during the morning M. Sim@@ ard raised the question in the National Assembly , because he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in that way .
Re@@ pl@@ ying in the afternoon , the Minister of Natural Resour@@ ces N@@ ath@@ al@@ ie Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au , denied vigor@@ ously any coll@@ u@@ sion in connection with this contract .
&quot; I am starting my journey , &quot; she stor@@ med , maintaining that the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Party had been &quot; dish@@ on@@ est &quot; and &quot; lacking rig@@ our . &quot;
She said that &quot; it would be the least thing &quot; for the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Party to excuse itself .
The formula of the con@@ sor@@ tia is current practice throughout the world .
What is usually involved is an alliance limited over time , which allows two or more companies to combine their respective exper@@ ti@@ ses in order to respond to a call for tender for a complex project .
The E@@ ast@@ main project comprises a high level of complexity , taking into account the extent of the works .
The site is in progress and must extend until 2012 .
The contract was awarded without involving competition ; there were negotiations .
Likewise , the formula of con@@ sor@@ tia is no longer an exception in Qu@@ eb@@ ec , even in respect of relatively simple projects .
As was disclos@@ ed last week by Le Dev@@ o@@ ir , the formula of con@@ sor@@ tia in the engineering consultancy sector is the subject of a government inquiry .
A brief inspection of the register of Qu@@ eb@@ ec companies shows the exist@@ ece of over 200 con@@ sor@@ tia , some of which appear to be permanent .
So , for example , the Des@@ se@@ au company works in partnership with the majority of its principal competitors , including C@@ IM@@ A + , G@@ é@@ ni@@ var , S@@ N@@ C-@@ Lav@@ al@@ in and others such as Ro@@ che and T@@ ec@@ s@@ ult .
Every combination and there are tens of them , comes back to one and the same company , namely Des@@ se@@ au .
As far as the Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce con@@ sortium is concerned , Minister Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au stressed that &quot; the territory of the Ba@@ ie James comp@@ lies with the specific labour dynamics and that Hydro@@ -@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec has complied with them specifically since the nin@@ et@@ een s@@ even@@ ties . &quot;
The head of the E@@ ast@@ main project , Ré@@ al La@@ porte of the Soci@@ été d &apos;@@ én@@ ergie de la Ba@@ ie James ( SE@@ B@@ J ) gave an explanation , which raised ey@@ eb@@ rows about the fact that the project management contract had been awarded by mutual agreement .
&quot; If you launch a call for tender and if there are few ten@@ der@@ ers , your prices will be too high . &quot;
&quot; You have two options ; either you accept the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price . &quot; or you take the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfac@@ ti@@ ory alliance and a good price . &quot; we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price . &quot;
&quot; But the idea is that it is not the price which is imp@@ port@@ ant , but people &apos;s skills &quot; stated M. La@@ porte .
This contract awarded to the Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce con@@ sortium , forms part of a long list of contracts of over 50 000 $ secured by the Qu@@ eb@@ ec P@@ s@@ r@@ ty .
The contracts were awarded by Hydro@@ -@@ Qu@@ eb@@ ec or SE@@ B@@ J for the E@@ ast@@ main@@ -@@ 1-@@ A@@ -S@@ ar@@ cel@@ le-@@ Ru@@ per@@ t project .
Following verification , Le Dev@@ o@@ ir counted 10@@ 9 engineering consultancy contracts a@@ we@@ ar@@ ded between 2002 and 2010 to companies or to their subsidiaries , especially soil labor@@ atories .
S@@ N@@ C-@@ Lav@@ al@@ in grab@@ bed 22 contracts , G@@ é@@ ni@@ var 16 , T@@ ec@@ s@@ ult 14 and D@@ ess@@ au 10 , not counting its participation in E@@ ergie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce .
All the contracts were negotiated .
They total 4@@ 49 7@@ 83 3@@ 44 $ , including the contract awarded to Energie g@@ é@@ ran@@ ce worth 2@@ 95 13@@ 1 5@@ 64 $ .
Sy@@ lv@@ ain Sim@@ ard let it be known that the four companies comp@@ r@@ sing the con@@ sortium ( B@@ PR , D@@ ess@@ au , Group S@@ N and Ax@@ or ) are &quot; well known to Qu@@ eb@@ ec Liberal Party . &quot;
Minister Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au let sli@@ p that the Qu@@ eb@@ ec Party is also linked to these companies who &quot; finance &quot; it , before stating that it was rather its directors , who were involved .
Bar@@ ometer of the responsible consumption - the &quot; green &quot; label does not insp@@ ire confidence .
Gre@@ ener , but frank@@ ly scep@@ tical .
The Qu@@ eb@@ ec consumer has little confidence in dur@@ able development players , but also in equ@@ itable brands and in certificates claimed to be ecological , to guide his choice .
Wor@@ se , if he immer@@ ses himself in the universe of the media where messages in favour of more respon@@ si@@ be consumption pul@@ l@@ ulate , he depl@@ ores the lack of reliable information , a piece of negl@@ ect which he even describes as a bra@@ ke on his commitment , indicates the Bar@@ ometer of responsible consumption whose first reading took place today .
Even if they brought about an increase of consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010 , Qu@@ eb@@ ec inhabitants appear to have little faith in those who are trying to sell it to them .
Tw@@ o-@@ thirds among them say in effect that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies , or their green public@@ ity disc@@ losing the tool of measurement drawn up by the responsible consumption observ@@ atory of Sher@@ bro@@ o@@ ke University .
Another finding : Hal@@ f of consumers enter@@ tain doubts concerning the reliability of official certi@@ fications appearing on so-called equ@@ itable products , but also concerning the credibility of products and brands marked as eco-@@ responsible , indicates the Bar@@ ometer .
In the same v@@ ein , the talk of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.@@ 6 % of Qu@@ eb@@ ec inhabitants .
Nevertheless , information concerning responsible consumption appears to be fundamental for the stim@@ ulation of this kind of current consumption by two-@@ thirds of Qu@@ eb@@ ec inhabitants .
In fact , the vacuum and the doub@@ t@@ ful nature of the information would cool the ard@@ our of 46 % of consumers .
It is the second most important bra@@ ke after the higher price of these products identified by the Bar@@ ometer .
Moreover , two-@@ thirds of Qu@@ eb@@ ec inhabitants say that they mi@@ str@@ ust the alleged perform@@ am@@ ce of &quot; green &quot; products or services which are being placed in their hands .
On another note , in 2010 almost half the consumers had to change th@@ ir hab@@ its and most importantly to change the brand of one or more of their products , to reflect their conviction .
Up to 61 % of them thus favoured buying from their local shops and preferred foodstuffs grown in their region , indicate the Bar@@ ometer .
Gre@@ ener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Qu@@ eb@@ ec hom@@ o consum@@ us likes to appear as the king of recycling trying to reduce its environmental im@@ print by worrying about the protection of animals .
But its social and ecological conscience nevertheless appears to be restricted to the outside of its vehicle , indicates the Bar@@ ometer : in 2010 , scar@@ c@@ ely 28 % of Qu@@ eb@@ ec inhabitants stated that they used public transport or recommended its use in order to defend their green interests .
Walking and cycling were also supported by 19.@@ 1 % of participants in this huge ba@@ ha@@ vi@@ our@@ al inquiry .
A State loan for the purchase of the e@@ X@@ centr@@ is .
The Qu@@ eb@@ ec government which was asked to become financial involved in the purchase of the e@@ X@@ centr@@ is cinema complex by the Ang@@ us and Parall@@ el company , agrees to collabor@@ ate , but only in the form of a loan .
The Ang@@ us and Parall@@ el development company which hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to purchase from Daniel Lang@@ lo@@ is the cinema complex e@@ X@@ centr@@ is on bou@@ levard Saint-@@ Laur@@ ent , restoring to it its full cin@@ em@@ ap@@ hi@@ le vocation , will not secure what they are asking for .
The government agrees to become involved , but on its own conditions .
Rather than the expected donation , the Que@@ be government is offering a loan which will be less than initially expected and which could be a viable solution on advan@@ tage@@ ous conditions , at least according to State sources .
A first plan of action and a request for 12.@@ 8 million were already rejected by Qu@@ eb@@ ec last spring , but the requests have since been revised down@@ wards .
A proposal am@@ d an action plan were sent to Minister St@@ -@@ Pierre by the chairman of the Soci@@ été de@@ Dé@@ velop@@ p@@ ement des Ent@@ re@@ prises C@@ ultur@@ elles ( SO@@ D@@ EC ) Franç@@ ois N@@ ac@@ er@@ ola , who is pil@@ oting the e@@ X@@ cen@@ r@@ tic file .
He sent him a final report ten days ago .
But the counter@@ proposal of the cab@@ inet arrived at SO@@ D@@ EC on Tuesday .
Parall@@ è@@ le and Ang@@ us have until 31 December to reply to it .
It nevertheless appears that the assumption of a donation must really be abandoned .
Let us recall that the Associ@@ a@@ it@@ ons of Qu@@ eb@@ ec O@@ w@@ ners of Cin@@ em@@ as and C@@ ine@@ parks opposed direct State investment to assist the purchase of e@@ X@@ centr@@ is , argu@@ ing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects , which it did not do for other cin@@ em@@ as .
But several local players , on the other hand , claimed substantial economic help .
Daniel Lang@@ lo@@ is , the pre@@ vi@@ o@@ su owner , supported the author &apos;s cinema on the complex premises after having himself financed its construction , which was able to justify a wai@@ ver by the Treas@@ ury .
There is a cr@@ ying lack of halls for showing independent films in Montreal and e@@ X@@ centr@@ is knew how to gain the loy@@ alty of its customers .
The Ang@@ us Company and the Parall@@ el , headed by Christian Y@@ acc@@ ar@@ ini , are pil@@ oting a private financing campaign , hoping to collect 700 000 $ to make the acqu@@ is@@ it@@ on possible .
Since spring 2009 , one of the three screens , the Parall@@ el , continues to broadcast e@@ X@@ c@@ etr@@ is films .
The aim of future purch@@ as@@ ers is that of re@@ opening the three halls on 27 February , showing the very beautiful film by X@@ avier Beau@@ vo@@ is entitled &quot; Men and Go@@ ds . &quot;
But Cris@@ tian Y@@ acc@@ ar@@ ini has not called back Le Dev@@ o@@ ir and it is not known what he and his Group think about the proposals for a reduction , which have been made to them .
The v@@ eil li@@ fted on a complex Canada ....
The new American diplomatic c@@ ables di@@ vul@@ ged by Wiki@@ le@@ aks have li@@ fted the v@@ eil on what the United States consider to be an inf@@ eri@@ ority complex of Canadi@@ ans towards Americans , but they also betra@@ y a sup@@ eri@@ ority complex of the later towards Canada .
Thus , American diplom@@ ats are aston@@ ished that every Canadian elec@@ tor does not have Can@@ ad@@ o-@@ American relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by President Obama helped the Conserv@@ ative government to have its 2009 budget adopted !
The four new communications between the American emb@@ ass@@ y in Ot@@ ta@@ wa and Washington published yesterday , give more sp@@ ic@@ y details to get one &apos;s teeth into .
A cable dated 22 Set@@ ember 2008 , in the very middle of the federal election campaign , tells to what extent the United States form part of the st@@ akes being debated by political leaders .
To the great aston@@ ishment of the American amb@@ ass@@ ador in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , David Wil@@ k@@ ins .
Mr. Wil@@ k@@ ins offers some explanations of this situation .
&quot; An almost inherent Canadian inf@@ eri@@ ority complex is perhaps in@@ duc@@ ing Canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal st@@ akes , rather than blame this election on the United States ( as during the free exchange campaign of 1988 ) .
The United States therefore are , he concludes , &quot; the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al el@@ eph@@ ant of this election : om@@ ni@@ present , but potentially too threatening to be talked about . &quot;
The amb@@ ass@@ ador understands this &quot; de@@ af@@ ening silence &quot; all the less , since the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship .
&quot; Log@@ ically , &quot; he feels , &quot; the ability of a candidate , of a party and even more of a party leader to m@@ am@@ age this essential relationship must be a key factor , which the voters have in mind when voting . &quot;
The other expression of this important sen@@ timent is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terr@@ y Bre@@ ese , char@@ g@@ é d &apos;@@ aff@@ aires in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ot@@ ta@@ wa .
&quot; Your journey will help ensure the government &apos;s survival of the vote of confidence at the start of February on the federal budget , which will post Canada &apos;s first deficit for over ten years due to a rel@@ a@@ unch plan of 30 to 40 thousand million dollars , &quot; writes Mr. Bre@@ ese .
No@@ where can be found any mention that the government had to ad@@ jour@@ n parliament before Christmas to avoid being defe@@ ated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed rel@@ a@@ unch plan .
Another communication dated Jan@@ a@@ ury 2008 and signed by amb@@ ass@@ ador Wil@@ k@@ ins , war@@ ns Washington about the increasingly negative image of the United States conve@@ yed by drama series broad@@ casts by C@@ BC .
The amb@@ ass@@ ador is worried by broad@@ casts such as B@@ order , Little Mos@@ que on the Pra@@ iri@@ e , Intelli@@ ge@@ ce and H@@ 2@@ O , which contain un@@ sub@@ tle references to M@@ aher Ar@@ ar , to the &quot; No F@@ ly List &quot; or again to kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings for rigorous inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation by the CIA .
Another cable tells that during their first bilateral meeting , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton asked her French opposite number Bern@@ ard K@@ ou@@ chner , whether Europe was ready to receive certain Guant@@ an@@ amo prisoners .
M. K@@ ou@@ chner rep@@ lied &quot; yes , &quot; but on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis .
At the end of the meeting , he wrote , &quot; he handed a paper to the Secretary of State on the subject of Om@@ ar K@@ ha@@ d@@ r , a Mos@@ lem aged 15 of Canadian origin . &quot;
&quot; The Secretary agreed to review the case . &quot;
It should be noted in conclusion that temp@@ ers became heated about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
Tom F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an , an former advis@@ er very close to Stephen Har@@ per , declared on C@@ BC waves that the person responsible for this massive le@@ ak should be &quot; as@@ ass@@ inated . &quot;
He ech@@ o@@ ed Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee in the United States .
A worldwide plan for rene@@ wing lighting .
Yesterday at Can@@ cu@@ n UNO put forward a plan of renovation of domestic , commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to securing a reduction of greenhouse gases ( G@@ ES ) corresponding to almost one-@@ third of the additional reduction needed to stabili@@ se the planet &apos;s climate by 2020 .
This ambitious plan is one of a number of concrete projects , which UNO hopes to have adopted at Can@@ cu@@ n to offset the absence of mandatory reduction undertakings by industri@@ alised countries .
According to the plan tabled yesterday , if inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs , which still hold 50 to 70 % of the market , were replaced by flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs , or better still , by elec@@ trol@@ umin@@ es@@ cent di@@ ode bul@@ bs ( D@@ EL or LED in English ) , the bulk of the 1.@@ 8 thousand million tonnes of G@@ ES em@@ itted on the planet to provide ill@@ um@@ ination for human beings , would be avoided .
I@@ ll@@ um@@ ination is responsible for 8 % of worldwide emissions .
This is the equivalent of 70 % of the emissions by the world &apos;s motor vehicles .
Last year at Copenhagen the high emissions countries such as the United States , China , Europe and others including Canada , adopted voluntary plans of reduction to bring down global emissions of G@@ ES from 53 G@@ t to 49 G@@ t .
But it will be necessary to sub@@ trac@@ t from this figure a further 5 G@@ t to stabili@@ se the increase of climate warming by 2020 at 2 ° C in order to avoid loss of control .
In inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs 95 % of energy is dis@@ si@@ p@@ ated in the form of heat and only the remaining 5 % produce light .
With flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs , the dis@@ si@@ p@@ ation of energy is reduced by 75 % and with the new D@@ EL bul@@ bs , the energy requirement is addi@@ tionally reduced by double that amount .
Flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs last on an average between 6@@ 000 and 10 000 hours .
The new D@@ EL bul@@ bs such as those launched by Phili@@ ps this week , Phili@@ ps having mor@@ e@@ po@@ ver participated in a UNO study , have a life expect@@ ancy of 25 000 hours and consu@@ me 80 % less energy than inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs , giving an idea of the saving , which would be possible in a plan of replacement applicable to 100 countries .
These entirely novel bul@@ bs can also work with r@@ he@@ o@@ stat@@ s , em@@ itting very little heat .
And they contain no mer@@ cury .
Several specialists have voic@@ ed rever@@ v@@ ations concerning flu@@ o@@ compact bul@@ bs , because they contain mer@@ cury and because it is necessary to dis@@ pose of them as dangerous waste , which is not always possible in developing countries , unless the manufacturers issue instructions .
But , states the report , the principal source of mer@@ cury emission on the planet is not the flu@@ o@@ comp@@ ast bul@@ b , but rather carbon thermal emission centres , which em@@ it a lot of mer@@ cury to produce the electricity wast@@ ed in inc@@ and@@ es@@ cent bul@@ bs .
In the United States alone , these centres em@@ it 25 000 tonnes of mer@@ cury a year .
The report details the gains , which every country would achieve through this international programme .
For example , Indonesia would save a thousand million dollars a year on purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 , the equivalent of 3.5 thermal centres , whose construction would cost 2.5 thousand million dollars .
I@@ vor@@ y Coast is ner@@ v@@ ously expecting the announcement of the election results .
The UNO Secretary-General , B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon , has called for the publication &quot; without delay &quot; of the results of the I@@ vor@@ y Coast presidential election , on the exp@@ iry of the set period .
&quot; The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the pro@@ visi@@ onal results without further delay &quot; stressed a spo@@ kes@@ man for the head of UNO . &quot;
&quot; He asks all I@@ vor@@ y Coast parties and institutions to show responsibility and to ab@@ stain from any initiatives pending the ann@@ ou@@ cement of the pro@@ visi@@ onal results . &quot;
Despite pressures exer@@ ted by certain foreign governments , the electoral commission has allowed th target date of Wednesday mid@@ night to pass , without publishing the results three days after the Sunday voting .
About for@@ ty minutes before the exp@@ iry of the set period the president of the independent electoral commission &quot; continued to work &quot; on the announ@@ b@@ cement of the results .
Throughout the world , calls became more frequent on Wednesday for the electoral commission finally to declare the name of the winner of the second round , Laur@@ ent G@@ bag@@ bo or his oppon@@ en@@ ent Al@@ ass@@ ane O@@ u@@ att@@ ara .
But the G@@ bag@@ bo camp is counting ont he cancellation by the Constitutional Council of &quot; frau@@ dul@@ ent &quot; votes in the north , received by the ex-@@ re@@ bels of the New For@@ ces ( F@@ N ) since the failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in September 2002 .
Pas@@ cal Aff@@ i N &apos;@@ Bu@@ ess@@ an , campaign director of the I@@ vor@@ y Coast president , stated that the man@@ œ@@ eu@@ v@@ res of intim@@ id@@ ation of elec@@ tors by the F@@ N in the north of the country had dis@@ su@@ aded the parti@@ s@@ ans of the leaving president from voting .
Any election could be ann@@ ul@@ led , if complaints by G@@ ha@@ g@@ bo are accepted by the Constitutional Council .
G@@ bag@@ bo &apos;s enemies al@@ lege that the highest Court of the cou@@ try is not im@@ partial , since it is presi@@ ded by Paul Y@@ ao N &apos;@@ Dr@@ é , a close political ally of G@@ bag@@ bo .
Al@@ ass@@ ane O@@ u@@ att@@ ara , the man from the north , who den@@ ies any links with the ex-@@ re@@ bels , has described as &quot; unacceptable &quot; the delay in making the announcement of the results and has asked G@@ bag@@ bo to respect them , but has not gone so far as to claim victory .
His allies state that G@@ bag@@ bo is blocking the publication of the results , because he knows that he lost and that compl@@ aining to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from publishing the results , would be illegal .
The second round of voting in the presidential election on Sunday was thought to have crow@@ ned the process of re@@ unification and of reconciliation of a country split in two for years .
On Wednesday UNO warned the I@@ vor@@ y Coast political class that it might be held res@@ po@@ on@@ sible for any violence .
Laur@@ ent G@@ bag@@ bo finished at the top in the first round on 11 October , with 38 % of votes against 32 % for Al@@ ass@@ ane O@@ u@@ att@@ ara , who received the public support of the former pres@@ dient Hen@@ ri Kon@@ an Be@@ di@@ é ( 25 % in the fir@@ ts round ) .
The rate of unemployment in France has remained stable in the 3rd quarter .
The rate of unemployment in France according to the International Labour Office has remained stable at 9.@@ 3 % in metro@@ politan France ( 9.@@ 7 % taking into account overseas Dé@@ part@@ ements ) tr@@ n@@ sp@@ ires from data corrected for pro@@ visi@@ onal seasonal variations ( CV@@ S ) published on TH@@ urs@@ day by the In@@ see .
The number of unemployed is 2.@@ 6@@ 31 million in metro@@ politan France .
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.@@ 3 % of native working population and 9.@@ 7 of the DO@@ M .
Over one year , unemployment has risen by 0.@@ 1 points .
Seen more broadly , 3.@@ 4 million persons in metro@@ politan France are not working during the third quarter but wish to work , whether they are , or are not available for work within two weeks and whether or not they are looking for work .
T@@ e position of the young in the labour market has wor@@ sen@@ ed with a fresh rise in the unemployment rate to 24.@@ 2 % in metro@@ politan France ( + , 9.@@ 2 points over three months + 0.5 points over the year ) and 25 % including the DO@@ M .
In the third quarter , 6@@ 37 000 young people between 15 and 24 were unemployed ( B@@ IT ) .
Ol@@ der people experienced a slight rise of unemployment to 6.@@ 4 % in metro@@ politan France ( + 0.@@ 2 points over three months and over a year ) , equal to 4@@ 82 000 persons of 50 or over and 6.@@ 6 % for the DO@@ M .
Only the 25-@@ 39 benef@@ ited from stable unemployment in the third quarter being 8 . , 3 % in metro@@ politan France ( -@@ 0.@@ 1 points over three months and + 0.@@ 1 point@@ so@@ ver a year ) and 8.@@ 8 % in the whole of France .
Since 2006 , the In@@ see no longer publish@@ es the mon@@ n@@ h@@ ly unemployment rate , following arguments about its method of calculation .
On the other hand , Eurostat , the statistical agency of the Euro@@ ean Union , continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.@@ 8 % for France ( DO@@ M included ) in October after 9.@@ 9 % in September .
Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini is under arrest
Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini , 53 , director of waste processing companies and brother of the president of General Council of Bou@@ ch@@ es-@@ du@@ -@@ Rh@@ one , was arrested and sent to Lu@@ yn@@ es prison near Ai@@ x-@@ en-@@ Provence in the context of an investigation of public contracts presum@@ ed frau@@ dul@@ ent .
According to his att@@ or@@ ney , Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini is accused of the abu@@ sive use of company property , the th@@ eft public funds , of receiving st@@ olen goods , of active corruption and of the sale of influence .
&quot; Alex@@ ande Gu@@ er@@ ein@@ i is comb@@ ative and is willing to answer any questions which the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate may ask , but not fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es . &quot;
&quot; It is easy to acc@@ use him of a number of re@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible actions , but quite another to prove them &quot; declared his att@@ or@@ ney , Florence Rau@@ lt , to AP@@ F , before her client &apos;s hearing .
M. Gu@@ er@@ ini , brother of the strong man of the socialist party in the dé@@ partement , Jean-@@ No@@ el Gu@@ er@@ ini , passed to his judge prior to his hearing through his att@@ or@@ ney an explanatory memor@@ an@@ dum .
One of his intim@@ ates , Phili@@ ppe Rap@@ ez@@ zi was also det@@ ained on W@@ ed esday even@@ eing .
According to his att@@ or@@ ney , Me Lu@@ ci@@ en Simon , his client never did anything other than perform his duties .
Conc@@ erning the award of contracts or the destination of the related funds , he had no knowledge of them , said Me Simon .
In this matter , Daniel P@@ inn@@ a , formerly direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of servi@@ es of the Au@@ b@@ agne con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation was det@@ ained for ques@@ tioning on Wednesday concerning the th@@ eft of public funds and complic@@ ity and released on police b@@ ail , coupled with a prohi@@ bition on meeting any persons involved in the case .
&quot; My client has given explanations of the alleg@@ ations against him . &quot;
2 &quot; The examining ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate took this into account and did not depri@@ ve him of his freedom , &quot; said his att@@ or@@ ney , Me Y@@ ann Arn@@ ou@@ x .
Four other persons were det@@ ained for ques@@ tioning and released during the night of Tuesday to Wedn@@ m@@ esday , two of them on b@@ ail , said the assi@@ stant public prosec@@ utor , Michel R@@ aff@@ in .
Michel Kar@@ ab@@ ad@@ j@@ ak@@ ian , assi@@ stant direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of the clean@@ sing@@ of Mar@@ sei@@ lle Province Metro@@ pole ( MP@@ M ) is being prosec@@ uted for &quot; sale of influence and passive corruption . &quot;
Two func@@ tion@@ aries of the Au@@ b@@ agne con@@ ur@@ b@@ ation . Mich@@ è@@ le Du@@ val and Christop@@ he Br@@ ingu@@ ier , were arrested and qu@@ ation@@ ed one concerning the &quot; th@@ eft of public property by a person responsible for public service &quot; and the other concerning &quot; complic@@ ity in the th@@ eft of public funds . &quot;
Lastly , the comp@@ an@@ ion of Alexand@@ re Gu@@ er@@ ini , Je@@ anne Per@@ etti was ques@@ tioned concerning &quot; receiving st@@ olen company ro@@ per@@ ty . &quot;
Among persons confronted with M. Gu@@ er@@ ini is Steph@@ ane Brun@@ en@@ go@@ -@@ Gir@@ ard , rec@@ et@@ ly arrested in a parallel affair concerning frau@@ dul@@ ent public contracts involving Cor@@ si@@ ca .
Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ators suspect his companies of having served for large-scale money la@@ undering .
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several Court investigations of X in April 2009 following anonymous letters concerning presum@@ ed fraud relating to public contracts , in particular for waste disposal .
According to a source close to the inquiry , the investigations concentrate in particular on the conditions of the award and functioning of a discharge of La Ci@@ ot@@ at , which coll@@ ects Au@@ b@@ agne waste as well as the waste from certain towns of the urban community of Mar@@ sei@@ lle ( MP@@ M ) .
Aff@@ air of C@@ lo@@ thil@@ de Rei@@ ss : The Elys@@ ée has exagger@@ ated the involvement of Syria
During over ten months , from July 2009 to May 2010 , the fate of C@@ lo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss , the young French res@@ e@@ er@@ ch worker arrested in Iran for &quot; es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , &quot; ms@@ de France hold its bre@@ ath , al@@ er@@ ted diplomacy and under@@ lined the deterioration of rel@@ ati@@ ions between Paris and T@@ eher@@ an .
All under the careful scrutiny of United States diplom@@ ats .
American documents obtained by Wiki@@ Le@@ aks and consulted by Le Mon@@ de , reveal some of the background of this crisis .
They describe how the Elys@@ ée explained its strategy to the Americans , going so far as to give them advice on the treatment of their own &quot; ho@@ stage &quot; in Iran crises ( a small group of tri@@ pp@@ ers ) .
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Fren@@ ch@@ woman was not balanced by the release of Maj@@ id Kak@@ av@@ and , an Iranian under arrest in France and sought by American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme .
Lastly , they place in a g@@ lar@@ ing light the way in which the French presidency tried to manip@@ ulate the media to give cre@@ dence of the idea that the Syri@@ an president , B@@ ach@@ ar Al-@@ Ass@@ ad played a central part in the release of C@@ lo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss .
In reality , he had not done anything .
A diplomatic cable sent on 12 August 2009 to Paris is entitled &quot; Iran : French comments on how to manage cases of host@@ ages . &quot;
The Elys@@ ée advis@@ er on strategic matters , Franç@@ ois Ri@@ chi@@ er , accompanied by the director of Qu@@ ai d &apos;@@ Or@@ say for North Africa and the Middle East , Patri@@ ce Pa@@ oli , had a discussion with the American diplom@@ at , Kath@@ le@@ en Al@@ egr@@ one .
They explained to her the French method .
They advised the Americans to arrange to re@@ patri@@ ate their own nationals det@@ ained in Iran .
&quot; Make a lot of noise , &quot; they said , &quot; h@@ ammer ceas@@ eless@@ ly the words &quot; fundamental rights of man , &quot; &quot; inno@@ c@@ ence &quot; and &quot; immediate release &quot; in the media . &quot;
&quot; You must not embar@@ r@@ ass the Iranian regime , which is sensitive to its image . &quot;
&quot; Do it all the more when the Iran@@ i@@ ans ask you not to . &quot;
Because after attempts to discuss the matter through discre@@ et channels have failed , silence will not solve anything , the Iran@@ i@@ ans being past@@ -@@ masters of del@@ aying tac@@ tics . &quot;
M. Ri@@ chi@@ er adds that arres@@ ting foreigners is a familiar Iranian tac@@ tic , taking host@@ ages for political black@@ mail .
He announced that ther@@ el@@ ease of C@@ lo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss from prison ( which will take place on 16 August , the day on which she took refuge in the French emb@@ ass@@ y ) would involve paying the Iran@@ i@@ ans a large sum of money ( 230 000 E@@ ur as a caution ) .
And he advised that the Elys@@ ée expected other ho@@ stage crises , a phenomenon which would get worse .
He said that the Iran@@ i@@ ans might arrest in the near future another of some 18@@ 00 French citizens who live in Iran .
28@@ .@@ 8.@@ 09
C@@ lo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss has been out of prison for twelve days , but is unable to leave Iran .
A piece of information was broadcast : the Iranian Maj@@ id Kak@@ av@@ and , whose ex@@ tradition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic material to Iran the United States are demanding , was fre@@ ed in Paris by a Court .
According to numerous observers , the American emb@@ ass@@ y is considering this worrying coinci@@ dence .
For Washington which tracks Iranian illegal nuclear material acquisition networks , the release of Maj@@ id K@@ ha@@ k@@ av@@ g@@ and is bad news .
Has France accepted a deal ?
The release of the Iranian against that of the Fren@@ ch@@ woman ?
During the conversation with Kath@@ le@@ en Al@@ leg@@ r@@ one on 4 September , Franç@@ ois Ri@@ chi@@ er gave an assurance that this was not the case .
He said that he Elys@@ ée was not only completely surprised by the Ju@@ dge &apos;s ruling , but also tried to oppose it .
He said that there were lively exchanges bet@@ wen the French presidency and and the Gar@@ de des Sc@@ e@@ aux at the time , Mich@@ è@@ le Alli@@ ot-@@ Mari@@ e. but the French government could not change the Court ruling .
M. Ri@@ chi@@ er also wants to demonstrate that Maj@@ id Kak@@ av@@ and continues under close surv@@ ei@@ l@@ ance by the French secret service .
The Elys@@ ée advis@@ er di@@ als a number , hang@@ s up and then inform@@ s the American diplom@@ at that the Iranian is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian emb@@ ass@@ y .
During C@@ lo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss &apos; detention in Iran , the Elys@@ ée did not control its efforts by means of comm@@ uni@@ ques and media &quot; le@@ aks &quot; to create the impression that the Syri@@ an p@@ esi@@ dent B@@ ach@@ ar Al-@@ Ass@@ ad was playing the important and influential part of an intermedi@@ ary .
The Americans observe this activity without ir@@ ony and find that manipulation bears fruit because several Press articles repeat the official French version .
A tel@@ eg@@ ram dated 25 August 2009 men@@ tions the media &quot; bli@@ tz &quot; by French officials .
On what is based so much &quot; gratitude &quot; ep@@ res@@ sed to M. Ass@@ ad , asks the Paris emb@@ ass@@ y .
Not@@ with@@ standing their declarations full of praise , French officials priv@@ ately admit that they only have the v@@ agu@@ est notion of what the Syri@@ ans really did .
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elys@@ ée put out this fiction .
It states that the intensive effort of communication tries to vali@@ date Sarkozy &apos;s policy of moving closer to Syria .
A policy launched in 2008 , which was seen by many critics in France and abroad as being pre@@ mature and without merit .
By exagger@@ ating the part played by Syria , Paris is trying to show Syria how much praise it could gain by playing a constructive part in the region .
The objective is also that of so@@ wing seeds of dis@@ cor@@ d bet@@ wen Syria and Iran .
The American emb@@ ass@@ y knows this from a reliable source .
On 11 August , Franç@@ ois Ri@@ chi@@ er confi@@ ded him that the French did not of course know whether the Syri@@ ans had done anything .. &quot; bien s@@ û@@ r , nous ne sav@@ ons pas si les Syri@@ ens ont fa@@ it qu@@ oi que ce so@@ it . &quot;
But that they still than@@ ked them .
This might at least conf@@ use the Iran@@ i@@ ans .
C@@ lo@@ til@@ de Rei@@ ss returns to France on 16 May 2010
N@@ I@@ col@@ as Sarkozy receives her at the Elys@@ ée .
In a comm@@ unique , he thanks the pres@@ idents f@@ o Brazil , Sen@@ egal and Syria for their &quot; active role in favour of the release of our comp@@ atri@@ ot . &quot;
No on-line games for young Kor@@ e@@ ans after mid@@ night .
According to government authorities , the South Korean govern@@ em@@ t will pass a law called &quot; C@@ inder@@ ella , &quot; which will prohi@@ bit ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents from playing on-line games after mid@@ night by means of bo@@ cking their access .
According to represent@@ a@@ it@@ ves of the Minist@@ ries of Culture and Family , a draft law will be submitted to parliament in December to ask on-line game companies to block access of ju@@ ven@@ ies under 16 to their games after mid@@ night .
A lot of children play these games all night and then experience difficulties in studying at school and in living a normal life in day@@ time .
&quot; We think that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep , &quot; declared to AF@@ P J@@ o R@@ in , the Minister in charge of pil@@ oting the draft law .
On@@ -@@ line games will now be accessible at 6 a.m.
The Minister stated that the companies would have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law .
He added that the government would also ask the companies to limit the daily time of access to these games by young people whose parents have asked for this to be done .
He would also make available to people requesting it , free-@@ of-@@ charge software making it possible to limit time spent on Internet .
South Korea is one of the most &quot; connected &quot; countries and the newspapers regularly report various facts linked to an intensive use of the Internet .
The country is also the un@@ disp@@ uted champion of worldwide online game competitions .
In November , South Korea won four gold med@@ als at World Cy@@ ber Games in a contest of 58 other nations .
World champ@@ ion@@ ships 20@@ 18-@@ 20@@ 22 : Fi@@ fa ap@@ points organising countries .
Tor@@ ment due to susp@@ ected corruption . On Thursday , the executive committee of Fi@@ fa will appoint countries to organise World Cup matches in 20@@ 18 and 20@@ 22 , an emin@@ ently polit@@ cal choice , where influence and lob@@ b@@ ying batt@@ les are liable to take preced@@ ence of technical criteria .
One thing is certain ; the 20@@ 18 edition of the Fi@@ fa competition will take place in Europe , the traditional bas@@ tion of the game ( 4 candidates , Great Britain , Russia , Sp@@ ain@@ -@@ Portugal and Belgi@@ um-@@ The Netherlands ; An@@ gl@@ eter@@ re , Rus@@ sie , Esp@@ ag@@ ne-@@ Portugal , Pay@@ s@@ -B@@ as-@@ Belgi@@ que ) .
That of 20@@ 22 will be a lot more exotic , Fi@@ fa hoping to con@@ quer new territories ( Qu@@ atar , Australia ) after a first contest on the African continent in 2010 or to pursue its introduction into the USA , or the Far East ( Japan , South Korea ) .
The list of person@@ alities of the delegations ( David Cam@@ eron , Price William , J@@ ose Lu@@ is Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez Zap@@ ater@@ o , J@@ ose S@@ oc@@ rates , Bill Clinton , the E@@ mir of Q@@ atar , the heads of the Belgian and Dutch governments , Zi@@ dan@@ e , B@@ eck@@ ham , Cru@@ y@@ ff ) give an idea of the economic and political st@@ akes of a world competition .
Beh@@ in@@ d-@@ the-@@ scenes bar@@ gaining may therefore last up to the last minute .
For the rest , it is difficult to establish a hierarch@@ y among the candidates .
According to a Fi@@ fa assessment report , the British , Span@@ ish@@ -@@ Portuguese ( 20@@ 18 ) and American ( 20@@ 22 ) cases advance better arguments than their competitors .
But these considerations will not wei@@ gh very heavily with the 22 members of the executive committee , when it comes to voting .
The Sunday Times whi@@ ose disclos@@ ures resulted in the suspension of two members of the executive committee ( Re@@ yn@@ ald Tem@@ eri@@ i and A@@ mos Adam@@ u ) , might thus have ru@@ ined the chances of its country , the cra@@ dle of football , which only hosted the World Cup once , in 1966 .
On Monday the BBC broadcast a documentary concerning three influential members of the executive committee , Ric@@ ardo Tei@@ zei@@ ra , Nicolas Le@@ o@@ z and I@@ ssa Hay@@ at@@ ou .
Up@@ setting Fi@@ fa and embar@@ ras@@ ing the British representatives , who engaged in intensive lob@@ b@@ ying in recent weeks , mainly through David B@@ eck@@ ham .
The head of the British government hopes to repeat the coup of his pre@@ d@@ ess@@ es@@ or Tony Blair , who in 2005 secured the choice of London as the venue of the 2012 Olympic Games .
Will this intensive activity suff@@ ice to regu@@ ild the shi@@ eld of England in the eyes of the executive committee ?
Nothing is less certain , because the Sp@@ ain@@ -@@ Portugal du@@ o does not lack for advantages , with its sta@@ dia already completed , its expertise ( World Cup 82 in Spain , 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona , Euro 2004 in Portugal ) and its football culture .
But the som@@ bre economic and financial prospects of the two countries could pour cold water on their ambitions .
Pos@@ sible re@@ pris@@ als against the British and doubts about the solven@@ cy of Spain and Portugal can only improve the standing of Russia , which has become a powerful out@@ si@@ der , despite its lacks ( sta@@ dia , hotels , transport ) .
But the Prime Minister V@@ ladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and den@@ ounced &quot; unfair competition in the preparation of voting &quot; in a vei@@ led reference to accus@@ ations in the British Press against members of the executive committee .
&quot; They are being sp@@ attered with mu@@ d and attempts are being made to compromise them , &quot; alleged Mr. Putin .
Conc@@ erning 20@@ 22 , the United States with exper@@ ein@@ ce of 1994 , appear the obvious favour@@ ites .
The leading world ec@@ om@@ om@@ ic power , the seat of the principal spons@@ ors of Fi@@ fa , the country appears to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea who have separately built a very fine project .
But these new candi@@ dat@@ ures appear pre@@ mature for two countries , which jointly organised the 2002 trial .
Another threat : The award of the 20@@ 26 World Competition to China , ard@@ ently desired by Fi@@ fa , which will in fact ext@@ ingu@@ ish Asian chances for 20@@ 22 .
Conc@@ erning Q@@ atar which has made great play of proposing futur@@ istic sta@@ dia and Australia , Fi@@ fa would pursue its expansion into new regions , but these two countries offer more risk than certainty .
Like Japan and South Korea , Australia could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights of European countries , the ner@@ ve centre of the war for Fi@@ fa .
Second mandate : the evidence
De Gaulle really hes@@ it@@ ated .
Mit@@ ter@@ and made others believe that he hes@@ it@@ ated .
Val@@ ery G@@ is@@ card d &apos;@@ E@@ sta@@ ing and Jacques Chirac had not the sligh@@ test hes@@ itation .
And Nicolas Sak@@ o@@ zy still fewer than they .
An Elys@@ ée mandate tells a different story .
Accordingly , the current head of State will be a candidate in 2012 .
But the evidence conflicts with the my@@ sti@@ que of the presidential function .
It is now necessary to pre@@ tend that the doubt had always existed .
In one sense as in the other .
In 2006 , even without believ@@ ing it , friends of Jacques Chirac pret@@ ended that a third mandate was not excluded .
On 15 November with a grave air , Nicolas Sarkozy gave an assurance that he would make his decision &quot; some@@ time in the autumn of 2011 &quot;
The fact that on Tuesday night at the Elys@@ ée before UM@@ P dep@@ u@@ ties he called up the prospect of &quot; two mand@@ ates &quot; sow@@ ed some fe@@ ver@@ ish refl@@ ections .
Was this the official ann@@ ou@@ cement of his candi@@ dat@@ ure ?
Far from it .
The president only rec@@ alled that the 2008 revised con@@ sti@@ ution limited the number of five-@@ year terms to only two .
He stated facts , but he did not make an announcement .
This is not for the first time that he hum@@ or@@ ously men@@ tions the presidential election at such meetings .
He said in July 2009 that at best they only had another seven and a half years of him .
Reb@@ el@@ ote in May 2010 : Do not believe that I only thought about it afterwards
His intentions of the day before yesterday did not make him any more or any less a candidate than those of the day before that .
If they occasion comments , the reason is tw@@ o@@ fold .
On the one hand , the acceler@@ ation of the progress of the candi@@ dat@@ ure of the socialist party .
But it is not the entry into the lists of Seg@@ ol@@ ene Royal , which pus@@ hes Nicolas Sarkozy to un@@ mask himself .
The reason is , on the contrary , that his 2012 candi@@ dat@@ ure is clearly what many members of the socialist party are calling for , an earlier plan of battle than one originally planned .
The bad poll@@ s , on the other hand .
For the first time , voters on the right preferred the candi@@ dat@@ ure of Franç@@ ois F@@ ill@@ on to that of Nicolas Sarkozy ( 45 % against 44 % , according to EV@@ A-@@ L &apos;@@ Express ) .
The ent@@ our@@ age of the Prime Minister immediately said that it had a candidate and that there was no debate about this within UM@@ P .
Jean-@@ Pierre R@@ aff@@ arin said that if he , the candidate , believed that defeat was a possibility , he would not be a candidate .
Ala@@ in Ju@@ pp@@ é said in the face of evidence and by way of correction that the candidate would always believe that he could win .
Euro : B@@ CE comp@@ elled to buy State securities
The last annual meeting of the board of govern@@ ors of the European Central Bank ( B@@ CE ) had to be the occasion of speci@@ fying the methods of emerging from the crisis , or at least of announc@@ ing the end of a good number of un@@ conventional monetary policy operations , which have to be completed by the year end .
The European sovereign debt crisis obli@@ ges the issuing institute in Frankfurt to ba@@ have less per@@ emp@@ t@@ ori@@ ly , on pain of ag@@ grav@@ ating the situation , which is now more than ten@@ se enough already on European markets of obligation .
The political cost would be all the higher .
Yesterday at a Press conference , the French Minister of Finance , Christ@@ ine Lag@@ ar@@ de gre@@ eted the active role played by the B@@ CE to resolve the debt crisis of European States .
She did not wish to say whether she thought that the Central Bank had to do more , for example , by increasing its programme of buying sovereign bonds .
She said that she would communicate her thoughts to her European partners .
In Brussels on the day before during his hearing before the economic and monetary affairs commission of the European parliament , the chairman of the B@@ CE , Jean-@@ Claude T@@ rich@@ et did not prove more diff@@ use about his intentions , cont@@ enting himself with saying that the programme of buying State securities in the secondary market would continue and that they would see what will be decided at the meeting on Thursday .
The only certainty : The B@@ CE would keep its principal rate of interest un@@ changed at 1 % , histor@@ ically the lowest since May 2009 .
F@@ actually , the obligatory Treas@@ ury purchases by the B@@ CE doub@@ led during last week to almost 1.@@ 35 thousand million Euros .
And , according to in@@ discre@@ tions of market operators , it made fresh purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday .
In total , Euro@@ system central banks bought 67 thousand millions &apos; worth of Euros since May 2010 .
There is no doubt among market operators about the expectations of a pursuit of purchases ( see page 29 ) .
Econom@@ ists no longer expect any marked change of cap .
Whilst loan operations at over three months have already disappeared from the B@@ CE Bank ar@@ senal , the latter continues to grant unlimited cash loans on generous terms and for periods from one we@@ ke to three months .
Econom@@ ists now expect that the facility will be extended by some months .
Michael Schu@@ bert , an econom@@ ist at Commer@@ z@@ bank cannot imagine that it will modify it pro@@ gr@@ ame to any great extent .
He says that this would cause new short-term tensions .
Nor@@ best B@@ rä@@ ms , an econom@@ ist at S@@ al says that a gradual exit to be announced during the fir@@ ts quarter of 2011 appears more likely .
O@@ ppen@@ heim .
Nor@@ bet B@@ rä@@ ms adds that on the level of its interventions in the public debt market , the B@@ CE would have to make purchases of these bonds adequately large to revi@@ ve the lack@@ lu@@ str@@ e market .
Taking into account the large exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets of the Euro zone , the issuing institute has no option other than to maintain a presence in the market .
An important bonds manager said yesterday that the Bank must at all costs off@@ sat the shortage of investors in the market and prevent a boom of payments by the most vulnerable States .
Because if interest rates take off , States will be all the more anx@@ ious to reduce their in@@ deb@@ t@@ edness , or to stabili@@ se it .
This is the price of safeguarding the Euro .
In Italy , the Berlusconi government is turning its back .
After the start of a dis@@ qui@@ eting week for Italy , the situation yesterday was somewhat easier with the ref@@ lu@@ x of 10-@@ year obligatory rates .
Retur@@ n to prec@@ arious calm .
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy , the regional pres@@ idents said that Gi@@ uli@@ o Tre@@ mon@@ ti described the situation as &quot; in@@ sol@@ ub@@ le &quot; and that he was waiting for an unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able weekend , which he subsequently denied .
In any event on Tuesday the difference between German long-term rates reached a record of 2@@ 10 base points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bank@@ rupt@@ cy ( CD@@ S ) took off to reach 26@@ 3 points , producing a certain amount of pan@@ ic in Rome .
At a session of the council of ministers , Sil@@ vio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the differ@@ ential from German rates was over 400 base points .
But his right arm , Gi@@ anni L@@ etta , declared himself very worried by market tur@@ bul@@ ence and by a possible cont@@ ag@@ ion from Ireland .
The good news is that Italy , the third largest economy of the Eurozone , is not like Greece and Ireland .
According to Ir@@ win Ste@@ zer , an ec@@ on@@ o@@ ist at the Hu@@ dson Institute , the bad news is that it is like Portugal .
Clearly , its problem is an absence of growth and inadequate tax revenues , placing the State in in danger of no longer being able to cover its financial requirements .
The most recent forecasts from Brussels acted like a cold shower on the government .
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1 % in 2011 and 1.4 % in 2012 , wh@@ ist the budget now under scrutiny by the Sen@@ ate records 1.3 and 2.0 % respectively .
Under these conditions , the European Commission calcul@@ ates that the public deficit will be 4.@@ 3 % of the GDP next year ( ver@@ sus 3.@@ 9 % forecast by the government ) and 3.5 % in 2012 ( instead of the forecast of 2.@@ 7 % ) .
This is the reason for the rum@@ our of a new collective budget of 7 thousand million Euros , which might be drawn up after the holidays .
The economic affairs commission@@ er Ol@@ li Reh@@ n said that if necessary , new austerity measures will have to be taken .
For the moment , Italy receives support from international institutions .
Arri@@ go Sad@@ un , the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF ass@@ ures that the foundations of Italian economy are sound .
Pi@@ er Carlo Pad@@ o@@ an , chief econom@@ ist of O@@ C@@ DE , states that there is no problem in the immediate future , in the short or in the long term , because despite its large debt ( 1@@ 19.@@ 2 % of G@@ IP in 2011 , N@@ DL@@ R ) . stabili@@ sation efforts demanded from Italy are smaller than those demanded from other countries .
There remains the question of political instability .
On 14 December , Sil@@ vio Berlusconi will face a motion of c@@ ensure in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , following which an early general election could take place at the end of March .
A period not suited to the taking of decisions in the event of a serious crisis would then begin .
Europeans are thinking about means of strengthening anti-@@ crisis devices .
Christ@@ ine Lag@@ ar@@ de h@@ amm@@ ered the following home yesterday at a Press conference in Paris : She said that she believed Europeans showed on Sunday both day and night that they are committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone .
Although that it was only relative , the det@@ ente recorded here yesterday of interest rates on European State bonds brought water to the m@@ ills of governments and of the B@@ CE .
But one cannot yet speak about a start of norm@@ alisation .
The Standard &amp; Po@@ or agency announced that it might de@@ value the Portuguese debt , the target of most of today &apos;s speculation .
The economists of Ex@@ ane B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ bas feel that as in May , there is a real lack of clarity and political transparency en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ing banking systems in particular .
All the more because political time moves much more slowly than market time .
A@@ ware of this gap and of the dangers which it conc@@ eals , European countries are intensi@@ fying their discussions aimed at strengthening their existing anti-@@ crisis devices .
Inform@@ al consultations between Ministers of Finance of countries most directly concerned and more widely their G20 opposite numbers , are well advanced .
And also in the exp@@ ec@@ tation of meetings of the Euro@@ group and the Eco@@ fin at the start of next week .
The B@@ CE is meeting today .
On the agenda is the fate of un@@ conventional measures of support for countries of the Eurozone in the market col@@ li@@ mat@@ or ( see above ) .
Conc@@ erning the European financial stability fund ( F@@ ES@@ F ) its executive director Klaus Reg@@ ling began a tour of Asia starting from Singapore , to inform Far East investors about the progress of the crisis i Europe .
Whilst the object of these visits is not to raise funds , it is certainly intended to prepare the ground for doing so .
The first issues of F@@ ES@@ F bonds are expected to take place next month .
Yesterday , an official American representative told Re@@ uter that the United States would support a possible increase of funds for direct supplementary involvement of the IMF .
Front line cou@@ tries such as Spain and Portugal are preparing to adopt structural reforms , particularly concerning organisation of the labour market .
Re@@ forms which are additional to measures of austerity with a more rapid effect .
Lisbon and Madrid wish to embar@@ k on a path different from that taken by Greece and Ireland .
Both are anx@@ ious to avoid in any circumstances asking for international help , before introducing its own budgetary correc@@ tives and deciding on structural reforms essential for restoring long-term confidence .
Lastly , back@@ ers of European funds are discussing available options to speed up the process of norm@@ alisation of sovereign debt markets .
In Paris on 24 November , A@@ xel Weber first put forward the idea that if the 750 thousand million Euros released by Europe and the IMF were not adequate , the Un@@ ni@@ on would not hesitate to resort to the portfolio .
Econom@@ ists at Bar@@ cla@@ y Capital , a top Eur@@ e@@ op@@ ean sovereign debt market player , feel that an increase of about 100 thousand million Euros , prefer@@ ably in the form of a direct cash injection , would suff@@ ice .
The vehicle exists : The vehicle exists in the form of the European financial stabili@@ sation mechanism , currently containing 60 thousand million Euros .
A piece of advice likely to be examined carefully in European capit@@ als .
Most importantly , if market conditions prevail .
S@@ now and ice : 24 dé@@ part@@ ements have received an orange warning .
Epis@@ odes of snow are still causing traffic problems , especially in the secondary network in Britt@@ any and may dis@@ rupt certain economic activities .
Tw@@ enty-@@ four dé@@ part@@ ements are on orange alert due to a risk of snow and ice .

According to Met@@ eo France , continuous fl@@ ur@@ ries of snow are affecting the north of the Gir@@ on@@ de and both Char@@ entes and it is snow@@ ing ligh@@ tly over the I@@ le de France .
De@@ posi@@ ts of snow from 2 to 5 cm , 7 to 10 cm in places , are expected in the dé@@ part@@ ements in question and 1 to 3 cm , indeed up to 5 cm in the Paris region .

According to Met@@ eo France , snow epis@@ odes are sufficiently marked to create traffic problems and to dis@@ rupt certain economic activities .
In Cot@@ es d &apos;@@ Arm@@ or , access to vehicles of over 7 / 5 tonnes to several major roads is bar@@ red , including the Gu@@ ing@@ amp@@ -@@ Lan@@ ni@@ on and the Saint-@@ Bri@@ eu@@ c-@@ Lou@@ de@@ ac roads .
Traff@@ ic on the Britt@@ any secondary network is very difficult and the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie recommends that vehicles should only be used where absolutely necessary . Traff@@ ic of certain T@@ ER vehic@@ es has been suspended for the day .
In Pic@@ ar@@ dy , all school transport on Thursday has been prohibited .
No special measures are contem@@ pl@@ ated for Wednesday evening to restrict the traffic of heavy loads .
The pre@@ f@@ ecture asks all drivers to exercise the greatest possible care on roads and to adapt their driving accordingly .
The direc@@ tor@@ ate-@@ general of civil aviation ( D@@ G@@ AC ) has asked all air transport companies to cancel on Thursday 25 % of their flights to Ro@@ iss@@ y airport and 10 % to Or@@ ly airport , due to expected snow@@ fall .
The D@@ G@@ AC recommends air passengers to contact their carrier .

Metro Grand Paris : First financial proposals ;
Since the time when the debate about the modernisation of transport in the I@@ le-@@ de-@@ France reached its highest point , thousands of millions of Euros have been ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ging .
In the discussion of means .
Men@@ tion is made in particular of the 23 thousand million Euros for the Grand Paris metro which the Grand Paris company is to build .
To start this S@@ GP , the State announced a contribution of 4 thous@@ ans million Euros .
In the theoretical scheme , it is this sum which will then enable the S@@ GP to bor@@ row in the market a part of the financing of its double lo@@ op .
To@@ day@@ . the first calculations have begun .
The 2010 law concerning recti@@ fication financing examined by the parliamentary finance commission this morning , contains the devices needed for finding the initial sum .
There are two of them : the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase of the tax on offices in the I@@ le-@@ de-@@ France .
The first , says article 15 of the draft law is &quot; for the establishment of the Grand Paris company . &quot;
El@@ le est chi@@ ff@@ r@@ ée : It says : The yield of this tax is 1@@ 17 million Euros annually .
The second is a rec@@ asting of a tax on offic@@ es@@ m which exists already &quot; in order to modernis@@ e , to increase its yield and to al@@ locate this increase to the Grand Paris company . &quot;
How much will this will bring in ?
M@@ yst@@ ery .
This does not figure in the text .
It falls far short of the 4 thousand million .
The ex@@ pose states that tax resources are additional to the 4 thousand million Euros of capital to be invested by the State and passed to the Grand Paris company as the project progres@@ ses .
S@@ GP does not find this system sho@@ cking .
It is explained that from the moment the two sources of cash were created ( the two taxes , n@@ d@@ l@@ r ) it would be possible to cover the cost of three years of study and then resort to the 4 thousand million Euros .
&quot; This would be included in the budget and drawn on as the project develops &quot;
The S@@ GP estimates that the 4 thousand million Euros would be included in 2013 in the 2014 budget .
This device , in which the promised 4 thousand million Euros are already included , may give rise to a somewhat exc@@ ited parliamentary debate .
First public session on 7 December .
Ven@@ ge@@ ful h@@ ack@@ ers and sp@@ ies are waiting .
The Wiki@@ Le@@ aks affair has a double significance .
On the one hand , it is a scandal , which only looked sc@@ andal@@ ous in the light of the hypo@@ cris@@ y which prev@@ ails in relations between States , citizens and the Press .
On the other hand , it announ@@ ces profound changes on international level and points to a future dominated by reg@@ ression .
But let us take things in the right order .
The first aspect of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks is a confirmation of the fact that every secret service case ( of any country ) consists solely of Press c@@ utt@@ ings .
The &quot; extraordinary &quot; American re@@ vel@@ ations about the sexual hab@@ its of Berlusconi only report what it was possible to read for months in any daily ( except in those belonging to Berlusconi ) and the sin@@ ister car@@ ic@@ ature profile of K@@ ha@@ d@@ af@@ i has long been a cab@@ ar@@ et artists &apos;@@ sk@@ etch material .
The rule according to which secret files may only contain already known news is essential for secret services dynamic and not only in the present century .
If you visit a library devoted to American publications , you will see that every work repe@@ ats ( concerning the Gra@@ il , the myst@@ ery of Renn@@ es-@@ le-@@ Chat@@ eau , the Tem@@ pl@@ ars , or the Ro@@ si@@ cru@@ cians ) exactly that which was already set out in earlier works .
And this is so not only because the author of oc@@ cul@@ t texts does not like to do previously un@@ published research ( and does not know where to look for news about what does not exist ) , but because those who devote them@@ ss@@ l@@ ves to oc@@ cul@@ tism , do not believe what they already know and which confirms what they had already learned .
This is D@@ an Brown &apos;s success mechanism .
The same applies to secret files .
The inform@@ ant is la@@ zy and la@@ zy ( or limited ) is also the head of secret service ( otherwise he could be , for all I know , an editor at Liber@@ ation ) , who does not consider to be true what he recognises .
Top secret information about Berlusconi , which the Amer@@ ei@@ can emb@@ ass@@ y in Rome sent to the State Department , was the same as that which News@@ week had published the week before .
So why did the re@@ vel@@ ations about these files make so much noise ?
On the one hand , they say that every cultiv@@ ated person already knows that emb@@ assi@@ es have , at least since the end of the Second World War and since heads of State could telephone one another or fly to meet for dinner , lost their diplomatic function and except for some little representation exercises , have become centres of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
Every spec@@ t@@ ator of investigation films knows this very well and it is hypo@@ critical to pre@@ tend that he does not .
Nevertheless , repe@@ ating it in public bre@@ aches the duty to be hypo@@ critical and only places American diplomacy in a bad light .
Secondly , the idea of a h@@ ack@@ er being able to acquire the deep@@ est sec@@ rets of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the pres@@ tige of the State Department .
The scandal affects both the victims and the &quot; exec@@ u@@ tion@@ ers &quot; equally .
But let us look at the prof@@ oud nature of what has happened .
For@@ mer@@ ly , in the days of Or@@ well , one could see all power as Big Bro@@ ther , who controlled every action of his subjects .
The Or@@ wel@@ lian proph@@ ec@@ y proved completely true , since being able to be completely controlled thanks to the telephone , the hotel visited , the motorway taken and so on , the citizen became a total victim of the eye of power .
But when one demonstrates what happens now , that even the sec@@ rets of power c@@ ann@@ at escape the control of a h@@ ack@@ er , the control report ce@@ ases to be uni@@ direc@@ tional and is able to circul@@ ate .
Power controls every citizen , but every citizen , or at least the h@@ ack@@ er as the citizen &apos;s av@@ enger , can learn all the sec@@ rets of power .
How can a power last , if it can no longer keep its sec@@ rets ?
It is true , as George S@@ imm@@ el has already said that a real secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered ; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is a secret de@@ void of sec@@ rec@@ y , because it is in the public domain , but to disc@@ lose , as Wiki@@ Le@@ aks has done , that the sec@@ rets of H@@ ill@@ ary Cli@@ ton were empty sec@@ rets , means taking away all her power .
Wiki@@ Le@@ aks did not inj@@ ure Sarkozy or Merkel , but did considerably inj@@ ure Clinton and Obama .
What will be the consequences of this injury inf@@ lic@@ ted on a very powerful entity ?
Clearly , in future , States will no longer be able to place on line secret information , which would be like posting it on a street corner .
But it is also clear that with current technologies it is us@@ eless to hope to be able to discuss confidential reports on the telephone .
Nothing is easier than to discover if and when a head of State has f@@ lown away and to contact one of his / her colleagues .
How can private and confidential reports be discussed in the future ?
I know very well that for the moment my forecast is science fiction and f@@ anci@@ ful , but I have to imagine government agents who travel discre@@ et@@ ly by routes which cannot be checked and that they have learned messages by heart , or have conc@@ e@@ aled written information in the he@@ el of a shoe .
The information will be on a single copy kept in a locked d@@ tra@@ wer ; basically , the attempted Wat@@ erg@@ ate es@@ pi@@ on@@ age was less succ@@ es@@ ul than Wiki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s. au f@@ ond , la t@@ entative d &apos;@@ es@@ pi@@ onn@@ age du Wat@@ erg@@ ate a eu mo@@ ins de succ@@ ès que Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
I had occasion to write that technology goes forward like a cr@@ ab , namely , back@@ wards .
A century after the inv@@ ention of wireless tel@@ eg@@ ra@@ phy revolution@@ ised communications , Internet re-@@ established wire tel@@ eg@@ ra@@ phy ( telephone ) .
Video c@@ ass@@ ettes ( an@@ alogue ) had enabled cinema research workers to explore a film step@@ -@@ by-@@ step going back@@ ward and forward and discovering all the sec@@ rets of mon@@ tage , whilst digital CD &apos;s only allow j@@ umping from chapter to chapter , nam@@ s@@ ly by macro@@ por@@ tions .
With high-speed trains one can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours , whilst going by air a total of three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours are needed .
Is it therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques rever@@ t to hor@@ se-@@ drawn carri@@ ages .
A last observation .
In other days the Press tried to understand what was happening in secret in emb@@ assi@@ es .
Now it is emb@@ assi@@ es which ask the Press for confi@@ d@@ ne@@ ti@@ al information .
Climate : How France t@@ amp@@ ers with its promises of finance .
A year after the Copenhagen agreement it is time to look at the observ@@ ance of the promises of fast finance ( so-called fast start finance ) by developed countries .
And large-scale tam@@ per@@ ing cam to light .
According to the Copenhagen agre@@ em@@ s@@ nt , developed countries under@@ ook to furnis@@ h 30 thousand million dollars between 2010 and 2012 .
The European Union promised 7.@@ 2 thousand million Euros over three years and France 1.@@ 25 thousand million Euros ( 4@@ 20 million a year ) .
When CO@@ P@@ 16 opened , the European Union tried to persuade its partners of the authentic@@ ity of its commitment to rapid start finance , submitting a report detail@@ ing the actions of its m@@ ember@@ -@@ States , Press c@@ n@@ fer@@ ences , major side events , the distribution of broch@@ ures ... rap@@ port dé@@ ta@@ ill@@ ant l &apos;@@ action de ses Et@@ ats mem@@ bres , conf@@ ér@@ ence de pres@@ se , grand side event , distribution de broch@@ ures ...
The operation transparency is appreci@@ able and appreciated at its just value : developing countries and the civil society are doing the same and at the same level of prec@@ isi@@ on@@ . les pays en dé@@ velop@@ p@@ ement et la soci@@ été civi@@ le aim@@ er@@ ai@@ ent que t@@ ous les pays dé@@ velop@@ p@@ és fass@@ ent de m@@ ê@@ me avec un m@@ ê@@ me niveau de pré@@ c@@ ision .
The European Union announ@@ ces having allocated in 2010 2.2 thousand million Euros , a good to@@ ken of observ@@ ance of its promise of 7.@@ 2 thousand million Euros in 2012 .
But looking at details , things are more complicated .
This money must , according to the Copenhagen agre@@ en@@ ment , be &quot; new and additional &quot; to ensure that a supplementary effort is made without detriment to public development assistance .
Unfortunately , there is no agreement about what &quot; new and additional &quot; means .
Now that the European Commission has proposed a harmonisation , certain m@@ ember@@ -@@ States including France have blocked the procedure .
Today , everyone choo@@ ses what suits him / it best .
The European Commission , for example , took for its reference the year 2009 ; international finance is maintained and it is adding 150 mili@@ ons over 3 years as fast start finan@@ ce@@ . les finan@@ c@@ ements internation@@ aux sont mainten@@ us , et elle y aj@@ ou@@ te 150 millions sur tro@@ is ans au ti@@ tre des finan@@ c@@ ements fast start .
Other countries chose similar references in terms of year , or of level of public development assistance .
On the contrary , France regards the financing of all 2010 new projects as &quot; new and additional projects . &quot;
In other words , there is no reference to the costs of the preced@@ ing years , or globally , of public development assistance .
Con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely , the total support given by France to developing countries can remain stable ( or even decrease ) , France maintains that it is ob@@ serving its commitment in resp@@ est of &quot; new and additional &quot; finance .
Another crucial element , the separation of gifts and loans .
There , again , there is no rule and everyone choo@@ ses his own method of calculation .
Some , like France , consider that a Euro l@@ ent is equal to a Euro don@@ ated .
Clearly , this is difficult to justify ; the effort is not cop@@ arab@@ le@@ . l &apos;@@ effort n &apos;@@ est pas comparable .
If the custom of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable ( often projects linked to emissions which rely on more efficient technologies ) it is fall@@ acious to call a Euro which one will rec@@ ou@@ p as a don@@ ated Euro .. In addi@@ it@@ on , only the cost of a loan to the l@@ ender country should be taken into acc@@ unt as its commitment ( equal to the rate of interest ) .
But France need only reason that it &quot; ob@@ serves &quot; it commitment of 4@@ 20 million Euros making 9@@ 1.5 % of loans ( 3@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 8 million Euros ) and 8.@@ 5 % of donations ( 3@@ 6.@@ 1 million Euros ) - see European Union document for your own veri@@ f@@ c@@ ation@@ . elle &quot; resp@@ ec@@ te &quot; son engagement de 4@@ 20 millions d &apos;@@ euros en fa@@ is@@ ant 9@@ 1,5 % de pr@@ ê@@ ts ( 38@@ 9,@@ 8 millions d &apos;@@ euros ) et 8,@@ 5 % de d@@ ons ( 3@@ 6,@@ 1 millions d &apos;@@ euros ) - voir le document de l &apos;@@ U@@ E pour v@@ éri@@ fier par v@@ ous@@ -@@ m@@ ê@@ me .
It is the only country of the Union to use loans on such a massive scale .
Germany is lending 46 % , whilst Denmark , The Netherlands and Slovakia ( among others ) observe their ci@@ omm@@ itment with 100 % as donations .
In other words , when the great majority of the European Union gives 1 Euro to meet its commitment , France only gives 10 cen@@ times and regards its effort as comparable .
A nice s@@ lei@@ ght of hand !
Sum@@ ming up , France operates , in its fast start finance , double black@@ mail : on the one hand , on the evolution of the action over time and the other hand , on the reality of the financial ef@@ fort@@ . d &apos;@@ une part sur l &apos;@@ é@@ vol@@ ution de l &apos;@@ action dans le temp@@ s et d &apos;@@ au@@ tre part sur la ré@@ alit@@ é de l &apos;@@ effort finan@@ ci@@ er .
By only spending 3@@ 6.@@ 1 million Euros it thinks that it is generating a belief to be spending 4@@ 20 million &quot; new and additional &quot; Euros as it promised .
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance ( because it appears that it is Ber@@ cy that implemented the arbit@@ rage ) could have a dou@@ bly negative impact , both within the European Union ( why should the other m@@ ember@@ -@@ States continue to give , if lending is sufficient ? ) and in the negotiations , since the developing countries are not completely du@@ ped ....
The early finance chapter is only a small , relatively short-term matter in relation to all the discussions about the climate .
But it could be p@@ one more grain of sand in the huge machine , the UN@@ F@@ C@@ CC .
Let us hope that this is not the case .
In any event , it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early finance .
First of all , France could announce a change in its method of accoun@@ tan@@ cy for 2011 and 2012 in a spirit of hon@@ our@@ ing its commitments and of equity with other European Union countries .
But above all , France could promote the discussions about long-term financing st@@ akes ( another crucial chapter currently being discussed ) ; it is not possible to avoid the question of &quot; addi@@ tionality &quot; or of the method of accoun@@ tan@@ cy of lo@@ ans@@ . on n &apos;@@ é@@ chap@@ per@@ a pas à la question de &quot; l &apos;@@ addi@@ tion@@ alit@@ é &quot; ou du mode de comp@@ t@@ abili@@ sation des pr@@ ê@@ ts .
France could change its position to become as progres@@ is@@ ve on these st@@ akes as it it on others .
The hope therefore res@@ ts on the new Minister of the Environment , M@@ me Ko@@ sci@@ us@@ ko@@ -@@ M@@ oriz@@ et who will arrive in Cas@@ un next week .
A surprise announcement on France &apos;s fast start and on the view of &quot; addi@@ tionality &quot; and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed for progress in these discussions .
Al@@ ert on pesticides consum@@ ed by children .
According to a study published o Wednesday by the Future Gener@@ ations association ( form@@ el@@ ry Mo@@ vement for the Rights and Resp@@ ect of Future Gener@@ ations ) , a child of 10 consum@@ es in one day 81 different chemical substances .
The association which predic@@ ts that its results do not possess , in view of the small number of samples analy@@ sed , any significant statistical value , but illustr@@ ate the problem being dealt with , has bought in sper@@ markets of the O@@ ise and of Paris between July and September , the bas@@ ket of foodstuffs generally consum@@ ed in four meals by a child of ten .
These meals inc@@ l@@ du@@ ing official recommendations , five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables , three dairy products and 1.5 li@@ tres of water as well as delic@@ acies , were examined by clinical research labor@@ atories dealing with chemicals , pesticides , heavy metals and other poll@@ ut@@ ants .
The balance sheet is stag@@ gering : 81 chemical substances including 42 classified as potentially or probably car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and five classified as definitely car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic , as well as 37 substances able to indu@@ ce end@@ oc@@ r@@ ine dis@@ orders , according to studies by several institutions such as the International Canc@@ er Research Centre .
According to the Associ@@ a@@ it@@ on , even if , in almost all cases , the legal limits of each chemical substance are not exceeded , our inquiry shows that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic contam@@ in@@ ant is worrying .
For breakfast , but@@ ter and tea with milk alone contain over ten possible and three proven car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic resi@@ du@@ es and almost twenty resi@@ du@@ es potentially able to distur@@ b the hor@@ m@@ one system .
An app@@ le from Brazil contains traces of six chemical substances inclu@@ ing a f@@ ung@@ ici@@ de , prohibited in France .
The same applies to be@@ ans from Kenya included in a lun@@ che@@ on , in which the study found traces of a powerful in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide prohibited in the European Union .
In addi@@ it@@ on , min@@ ced ste@@ ak , c@@ ann@@ ed tuna and even a bag@@ u@@ ette and che@@ wing g@@ um contained pesticides and other chemicals .
Tap@@ water contained nit@@ rates and ch@@ lor@@ o@@ form .
For dinner , sal@@ mon ste@@ ak was the &quot; rich@@ est , &quot; with 34 chemical resi@@ du@@ es and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal in a micro@@ wave , was not exemp@@ t .
According to the study , the final risk for the consumer in this &quot; contam@@ in@@ ant cocktail &quot; is probably under@@ estimated .
For its part , the European Ec@@ ology Alliance - the Greens proposed , in view of the urgency of the situation , the introduction of a moratorium on the use of pesticides , in order to stop the growth of civilisation &apos;s diseases .
In July , a study by the European Food Safety Agency pointed to the presence of resi@@ du@@ es of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consum@@ ed in Europe including 76 in cer@@ eals .
