Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
The relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing activities in the Middle East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disp@@ uted two state solution .
Relations between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u have been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
The relationship between the two has further deterior@@ ated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran &apos;s atom@@ ic programme , .
In March , at the invitation of the Republic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time imp@@ ending in Israel .
In 9@@ 11 Call , Professor Ad@@ mits to Sho@@ oting Gir@@ l@@ friend
In a 9@@ 11 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told police he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their house .
Lam@@ b made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably up@@ set , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
In@@ side the home , officers found A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; body and a hand-@@ written note scri@@ b@@ b@@ led on a white legal p@@ ad : &quot; I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
There was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school &apos;s camp@@ us , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , in the door@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ ynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m.
He said Lam@@ b made the fat@@ eful 9@@ 11 call some@@ time after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and fac@@ ul@@ ty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
The details released by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a tal@@ ented but possibly troub@@ led teacher .
Stu@@ dents said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmi@@ dt himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History , which lists 17 fac@@ ul@@ ty members , and many students took courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of problems .
A student who pra@@ ised Lam@@ b , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ tery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
Another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14-@@ 15 academic year .
Lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only teaching two online classes .
Rec@@ ent changes in the university &apos;s hi@@ ring policies meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic ten@@ ure track to become an assi@@ stant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
Those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After fle@@ eing the camp@@ us , police later picked up Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he cross@@ ed back into Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
Before he could be ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 3@@ 8-@@ cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el John@@ son .
His car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though John@@ son said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 , in 2009 and taught ge@@ ography and education classes .
He received a doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
One of Lam@@ b &apos;s long@@ time friends described him as smart , char@@ is@@ m@@ atic and f@@ unny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
He was quite the hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b back then .
All the girls would m@@ elt when he was around , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson sub@@ ur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had apparently been dating for some time .
In the 9@@ 11 call , Lam@@ b said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
They had a dog named Ligh@@ tn@@ ing that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
Police said the dog was OK .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss &apos; ex-@@ husband , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; She was completely dev@@ ast@@ ated , &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and A@@ big@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played together in the occa@@ sional gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a di@@ mly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss the night of S@@ ept . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
There was no sign of anything am@@ is@@ s .
&quot; Just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
We were cutting up and thro@@ wing one-@@ lin@@ ers at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wi@@ t about them .
Schmi@@ dt , the sla@@ in professor , directed the first-@@ year seminar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three young children .
He studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his fr@@ at@@ ernity and student government .
On the Delta State camp@@ us in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including fac@@ ul@@ ty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght mem@@ orial .
Schmi@@ dt &apos;s wife , Li@@ z , and brother J@@ ef@@ f Schmi@@ dt also attended the vi@@ gi@@ l , during which the university cho@@ ir s@@ ang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Gra@@ ce . &quot;
Cl@@ asses resume Wednesday .
&quot; We &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i .
Associ@@ ated Press writers E@@ mi@@ ly Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , and Reb@@ ec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Or@@ le@@ ans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 9@@ 11 call after shooting Schmi@@ dt , and that while Lam@@ b referred to Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in the 9@@ 11 call , there is no indication the two ever married .
To@@ ys R Us Plans to H@@ ire Fe@@ wer Holiday Se@@ as@@ on Wor@@ kers

UN Chief S@@ ays There Is No Milit@@ ary Sol@@ ution in Syria
Secretary-General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s step@@ ped up military support for Syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five-@@ year conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
The U.@@ N@@ . chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.@@ N@@ . Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the General Assembly &apos;s minist@@ erial session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syri@@ an people and regional powers &quot; made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l Num@@ bers That Show Donald Tru@@ mp Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a fli@@ p-@@ fl@@ op@@ per .
Others have dis@@ missed him as a jo@@ ke .
And some are holding out for an imp@@ lo@@ sion .
But no matter how some Republic@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Tru@@ mp down from at@@ op the poll@@ s , it has@@ n &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national poll@@ s have shown Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l &apos;s nom@@ ination chances .
Of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
None of this is to say that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republic@@ an nom@@ ination .
Pun@@ di@@ ts point out that at this time in 2011 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising Herman C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nom@@ ination process .
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recogni@@ zing Tru@@ mp &apos;s staying power and beginning to un@@ load their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
Here are some recent pol@@ l numbers that suggest that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
Tru@@ mp &apos;s favor@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ mouth University pol@@ l showed only two in 10 Republic@@ ans had a positive view of the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
By mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republic@@ ans have a favor@@ able view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
Rou@@ ghly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac pol@@ l in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 percent of Republic@@ ans there had a favor@@ able view of Tru@@ mp .
Tw@@ o-@@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as the nomin@@ ee .
In a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of Republic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp were the nomin@@ ee .
Only two in 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set &quot; if he were the nomin@@ ee .
Only Ben Car@@ son generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent who say the same of Tru@@ mp ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bi@@ o with only 21 percent .
On the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republic@@ an voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; up@@ set &quot; if establishment favorite J@@ eb Bush becomes the nomin@@ ee .
A majority of Republic@@ ans don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp &apos;s tem@@ per@@ ament as a problem .
While Donald Tru@@ mp has been widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ ast and ins@@ ults , 52 percent of le@@ an@@ ed Republic@@ an voters nation@@ wide think that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per@@ ament to be president , according to Monday &apos;s AB@@ C News / Washington Post pol@@ l .
The same number holds in the fir@@ st@@ -in-@@ the-@@ nation c@@ auc@@ us state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 percent of Republic@@ ans think he has the personality to be comm@@ ander in chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independ@@ ents say his tem@@ per@@ ament does not belong in the White House , according to AB@@ C / Post .
Republic@@ an voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pun@@ dit h@@ ats , Republic@@ an voters think Tru@@ mp is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P nom@@ ination , four in 10 said Tru@@ mp was the best bet , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l out last week .
That &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on J@@ eb Bush in late July .
Full disclos@@ ure : G@@ O@@ P voters haven &apos;t had the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four in 10 Republic@@ ans picked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the nom@@ ination , v@@ s. only 28 percent for event@@ ual nomin@@ ee Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Still , it shows that a plur@@ ality of G@@ O@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
Even if Republic@@ ans r@@ alli@@ ed around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still be@@ ats almost everyone .
Some pun@@ di@@ ts point out that the sp@@ lin@@ tered field is likely contributing to Tru@@ mp &apos;s lead , while anti-@@ Tru@@ mp support is be spread diff@@ us@@ ely among more than a do@@ zen other candidates .
But a Mon@@ mouth University pol@@ l in early September shows that , in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head@@ -to-@@ head mat@@ ch@@ up between Tru@@ mp and most other Republic@@ an candidates , Tru@@ mp almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
He leads C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Ru@@ bi@@ o by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , J@@ eb Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e by 33 points each .
He &apos;s in a dead heat with T@@ ed Cruz .
The only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man by a wide 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head@@ -to-@@ head .
A bare majority of Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
A new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T pol@@ l out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have locked in their votes .
Obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
Still , Tru@@ mp &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der neur@@ o@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Tru@@ mp .
Six in 10 Republic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
Even since Donald Tru@@ mp called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 20@@ 16 conversation .
Some are worried that Tru@@ mp &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial His@@ pan@@ ic voters away from the Republic@@ an Party and damage re@@ br@@ anding efforts .
But according to Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post pol@@ l , six in 10 Republic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it seems Donald Tru@@ mp will remain too .
Fru@@ stration with government is climbing to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republic@@ an voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
Six in 10 Republic@@ ans in Monday &apos;s new AB@@ C / Post pol@@ l say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
And they are an@@ gr@@ y at Washington , too .
A Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg pol@@ l in I@@ ow@@ a from two weeks ago shows that three in four I@@ ow@@ a Republic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated with Republic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg – with a view over the North Sea mu@@ d@@ flat@@ s .
On this road one square met@@ re of a th@@ at@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3,@@ 300 .
&quot; On Sy@@ lt , the number of properties on offer is naturally limited , &quot; says a study – hence the high prices .
This new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square met@@ re .
Of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square met@@ re for student dig@@ s in Munich is not really low .
Compar@@ ed with Germany &apos;s top areas , however , this price seems likes pe@@ an@@ uts .
Property service Eng@@ el &amp; Vol@@ kers has published a leag@@ ue table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square met@@ re .
More than € 10,000 is nothing there - per quare met@@ re , mind you .
O@@ k , if you can &apos;t afford it ...
In@@ ci@@ dentally , for once Munich is not in the lead .
Champ@@ ions League : Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
Double goal sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll .
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller p@@ aved the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bayern at Ol@@ yp@@ i@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it got better .
A confident start to the Champ@@ ions League season .
World champ@@ ions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e brought about a dream start to their &quot; Milan Mission &quot; in the se@@ e@@ thing cau@@ l@@ dr@@ on at Pi@@ re@@ aus .
Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos;s team won their opening match in the Champ@@ ions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to Müller &apos;s bra@@ ce ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ e &apos;s goal ( 8@@ 9th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The t@@ wel@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 20@@ 16 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the tro@@ phy back to Munich .
With his 28@@ th goal in the Champ@@ ions League , Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gra@@ cious help of O@@ ly@@ mi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ ie Rober@@ to , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
&quot; We aren &apos;t going to under@@ estimate them , &quot; promised Bayern cap@@ tain Phil@@ li@@ pp L@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis Stadium in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich player kept his word .
They demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won their six most recent premi@@ ere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ le@@ tico Madrid and Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
In 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund st@@ umb@@ led here too .
But Bayern , un@@ defe@@ ated in seven Europa Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went to work bol@@ dly , but often too un@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
Att@@ acks were too often initiated by bringing left w@@ inger Dou@@ glas Costa , who rarely got past former Br@@ uns@@ wick player Om@@ ar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , into play .
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field dro@@ ve into the top left corner of the goal .
In the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in the first half .
First when Olymp@@ i@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the P@@ ole &apos;s he@@ ader from the line in the 26@@ th minute .
Then with a shot which the go@@ al@@ ie par@@ ried with his kne@@ e in the 35@@ th minute .
Although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus were able to need@@ le them .
But they could count on go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er .
For example when he ste@@ ered a shot from Ide@@ ye over the cross@@ bar in the 5@@ 6th minute .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a four-@@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , back in the squ@@ ad following mus@@ cle problems , initially sat on the si@@ delines .
The world cup her@@ o had only been given the green light following final training , said Sport@@ ing Director Matthias S@@ ammer on Sky : &quot; If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being mal@@ icious &quot; .
At the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the stri@@ cken Le@@ wand@@ owski in the 5@@ 9th minute .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal in the 7@@ 6th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; Müller put another one in with a penalty .
Before the match there was a ri@@ ot in the stadium .
After a small group of Bayern fans , some wearing mas@@ ks , had apparently prov@@ oked supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus from behind their f@@ ence with words and gest@@ ures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
At least one Bayern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
Smo@@ kers at a greater risk of losing teeth
Smo@@ kers damage not only their l@@ ungs but also their teeth , concludes a long-term study in Pots@@ dam .
The good news is : if you give up the risk decre@@ ases fast .
Smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This emerg@@ es from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for N@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Pots@@ dam .
Compar@@ ed to non-@@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely is between 2.5 and 3.@@ 6 times higher for smo@@ kers .
The scientists monitored more than 23@@ ,@@ 300 participants .
The main reasons for t@@ ooth loss are c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
Smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphasise the authors .
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent g@@ um infl@@ amm@@ ation in smo@@ kers .
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of c@@ aries .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research &quot; .
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more dro@@ ps to the level of non-@@ smo@@ kers &apos; , declared lead author Thomas Di@@ et@@ rich of the University of Birmingham in England .
People should be persu@@ aded to become non-@@ smo@@ kers , declared study leader H@@ einer Bo@@ eing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; Smoking shor@@ tens the li@@ fes@@ p@@ an &quot; .
Not smoking is good for the l@@ ungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by t@@ oo@@ th@@ less@@ ness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
Ear@@ lier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early t@@ ooth loss .
The new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
Arch@@ ae@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists from the Roman German@@ ic Museum have un@@ earth@@ ed sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Bou@@ levard is being constructed , said museum Director Mar@@ cus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
Hist@@ ori@@ ans have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
The museum , as the department for archaeological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
The archae@@ ologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rh@@ ein Bou@@ levard .
It is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a c@@ emet@@ ery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belong@@ ed to the church , has also been discovered .
Young woman hit by goods train
After a young woman met with an accident at the station in Gei@@ l@@ enk@@ ir@@ chen@@ -@@ Lin@@ dern , police are asking for help from the general public .
Early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman cross@@ ed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
According to the Federal police she suffered severe in@@ jur@@ ies from the accident .
She was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by am@@ bul@@ ance .
Inv@@ es@@ tig@@ ating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
It is possible that the event was observed by witn@@ esses or residents may have heard something .
This may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lin@@ dern station , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ äck@@ er@@ weg , Th@@ om@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Strasse ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
Any information that can be provided about the cause of the accident can be given by calling the free 24-hour police hot@@ line on 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88 8@@ 000 or at any police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in contro@@ vers@@ y over TT@@ IP
To def@@ use the contro@@ vers@@ y over the planned Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current arbitr@@ ation system .
According to this , the disp@@ uted private arbitr@@ ation board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which corresponds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
&quot; We want to set up a system which citizens trust , &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner , C@@ ec@@ ili@@ a Mal@@ ström , when introducing it .
The Swe@@ de plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German government has announced its support .
The creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
Plans for reform of the current arbitr@@ ation procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come in equal propor@@ tions from the EU , the USA and from non-@@ member countries .
For the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
This would allow for appe@@ als to be made against jud@@ gements .
Up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the arbitr@@ ator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , comm@@ ented Mal@@ ström .
In the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
In this , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clear@@ ed up .
Invest@@ or State Dis@@ p@@ ute Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the sti@@ ff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
Tradi@@ tional arbitr@@ ation courts are criticised by ad@@ vers@@ aries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax pay@@ ers , make national laws n@@ ull and void , or enforce a lower@@ ing of consumer and environmental protection standards .
In initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organisations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission &apos;s proposals inadequate .
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
The German Secretary of State for the Economy , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SP@@ D ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Econom@@ ics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el developed with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private arbitr@@ ation courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ ström &apos;s plans .
The European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged , they said .
When talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
Neg@@ oti@@ ations have been taking place since the middle of 2013 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
It was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
This date is no longer ten@@ able .
Ex@@ qu@@ isite folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
Ele@@ ven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens si@@ ts on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in Cologne .
Bes@@ ide him stands a fli@@ p chart on which the sh@@ y-@@ seem@@ ing folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an in fel@@ t-@@ tip pen .
The entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ mer@@ ised by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s performance .
Ref@@ err@@ ing to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his me@@ ticul@@ ously and sub@@ tly contri@@ ved songs .
Where they origin@@ ated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
Since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved himself to be a wonder@@ fully creative nut@@ case .
His third album , &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; , released in 2003 , features cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might dri@@ ft at any time into amazing op@@ ul@@ ence .
Rum@@ our has it that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
But in 2004 in the Rhine area , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; came out , bur@@ sting positive expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens seems to have down@@ sized here .
Pla@@ ying live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
One year later the New Yor@@ k-@@ based musi@@ cian returns to his series .
With &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : Come On Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ ise &quot; ) in 2005 , a widely acc@@ laimed master@@ piece is released .
Ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic sophistic@@ ation .
The album clim@@ bs the American Bill@@ board charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
After extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then serves up &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , an elabor@@ ate electronic set piece .
This sixth proper studio album is still broadly or@@ chest@@ rated , but supported by programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or be@@ ats and plays with a variety of effects and ech@@ oes .
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colourful spectac@@ les with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent stage decor@@ ations .
Currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is tour@@ ing Germany as part of a five-@@ man band .
Hamburg Mehr kept in the dark !
Since March the theatre has primarily presented &quot; Carri@@ e and L@@ ow@@ ell &quot; .
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
Without direc@@ ting a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enrich@@ ed album .
From the audience one can hear : the performance is more &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and it makes you want to &quot; ch@@ u@@ ck away the album &quot; .
Only with his en@@ core does St@@ ev@@ ens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs acous@@ tically and finally take a bow to th@@ under@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n to make de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s de@@ but at PM@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ en@@ ly awa@@ ited
New Labour leader Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his de@@ but at Prime Minister &apos;s Questions later , taking on David Cam@@ eron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six all@@ ot@@ ted questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance likely to be closely scrut@@ in@@ ised by the media and Labour MP@@ s .
He has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly show@@ piece .
He has also said he could ski@@ p some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cab@@ inet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual congress on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of T@@ ory MP@@ s and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
A spo@@ kes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the B@@ attle of Britain . &quot;
But a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told BBC Two &apos;s News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ arch@@ y should be abolished .
N@@ early a do@@ zen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , c@@ iting differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political correspon@@ dent Rob@@ in Br@@ ant says policy differences are also &quot; st@@ acking up &quot; within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment over its position on the European Union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
H@@ ours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions secret@@ ary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cam@@ eron has faced across the des@@ patch box over the past decade since he became T@@ ory leader .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to ask Mr Cam@@ eron and has been given more than 30@@ ,000 suggestions .
The Is@@ ling@@ ton North M@@ P has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; re@@ part@@ ee &quot; and trading bar@@ bs , instead v@@ owing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow business secret@@ ary , will dep@@ u@@ tise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cam@@ eron is travelling abroad .
He has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had appro@@ ached the Commons Spe@@ aker John Ber@@ cow to discuss the issue .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cam@@ eron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy &quot; style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
Since it was first tel@@ ev@@ ised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ometer of a leader &apos;s jud@@ gement , their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MP@@ s although critics have argued it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and is in need of far-reaching reforms .

Po@@ und rises as UK wage growth acceler@@ ates
The po@@ und j@@ ump@@ ed following data showing a pick@@ -up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
Between May and July , UK earnings excluding bon@@ uses grew 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period last year .
The rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
Ster@@ ling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 .
The FT@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the stand@@ -@@ out stock on the market , j@@ umping 20 % after it received a bid approach from ri@@ val AB In@@ Bev .
A deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as Bud@@ wei@@ ser , Stell@@ a Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from ri@@ val luxury goods group Ri@@ chem@@ ont .
Ri@@ chem@@ ont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
Shar@@ es in Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ b@@ n through a share placement as part of its deb@@ t-@@ cutting strategy .
Shar@@ es in packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest fall@@ ers on the index , down 4.@@ 3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose 3.1 % after the spor@@ ts@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jump in half-@@ year pre-@@ tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6@@ m.
J@@ D Sports bo@@ ss says higher wages could h@@ urt expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the po@@ ckets of potential consumers . &quot;
But that spending power is unlikely to out@@ wei@@ gh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
The costs could hit J@@ D Sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber in the capital city : on a B@@ ie@@ ber ex@@ pedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .
A ridicul@@ ous 21 years young , a wi@@ mp@@ y k@@ id with a too trendy hair@@ cut .
The guy with the plat@@ in@@ um bl@@ ond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
Prob@@ ably even more .
At the moment Mon@@ si@@ eur B@@ ie@@ ber is in Berlin .
And the under-@@ 17 generation is going ber@@ ser@@ k .
Like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
The 15-@@ year-old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carl@@ ton .
Not so bad .
H@@ und@@ reds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
Inclu@@ ding E@@ va and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
But the Pol@@ es have been sitting on the cold stone sl@@ ab in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Pots@@ damer Platz since 7 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning .
The B@@ ie@@ ber building : their i@@ do@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of post@@ ers in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in six months .
At least .
She says : &quot; My Vi@@ kt@@ oria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the gramm@@ ar school at the moment . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m fulfilling her dream for her . &quot;
Comp@@ ulsory education ?
Who wants that ?
Not the fans .
Nor B@@ ie@@ ber himself .
He is financially secure anyway .
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bow@@ l , a two-@@ year deal with an anti-@@ spot company po@@ urs many many dollars into B@@ ie@@ ber &apos;s account .
And for every d@@ oll that looks like him and passes over the counter B@@ ie@@ ber c@@ ash@@ es in as well .
When Jus@@ tin B@@ ie@@ ber drinks coffee people g@@ og@@ gle through the window .
He has lo@@ oted more than a hundred million like that .
Some say the h@@ ype goes too far .
Others point out that after all B@@ ie@@ ber is char@@ ting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number one .
B@@ ie@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
At least that &apos;s what he says .
P@@ eg@@ ida po@@ ster suggests the idea of pot@@ ato don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s to Leb@@ anese man
Pot@@ at@@ oes or don@@ er k@@ eb@@ ab ?
You can have both – in the pot@@ ato k@@ eb@@ ab that Ol@@ den@@ burg snack bar owner H@@ ani Al@@ ha@@ y has created .
In@@ spired by the s@@ logan &quot; pot@@ at@@ oes instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; on a P@@ eg@@ ida movement po@@ ster , Al@@ ha@@ y put pot@@ at@@ oes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
A po@@ ster at a P@@ eg@@ ida demonstration with the s@@ logan &quot; Pot@@ at@@ oes instead of k@@ eb@@ ab@@ s &quot; which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
Since then a sp@@ it laden with meat and pot@@ at@@ oes has been rot@@ ating in his shop .
&quot; That is multi-@@ cultural food ! &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
Now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich .
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
Because of this , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how many pot@@ at@@ oes the sp@@ it holds .
Just enough so that , &quot; They taste much better together , &quot; he reck@@ ons .
Customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding .
Met@@ cash laun@@ ches grass@@ roots campaign to fight Al@@ di inc@@ ur@@ sion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di ons@@ lau@@ ght in South Australia and Western Australia .
Gro@@ cer@@ y wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has k@@ ic@@ ked off a grass@@ roots campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
As Al@@ di prepar@@ es to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A super@@ markets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am and social media marketing and events such as the Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
IG@@ A retail@@ ers and suppliers are j@@ umping on board , with brands such as D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ -based ice cream maker S@@ imm@@ o &apos;s offering taste testing at IG@@ A stores and store owners selling dis@@ counted South Australian football leag@@ ue tickets to loy@@ al customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liqu@@ or and hardware wholes@@ aler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
There is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A store foot@@ print and generate higher profit marg@@ ins than Met@@ cash &apos;s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian sh@@ opp@@ ers are not@@ ori@@ ously par@@ o@@ chi@@ al and IG@@ A retail@@ ers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in W@@ A compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
However , an@@ alyst@@ s such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the gro@@ cer@@ y market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retail@@ ers .
In a report this week , Morgan Stan@@ ley analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath estimated that IG@@ A retail@@ ers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in W@@ A next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss of food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales and volumes on Met@@ cash &apos;s high fix@@ ed-@@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
At the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Ro@@ y Morgan survey found IG@@ A sh@@ opp@@ ers were most loy@@ al .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 .
Last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Mel@@ bour@@ ne that Met@@ cash could &quot; highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has dec@@ lined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos; comments .
But it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member cont@@ acted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash &apos;s food and gro@@ cer@@ y business , which supplies about 1200 IG@@ A retail@@ ers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating del@@ ever@@ age as sales and marg@@ ins come under pressure .
However , the wholes@@ aler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shel@@ f prices at Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping IG@@ A retail@@ ers refur@@ b@@ ish stores by adding fast@@ er-@@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label gro@@ c@@ eries .
Met@@ cash chief executive I@@ an Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refur@@ bish@@ ment programs are gaining trac@@ tion and is hoping the wholes@@ aler will return to underlying profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ al@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been the coll@@ ater@@ al damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os and deserves ku@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve He@@ al@@ y .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the tal@@ ented du@@ o regularly referred to as the &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was dra@@ g@@ ged into an un@@ welcome spot@@ light by the in@@ famous Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os s@@ ledge of St@@ an Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Ma@@ sters .
In a f@@ ier@@ y quali@@ fying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his oppon@@ ent Ry@@ an Har@@ ris@@ on twice had to be separated by the chair ump@@ ire , with Har@@ ris@@ on declar@@ ing : &quot; Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka should &apos;ve deck@@ ed Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os , and I should deck that k@@ id . &quot;
While he was last seen sm@@ ash@@ ing a rac@@ quet after cr@@ amp fo@@ iled a potential US Open up@@ set of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis has been defended staun@@ ch@@ ly by He@@ al@@ y .
The teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with S@@ am Gro@@ th for the second sing@@ les ber@@ th behind Bern@@ ard Tom@@ ic in the Dav@@ is Cup semi-@@ final against Britain .
&quot; One thing I do feel quite ke@@ en@@ ly about is I think Th@@ an@@ asi &apos;s been dra@@ g@@ ged into the fra@@ y a little bit , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
He did break a rac@@ quet when he lost when he cr@@ amp@@ ed in the US , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a rac@@ quet out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he w@@ ouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
But , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances in the US with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
He &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and I just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
He &apos;s a very mature 19@@ -@@ year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he has@@ n &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the lo@@ cker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to over@@ look Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , descri@@ bing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ ber@@ ran to return as a long-term fix@@ ture in the team .
&quot; First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ al@@ y said .
And I think N@@ ick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the lim@@ eli@@ ght where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe migrant crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , se@@ als border , det@@ ains migrants
Dec@@ lar@@ ing a state of emergency , Hungary se@@ aled off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and det@@ ained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants po@@ uring in .
Chaos en@@ su@@ ed at the border , as hundreds of migrants pil@@ ed up in a no man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
Stu@@ ck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; check@@ points , those fle@@ eing violence in their hom@@ el@@ ands pit@@ ched t@@ ents and settled in .
But frustr@@ ations were on the rise .
As a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ ver@@ ed above , migrants chan@@ ted &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ ou@@ ted ins@@ ults at Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
Some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not coll@@ ater@@ al damage .
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
The tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hung@@ ari@@ an-@@ Serbian border came a day after the 28@@ -@@ nation blo@@ c failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people seeking refuge in overwhel@@ med Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an event@@ ual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120@@ ,000 more refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neigh@@ b@@ ors .
Tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
Meanwhile , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a ra@@ z@@ or-@@ wire f@@ ence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a f@@ ence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Char@@ lie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ m@@ ates were en@@ listed in the race to finish the ra@@ z@@ or wire f@@ ence between Hungary and Serbia .
In the last few months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for migrants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Vi@@ ktor Or@@ ban , however , has insi@@ sted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharp@@ ly at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
The new laws that took effect at mid@@ night in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-@@ meter ( 13@@ -@@ foot ) ra@@ z@@ or-@@ wire f@@ ence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convic@@ ted human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; Due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es a state of crisis , &quot; government spo@@ kes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
We are very clear on this : Il@@ legal border crossing is a crime .
Techni@@ cally , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ por@@ ters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , hom@@ eland security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
They got across by damaging the f@@ ence , are now in police cust@@ ody and are being charged with committ@@ ing off@@ enses under the new laws .
Auth@@ orities are quickly rep@@ air@@ ing the f@@ ence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deplo@@ ying a train car covered with ra@@ z@@ or wire to close one of them .
Chaos en@@ velop@@ ed the main border crossing near Ro@@ sz@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crow@@ ds pressed to squ@@ ee@@ ze inside .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary , saying they were ref@@ using food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary .
El@@ ection 20@@ 16 : H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead over Bern@@ ie S@@ anders cut by half in national pol@@ l
For@@ mer Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double-@@ dig@@ it lead in the Democratic race for the nom@@ ination nation@@ ally , but Sen@@ . Bern@@ ie S@@ anders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while S@@ anders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Jo@@ e Bi@@ den , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
More than five months before the start of the primary cont@@ ests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
But Clinton &apos;s back@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
Since last month &apos;s C@@ BS News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have nar@@ row@@ ed .
Her support among men has dropped considerably and S@@ anders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and she and S@@ anders are now even .
However , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders by double-@@ dig@@ its among liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5-@@ point edge with this group .
About half of Democratic primary voters nation@@ wide say they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if she became the party &apos;s nomin@@ ee .
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nomin@@ ee .
Six percent would not support her .
Perhaps not surpris@@ ingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
Vie@@ ws are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support her .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusias@@ tically back Clinton , fewer Republic@@ an voters say that about their fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open-@@ ended question why they want her to be the nomin@@ ee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Agreement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also c@@ ited .
As the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nom@@ ination , Bi@@ den is the top pick .
Among Clinton supporters , more than half say Bi@@ den would be their second choice , far ahead of S@@ anders .
If Bi@@ den choo@@ ses not to run for the Democratic nom@@ ination , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead over S@@ anders wi@@ dens , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
Fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
Still , when asked which is more important in a nomin@@ ee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
Simil@@ ar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nomin@@ ee to these primary voters .
The Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
Maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den does the best of the three on hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
Thir@@ ty percent of Democratic primary voters don &apos;t think Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as in line with their views ide@@ ologically .
On all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
As questions continue about H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has@@ n &apos;t imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
But it &apos;s a different story among the American public overall .
Hal@@ f of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
The public &apos;s views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
Most Americans say the email contro@@ vers@@ y has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
It is mainly Republic@@ ans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
Six@@ ty-@@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy .
At the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nation@@ wide don &apos;t see Tru@@ mp as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy either .
Both Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , get good marks on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on hon@@ esty .
More see S@@ anders as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in national pol@@ l
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the newest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new pol@@ l , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ ung@@ ing for a foo@@ th@@ old
Republic@@ an voters nation@@ wide continue to back Tru@@ mp in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the pol@@ l out Tuesday .
But Car@@ son rock@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
The survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demographic groups , ed@@ ging out Tru@@ mp among col@@ le@@ ge-@@ educated Republic@@ an voters .
The rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o Go@@ v. John Ka@@ sich , has sli@@ pped behind with Wis@@ cons@@ in Go@@ v. Scott Wal@@ ker falling far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
For@@ mer Florida Go@@ v. J@@ eb Bush , former Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Go@@ v. Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ . Marco Ru@@ bi@@ o all tied for third place with 6 % .
The margin of error for the 3@@ 7@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republic@@ an voters in this newest pol@@ l is pl@@ us-@@ or-@@ min@@ us 6 % , and was conducted S@@ ept .
The latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the poll@@ s -- landing at 19 % support among Republic@@ ans , behind Tru@@ mp &apos;s 32 % support .
The latest pol@@ l from AB@@ C News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
Fac@@ ing a rising Car@@ son last week , Tru@@ mp took some pot@@ shots at the reti@@ red neur@@ o@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , even as Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for ques@@ tioning Tru@@ mp &apos;s faith .
&quot; We need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign stop in I@@ ow@@ a .
Ple@@ as@@ ant temperatures for bathing : the eastern Mediterranean is currently as warm as 29 degrees
Even if peak levels are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water .
A di@@ p in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea can only be a brief treat with temperatures at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Many people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic this week is a maximum of 18 degrees , according to the German met@@ e@@ or@@ ological office ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
The Mediterranean , by contrast , offers suitable temperatures for bathing : in the east they are as high as 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic peak temperatures are 25 degrees , and in France 23 degrees .
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
Five fr@@ at@@ ernity members charged in death of Bar@@ uch College fresh@@ man
N@@ early two years after a college student died during a fr@@ at@@ ernity ha@@ zing rit@@ ual in P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania &apos;s Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
Members of New York City &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i Delta P@@ si fr@@ at@@ ernity brut@@ ally ass@@ aul@@ ted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initi@@ ation rit@@ e in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
Offici@@ als said he was blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , s@@ add@@ led with a 30-@@ po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained that his head h@@ urt then fell un@@ conscious .
P@@ i Delta P@@ si fr@@ at@@ ernity members did not call 9@@ 11 after Den@@ g passed out , and alle@@ ge@@ dly wa@@ ited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
They did , however , find time to change Den@@ g &apos;s clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact An@@ dy Men@@ g , the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wag@@ ner said at a news conference .
&quot; At this point , members began to hide par@@ aph@@ ern@@ alia and basically put the fr@@ at@@ ernity &apos;s well-being over that of Michael Den@@ g &apos;s , &quot; Chief Wag@@ ner said .
He could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning .
According to an au@@ top@@ sy report , Den@@ g was subjected to repeated bl@@ unt force trau@@ ma to his head , tor@@ so , and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; Too many families have been dev@@ ast@@ ated as a result of fr@@ at@@ ernity ha@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from ha@@ zing since 1970 , &quot; Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ney representing Den@@ g &apos;s family , said in a statement .
Fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
A Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended third-@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Thir@@ ty-@@ two other fr@@ at@@ ernity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with ass@@ ault ha@@ zing and criminal con@@ spi@@ racy .
&quot; We want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanc@@ tioned it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; Wag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the fr@@ at@@ ernity and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
Here &apos;s what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hi@@ ke will come and the bul@@ l market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond yiel@@ ds will climb and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
This we know .
What we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
For the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hi@@ ke and as long as 86 months .
The Federal Reserve &apos;s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That &apos;s why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigor@@ ously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory of how long it will take to norm@@ alize .
There are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
In the end , however , market participants may find that all the rat@@ e-@@ hi@@ ke f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
&quot; The first hi@@ ke from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; Juli@@ an J@@ ess@@ op , chief global econom@@ ist at Capital Econom@@ ics , said in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that many seem to fear .
That &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
Here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
As the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip@@ ation of rate hi@@ kes can make things vol@@ atile for a while .
Once the hi@@ ke h@@ its , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to st@@ all 12-@@ 24 months after the first hi@@ ke , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; Deutsche Bank an@@ alyst@@ s said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hi@@ kes .
More specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharp@@ ly - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hi@@ ke , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.@@ 6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis B@@ ob Dol@@ l , chief equity strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , posted on Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pron@@ ounced later in the rat@@ e-@@ hiking cycle and returns begin to dimin@@ ish .
Rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hi@@ kes often help them along .
In the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ sten a recession .
Most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hi@@ ke .
According to Deutsche Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate hi@@ kes since 1950 , only twice has nomin@@ al year over year GDP been below 4.@@ 5 percent .
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlan@@ ta Fed .
Hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; Deutsche said .
Market participants have been bra@@ cing for a Fed hi@@ ke all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
While many strateg@@ ists and economists believe the F@@ OM@@ C could approve a hi@@ ke at this meeting , fut@@ ures trading indicates just a 25 percent prob@@ ability .
&quot; In our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing le@@ verage with GDP ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing prer@@ ec@@ ession peaks very quickly post the recovery comm@@ encing , &quot; the report said .
By contrast this has been a uniqu@@ ely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has wa@@ ited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
Fix@@ ed income also has been vol@@ atile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hi@@ ke , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equi@@ ties experience .
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
For bonds , it does seem yiel@@ ds change direction immediately as the first hi@@ ke / cut in the cycle arri@@ ves .
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yiel@@ ds fall immediately , &quot; Deutsche said .
Charles Schw@@ ab strateg@@ ists believe the hi@@ ke in rates will cause yiel@@ ds between lon@@ ger@@ - and shor@@ ter-@@ dated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ tening the cur@@ ve .
High-@@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cau@@ tious about stret@@ ching for yield , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , said in an analysis .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
&quot; In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of ti@@ ghter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term interest rates are up , the yield cur@@ ve is f@@ latter , credit spre@@ ads have wi@@ dened and vol@@ atility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
Bro@@ adly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
M@@ ultin@@ ation@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; History shows that &apos; quality &apos; stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hi@@ ke , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ alyst@@ s said in a report for clients .
Fir@@ ms with strong balance sheets out@@ pac@@ ed weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hi@@ kes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low vol@@ atility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counter@@ parts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
Deb@@ t will become a big issue .
Companies with a high percentage of flo@@ ating rate debt stand to lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
Out@@ side pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
Sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yiel@@ ds at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic F@@ M says M@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham
Conserv@@ ative M@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham criticised station for &apos; du@@ mb@@ ing down@@ &apos;
Ar@@ gues it &apos;s becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from commercial ri@@ val
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just ri@@ p off the Br@@ its
Col@@ leag@@ ue Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins M@@ P attacked The Vo@@ ice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; Classic F@@ M , a leading M@@ P has claimed , p@@ iling fresh pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that it does something that commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
Conserv@@ ative M@@ P Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC bo@@ ss@@ es that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from its commercial ri@@ val .
&quot; Radio 3 seems to be - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; du@@ mb@@ ing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into Classic F@@ M , &quot; he said .
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
So , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just m@@ im@@ icking what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ val when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
And it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; And also , Radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commission@@ ing new works I think is also really important , &quot; he said .
Ear@@ lier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audi@@ ences than it did in the past , because Brit@@ ons are less educated about classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC &apos;s output which came under fire for tre@@ ading on the to@@ es of commercial ri@@ vals , during the Culture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
T@@ ory M@@ P Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Vo@@ ice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma F@@ ai@@ th and Bo@@ y George as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly BBC way . &quot;
He added that he wants the Corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in-house stable &quot; next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or spending licence fee pay@@ ers &apos; money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased at slow@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bol@@ stered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Exper@@ ts believe November &apos;s Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and turning many of Britain &apos;s high streets into gh@@ o@@ st towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are le@@ vel@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
Exper@@ ts say there are signs that online sales are le@@ vel@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to ration@@ alise over time , &apos; An@@ dy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of IM@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
He explained that online sales were bol@@ stered three years ago when sh@@ opp@@ ers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contex@@ ts , such as on the sofa .
But now that is plat@@ e@@ au@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
The Black Friday phenomenon , which has been imported from America , is being c@@ ited as one of the reasons behind the s@@ lowing sales .
Exper@@ ts believe sh@@ opp@@ ers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of sh@@ opp@@ ers flo@@ cked to their computers to sn@@ ap up deals cr@@ ash@@ ing a number of retail@@ ers websites .
Exper@@ ts believe Black Friday , which saw sh@@ opp@@ ers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding sh@@ opp@@ ers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
For some products , such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in Mec@@ ca c@@ ran@@ e crash as B@@ in Laden family sanc@@ tioned
Bo@@ dies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first f@@ uner@@ als take place in Mec@@ ca

The Health Ministry said a total of 3@@ 94 people were also injured after the c@@ ran@@ e cr@@ ashed down
Car@@ ried alo@@ ft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a c@@ ran@@ e collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand mos@@ que .
Dres@@ sed largely in white , mo@@ ur@@ ners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ aiss@@ em c@@ emet@@ ery .
The sad possession passed by the hol@@ y site , where just days earlier a construction c@@ ran@@ e cr@@ ashed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and top@@ pled onto wor@@ ship@@ ers .

Mr Ak@@ ram had been in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j pilgri@@ ma@@ ge .
Saudi officials have already v@@ owed that the ha@@ j@@ j to Mec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
Today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin@@ la@@ din Group should not have left the c@@ ran@@ e &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
An Arab@@ ic version of the decre@@ e , carried by the state-@@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ la@@ din Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
The news agency &apos;s English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
Ear@@ lier this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the c@@ ran@@ e to t@@ opp@@ le into a courtyard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the ha@@ j@@ j pilgri@@ ma@@ ge later this month .
Bin@@ la@@ din Group has not released any statements about the c@@ ran@@ e collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .

Al Q@@ ai@@ da &apos;s late leader Os@@ ama bin Laden was a ren@@ eg@@ ade son di@@ sow@@ ned by the family in the 1990s .
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgri@@ ma@@ ge , which is required at least once in the life of every ab@@ le-@@ bo@@ died Muslim .
Offici@@ als said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
Offici@@ als ordered one million ri@@ y@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4@@ ,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .

Ver@@ oni@@ que La@@ ury , new chief executive of King@@ fis@@ her , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at ro@@ ck-@@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
As a result , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while closing 60 B &amp; Q out@@ lets .
Mrs La@@ ury said she wants more women to be employed in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
Currently the majority of staff are men .
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs La@@ ury said : &quot; We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
We need to move more towards a balance .
Fundament@@ ally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
Women play a big part in the decision-making process .
Mrs La@@ ury , who is one of only five women at the hel@@ m of Britain &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also restruc@@ tured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staff@@ ed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs La@@ ury said : &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
King@@ fis@@ her posted a fall in both half-@@ year profit and sales after the group shoul@@ dered the cost of sh@@ utting stores .
As a result of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , which owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , is opening 200 new stores
Offici@@ als from A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ ob in court for breach of trust
Two officials from the Austrian vol@@ leyball run@@ n@@ er-@@ up champion team A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ ob attended the K@@ lagen@@ fur@@ t regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax ev@@ asion .
The def@@ end@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
One of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
He was legally acqu@@ itted of this charge in May .
The current case was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
According to senior Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the def@@ end@@ ants used mon@@ ies from the club &apos;s accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
The loss is estimated at around € 400@@ ,000 .
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences .
The Chair@@ woman of the L@@ ay Ju@@ dge Sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be postponed .
It will be tried at a later date .
On the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disadvantage
The sports officials had only offset expense allow@@ ances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - li@@ abilities in 2001 amoun@@ ted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( around € 4@@ 4@@ ,000 ) .
&quot; At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ents , who makes his living as an audi@@ tor of large companies for the tax authorities .
With his colleague and co-@@ def@@ endant , he had then resolved to undertake this task .
With all the risks .
&quot; We advanced money and deposi@@ ted our life insurance policies with the bank as security , &quot; he said during the examination .
It was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
Furthermore , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spective payment of the expense allow@@ ance back to 1991 was agreed .
As a result , a part of the expense allow@@ ance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
This is why general and not detailed deb@@ it entries appeared , was the former chairman &apos;s explanation for the processes .
The two def@@ end@@ ants managed the accounts and pass@@ books together , said the second def@@ endant .
The Ju@@ dge asked why the payments had not been disclos@@ ed to the club in detail .
The club was not interested in details of the financial arrangements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
When investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred into the club &apos;s account .
Those were reserves , explained the def@@ endant .
This securities account was run in the name of the two def@@ end@@ ants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
&quot; Why ? &quot; the Ju@@ dge wanted to know .
There was no answer to this for a long time .
Then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
H@@ ad something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Pro@@ sec@@ utor put to the room .
The co-@@ def@@ endant knew about it , the official justified himself .
The purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
&quot; Why compensation for damages ? &quot; the Ju@@ dge and the State Pro@@ sec@@ utor wanted to know .
In response , the first def@@ endant said that he had dis@@ agreed with this wording because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
But what can I do when the lawyer says , &quot; This lets us all off the h@@ ook &quot; ?
&quot; Am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in sal@@ ary , he had only charged for mi@@ le@@ age and a per di@@ em allow@@ ance .
The club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ em allow@@ ances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
The def@@ end@@ ants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the earlier years .
This was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
The second def@@ endant had also obtained a mi@@ le@@ age allow@@ ance .
All adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in Völker@@ markt to the bank in Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
The trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witn@@ esses .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard cutting a further 30@@ ,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the split@@ ting of the company .
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
As part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25@@ ,000 and 30@@ ,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
This should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company disclos@@ ed on Tuesday .
The step will lead to a one-@@ off charge of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
At the end of the 2013 / 14 business year HP still employed around 30@@ 2@@ ,000 staff .
At the end of trading He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard shares had fallen by 2.@@ 3 percent .
The group based in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , California , which initially grew through its printer sales , is currently split@@ ting its business : this year the computer and printer side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
Both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
Rep@@ e@@ at@@ edly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently aff@@ lic@@ ted the world &apos;s second-@@ largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ ovo .
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and pr@@ inters fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
R@@ even@@ ue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 2@@ 5.@@ 4 billion .
This means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive lay@@ off@@ s .
The 7@@ 6-@@ year-old business headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying sm@@ art@@ phones and tab@@ lets instead of conventional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s plans for restructuring include around 5@@ 5,000 job losses .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts : the majority support anti IS@@ IS training mission
The majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
Six@@ ty-@@ one percent re@@ acted positively to other countries carrying out air attacks against IS@@ IS in Iraq and Syria .
Tw@@ enty-@@ four percent are against interven@@ ing in the conflict .
Fi@@ ft@@ y-@@ one percent of those surve@@ yed are against co@@ operating with the Syri@@ an rul@@ er B@@ ash@@ ar al-@@ Ass@@ ad , but 20 percent were in favour .
Tw@@ enty-@@ nine percent were un@@ decided .
Car@@ s : Second press day at the 6@@ 6th IA@@ A

After two press days , Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Autom@@ obile Exhibition , whose motto is &quot; Mo@@ bility Conn@@ ects &quot; , on Thursday .
The general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
The organis@@ ers from the automobile Association V@@ DA estimate that approximately 9@@ 00@@ ,000 visitors , similar to 2 years ago , will attend .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : out@@ break of violence on the Ser@@ bi@@ an-@@ Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used te@@ ar gas and water c@@ ann@@ ons against several hundred an@@ gr@@ y refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
He reported by telephone :
A group of refugees broke through the border .
A line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water c@@ ann@@ on stood at the ready .
Between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sti@@ cks and plastic bott@@ les at the officers .
At first the officers used a continuous spra@@ y of p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
Then the police used te@@ ar gas .
A lot of te@@ ar gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
This caused the group to break up .
The group has now reluc@@ t@@ antly withdrawn .
A pregn@@ ant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
Children who have inhal@@ ed te@@ ar gas are scre@@ aming .
Other refugees have sl@@ ump@@ ed down together and are suffering from resp@@ ir@@ atory dist@@ ress .
The press spo@@ kes@@ man for the Serbian police also sustained in@@ jur@@ ies from the use of te@@ ar gas and p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists poll@@ ed by R@@ eu@@ ters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
It &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Ang@@ el U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trilli@@ ons of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
However the Fed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy global outlook .
It has warned markets to be ready for a hi@@ ke but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
The decision is due to be announced at 20@@ .00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Delta State University sho@@ oter left note of ap@@ ology
After shooting and killing his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed Tuesday .
Police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ . said Lam@@ b , a ge@@ ography and social science education instruc@@ tor at Delta State University , called 9@@ 11 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
Lam@@ b told the dispat@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
He said &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to bo@@ ther anyone &quot; but is likely up@@ set .
Police asked the call@@ er his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
Lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
When police got to the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : &quot; I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only person who ever loved me .
After writing the note , Lam@@ b dro@@ ve 300 miles to Delta State where he killed E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as c@@ ops closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b &apos;s mind . &quot;
Despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b alle@@ ge@@ dly believed Pr@@ enti@@ ss was also roman@@ tically involved with Schmi@@ dt , authorities said Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love tri@@ angle . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
The two di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; dev@@ ast@@ ated . &quot;
He said Pr@@ enti@@ ss and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a ho@@ und dog named Ligh@@ tn@@ ing , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
&quot; She always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
Police said Lam@@ b had ph@@ oned relatives at some point Monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to j@@ ail . &quot;
When c@@ ops caught up with him on High@@ way 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lam@@ b pul@@ led his car over , b@@ ailed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
Lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .

Eur@@ ow@@ ings : Lufthansa re@@ construc@@ ting group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
The Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euros per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
Rec@@ on@@ struction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
Meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pil@@ ots &apos; union .
Lufthansa is re@@ organising the structure of its business and upgra@@ ding its low-@@ cost subsidiary Eur@@ ow@@ ings .
The goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
The Eur@@ ow@@ ings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
In the future , Karl Ul@@ rich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eur@@ ow@@ ings on the management board headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
With this new real@@ ign@@ ment Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eur@@ ow@@ ings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Eas@@ y@@ jet in the future .
Up to now the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been extremely complex .
The airline is consoli@@ dating the passenger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbr@@ ella .
New negotiations with pil@@ ots
Following the strike which was hal@@ ted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pil@@ ots &apos; union Cock@@ pit ( V@@ C ) in the pay dispute will be resumed on Thursday .
This was announced by the union .
Under discussion will be the pil@@ ots &apos; retirement scheme .
&quot; In a year with record results predic@@ ted &quot; Cock@@ pit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
The conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
Besides the pil@@ ots &apos; transitional pension payments , the background is the &quot; W@@ ings &quot; budget concept .
It proposes that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa out@@ sources to the group &apos;s own budget airline , Eur@@ ow@@ ings .

Manchester United &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w out for months with double fra@@ c@@ ture
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ c@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United &apos;s Champ@@ ions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
While this left the full-@@ back in t@@ ears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al remains hop@@ eful Sha@@ w could play again this season .
The injury was caused by a reck@@ less tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20-@@ year-old Sha@@ w had bur@@ st into the PS@@ V area .
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pit@@ ch and required oxy@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
Van Ga@@ al said : &quot; He has a double leg fra@@ c@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
It is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fantas@@ tically and then this happens .
When it was in the dres@@ sing room he had an oxy@@ gen mask on .
He was cr@@ ying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fra@@ c@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Mor@@ eno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the conc@@ ession of a spo@@ t-@@ k@@ ick .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ z@@ zo@@ li , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ alise the Mexican .
Van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
It was a very bad tackle with two legs .
A t@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account read : &quot; Thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . &quot;
Rel@@ ated : Manchester United suffer Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w blow in defeat at PS@@ V
The England def@@ ender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Phil@@ li@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; It &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
If any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an oppon@@ ent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the oppon@@ ent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ cu said .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the tackle on Lu@@ ke .
Spe@@ aking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
PS@@ V &apos;s Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
Sur@@ ely David Cam@@ eron knows The Lor@@ ax better than this ?
It &apos;s one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child lo@@ ves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless , it seems , you are David Cam@@ eron .
A@@ sk@@ ed by a provider of holiday child@@ care schemes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister op@@ ted for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
It was a difficult choice , Cam@@ eron writes in a message published on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , continuing : &quot; F@@ unny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
All very well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cam@@ eron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pré@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to p@@ ad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; Set in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need@@ -@@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chron@@ ic@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name The@@ od@@ or Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 .
If that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough , Cam@@ eron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ ax film provided on the Internet Mo@@ vie Dat@@ ab@@ ase website , which begins : &quot; In the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need@@ -@@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Au@@ dre@@ y . &quot;
Given he is an av@@ ow@@ edly hand@@ s-@@ on parent , it seems unlikely Cam@@ eron is so un@@ familiar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young un@@ named boy h@@ ears how the local environment was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the av@@ ar@@ icious , tre@@ e-@@ ch@@ opping , th@@ need@@ -@@ kn@@ itting On@@ ce-@@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at , mou@@ st@@ ach@@ io@@ ed creature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
Most likely , such a relatively low@@ ly PR task would have been out@@ sour@@ ced to an ai@@ de , seem@@ ingly one who has never read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
A Down@@ ing Street spo@@ kes@@ woman said the text was believed to have come from Cam@@ eron &apos;s constituency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cam@@ eron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England om@@ is@@ sion but it &apos;s still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates is a tough assign@@ ment but after seeing the squ@@ ad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-@@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
Ala@@ sta@@ ir C@@ ook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that bat@@ ting lin@@ eu@@ p and the collective min@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful posi@@ tivity .
With the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a sp@@ inner and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level , represents an att@@ acking option .
Rel@@ ated : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squ@@ ad and replaced by A@@ lex H@@ ales
The decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yor@@ k@@ shire .
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cri@@ ck@@ eters are judged on output .
There were no question marks over Jo@@ e R@@ oot , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ectors .
A couple of half-@@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own dest@@ iny .
Hop@@ efully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire another opportunity will come along .
The England head coach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss , pra@@ ised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
The question of how long a Test b@@ ats@@ man gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven cap@@ s - like S@@ am Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton got nine .
Only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
The only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jon@@ athan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that wast@@ ed opportunity is in the past now .
A@@ lex H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man I rate highly .
He is an X-@@ factor cri@@ ck@@ eter , which we at Yor@@ k@@ shire saw early this season when he made 23@@ 6 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge pit@@ ch that was doing a bit .
He must at least be affor@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the ma@@ ke-@@ up of the side in the U@@ A@@ E .
The idea of Mo@@ een opening the bat@@ ting alongside C@@ ook , which would get the extra sp@@ inner in while keeping four qu@@ ic@@ ks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don &apos;t see why a stro@@ k@@ em@@ aker cannot bat there and this left-@@ h@@ ander has already shown he is one hell of a cri@@ ck@@ eter .
Mo@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he has been a No@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
My old te@@ am-@@ m@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 Tests at first drop before step@@ ping up to open in 2001 .
He pe@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the squ@@ ad as back@@ -up sp@@ inner and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
People may look at his raw stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are not a he@@ ap of sp@@ inners putting their hands up and sel@@ ectors have op@@ ted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
A@@ way from the squ@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d addi@@ tions to their co@@ aching staff .
The appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the Sri Lanka b@@ ats@@ man , as a consult@@ ant for the Test matches could be a master@@ stro@@ ke .
He is one of the game &apos;s lo@@ vel@@ i@@ est blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ru@@ th@@ less stre@@ ak into the setup .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cri@@ cket , be it playing or co@@ aching , and like Mah@@ ela has nous that can be t@@ apped .
Sometimes new voices in the dres@@ sing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fres@@ hen up a side .
Col@@ ly &apos;s Dur@@ ham te@@ am-@@ m@@ ate Ben St@@ ok@@ es is res@@ ted for the one-@@ da@@ yers , R@@ oot was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
While not everyone will agree , the co@@ aches and sel@@ ectors do not set the schedule .
And you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .

David Cam@@ eron &apos;s half-@@ bak@@ ed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial Jer@@ em@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
For@@ eign@@ ers have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages too .
A European diplom@@ at ch@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in ass@@ or@@ ted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain &apos;s self-@@ absor@@ bed agenda of di@@ visi@@ ve concessions and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
In Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual bean , the TU@@ C decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they ero@@ ded social protection .
We could even call it Da@@ ve and George &apos;s sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
PM and chan@@ cell@@ or rock up to summ@@ its or bilateral sessions in foreign capit@@ als , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It &apos;s all about me .
My European pal , who wants an out@@ war@@ d-@@ looking Britain inside the EU t@@ ent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - suggests that more short-@@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capit@@ als have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany &apos;s cau@@ ti@@ ously le@@ vel-@@ headed chan@@ cell@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Franç@@ ois Holl@@ ande is facing re-@@ election or replacement in 20@@ 17 .
He is a f@@ ading force too .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
It &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies .
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately un@@ helpful remarks , S@@ N@@ P-@@ style , during the UK &apos;s 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my pal suggests .
&quot; The ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a fix &quot; and &quot; Britain got nothing of value out of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
The Europeans know to their cost how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be and how EU-@@ scep@@ tic the oli@@ gar@@ ch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony B@@ enn@@ -@@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They may di@@ mly remember Bor@@ is John@@ son , the arch Euro-@@ opport@@ un@@ ist , making his name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 9@@ 0s .
For all his foo@@ lish@@ ness E@@ d Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
They included the med@@ ley of tax@@ -@@ sh@@ y ras@@ c@@ als , ph@@ one-@@ h@@ acking foreigners and p@@ seu@@ do non-@@ d@@ oms who own most of our great newspapers .
Ac@@ tually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a rand@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ anas to di@@ stra@@ ct it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
In fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cam@@ eron &apos;s referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conc@@ eded the principle over the EU &apos;s abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get@@ -@@ out card .
The press never for@@ gave him that either .
But nice Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at West@@ min@@ ster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ adopting N@@ eil Kinnock &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 8@@ 0s , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ dly call evol@@ ving .
He says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s wo@@ ad-@@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der shores of T@@ ory little En@@ gl@@ ander@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
It &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A B@@ enn , but not a B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; B@@ enn said on radio and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him stru@@ gg@@ led not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of ab@@ ra@@ sive John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 7@@ 0s , when his old dad stru@@ gg@@ led on TV to be dis@@ loy@@ al to Labour cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
But fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn &apos;s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MP@@ s at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
Whatever the bot@@ tom@@ -up , tou@@ ch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the ma@@ el@@ strom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
It &apos;s fair enough not to give Cam@@ eron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell has said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
But Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic equi@@ vocation about EU membership - consistent with their B@@ enn@@ ite si@@ ege economy , anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among le@@ f@@ tw@@ ing dis@@ si@@ dents for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central ten@@ et of doctr@@ inal squ@@ ab@@ bles .
As with his equi@@ vocation over Nat@@ o - Tom Watson is ad@@ am@@ ant that J@@ C won &apos;t campaign to qu@@ it - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have susp@@ icious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be point@@ less ?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its &quot; fe@@ eb@@ le military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-@@ cutting T@@ ory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
Exper@@ ts critic@@ ise Public Health England e-@@ cigar@@ ettes review
C@@ laim@@ s by a govern@@ ment-@@ funded agency that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking aro@@ se from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
Exper@@ ts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the L@@ anc@@ et in critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in its report on e-@@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; land@@ mark &quot; report last month , descri@@ bing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
But several researchers have ques@@ tioned the robu@@ st@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An edi@@ torial in the L@@ anc@@ et medical journ@@ al last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily f@@ lim@@ sy foundation &quot; on which PH@@ E based its main conclusion .
Writ@@ ing in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have ques@@ tioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European public health at the London School of Hygi@@ ene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medic@@ ine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : &quot; A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
They said the public would expect PH@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling .
In fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi-@@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) model to syn@@ thes@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different ni@@ cot@@ in@@ e-@@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said one spons@@ or of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco for an independent study .
He also endorsed B@@ AT &apos;s public health cre@@ denti@@ als in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-@@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris International , they added .
The r@@ ationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-@@ cigar@@ ette champ@@ ions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PH@@ E .
The research paper produced by the group &quot; t@@ ell@@ ingly conc@@ edes &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
However , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said PH@@ E &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-@@ smo@@ kers &quot; were pre@@ mature .
Pro@@ f Kev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well@@ being at PH@@ E , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
He said : &quot; E-@@ cigar@@ ettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
One in two lifelong smo@@ kers dies from their ad@@ diction .
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
N@@ early 80@@ ,000 people a year die of a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ related illness and smoking costs the N@@ HS £ 2@@ b@@ n a year .
By sp@@ elling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are not ris@@ k-@@ free , they carry only a fra@@ ction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national re@@ mit .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Lu@@ ke John@@ son has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying its commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ ap .
John@@ son said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be wat@@ ched by a smaller audience in tough sl@@ ots against its ri@@ vals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
After the BBC &apos;s director general , Tony Hall , said the cor@@ poration wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , John@@ son said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a ti@@ e-@@ up with the BBC without success .
&quot; I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commission@@ s and broad@@ casts programmes that would clearly be shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; John@@ son told the House of L@@ ords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you keep the licence fee , which I &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren &apos;t making and commission@@ ing .
They broadcast The Vo@@ ice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
The idea that no one else would show that is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us , it &apos;s obviously non@@ sense .
John@@ son said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsi@@ dy .
The Vo@@ ice is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly made in-house .
Frank@@ ly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
I don &apos;t think that would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
John@@ son , a serial entreprene@@ ur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ asing ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . &quot;
His comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lec@@ ture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
John@@ son said the BBC &apos;s more ni@@ che public service programmes &quot; go on to BB@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their re@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ tim@@ oni@@ ous missions about justi@@ fying £ 4@@ b@@ n in licence fee income , &quot; Well of course , we do all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one wat@@ ched . &quot;
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
On the licence fee , John@@ son told the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
Of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don &apos;t consu@@ me a lot of the BBC .
For@@ mer Sky and Channel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should re@@ vise its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
He said little of the BBC &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.@@ 1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada and change it to &quot; inform , en@@ ligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
On the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a hand@@ ful were shown on TV , and enter into alli@@ ances with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make them all available to watch online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses .
Scienti@@ sts have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with genetically modified ner@@ vous systems that can be controlled by bur@@ sts of sound waves .
The tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with son@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high-@@ pit@@ ched for humans to hear .
The pul@@ ses work by switching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry mem@@ bran@@ e channels that respond to ul@@ tr@@ asonic waves .
Rel@@ ated : Res@@ ear@@ chers read and write brain activity with light
Res@@ ear@@ chers said the wor@@ ms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , du@@ b@@ bed son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and mus@@ cle cells from outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , a resear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Gu@@ ardi@@ an that the procedure could one day replace deep@@ -@@ brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asi@@ ve procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people &apos;s bra@@ ins to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
N@@ em@@ at@@ ode wor@@ ms do not usually react to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a flu@@ id containing micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
The bub@@ bles , he found , ampli@@ fy the ul@@ tr@@ asonic waves which then pass inside the wor@@ ms .
The ampli@@ fied ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves act on structures called TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels , found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms &quot; cells .
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
To make ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und@@ -@@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their motor neur@@ ons carried TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels .
When he applied ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und to the modified creatures , the sound waves were ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmitted into the wor@@ ms , where they swit@@ ched on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
The procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
But Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over that technique .
Unlike light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ bre to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves can pass through tissue un@@ hin@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ull .
&quot; We believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neur@@ ological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
Other applications could focus on mus@@ cle cells and ins@@ ul@@ in-@@ producing cells , he added .

Ei@@ ght golden rules for living in student halls
It &apos;s been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an obli@@ vious 19@@ -@@ year-old , still believ@@ ing in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but it &apos;s only now I recall the stra@@ ined sm@@ iles of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed into eight simple rules .
Mo@@ ving into halls can range from mil@@ dly ner@@ ve-@@ ra@@ cking to totally ter@@ rif@@ ying .
It &apos;s temp@@ ting to bab@@ ble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly neither love nor h@@ ate Mar@@ m@@ ite because seriously guys it &apos;s just ye@@ ast extract HA@@ HA@@ H@@ A I &apos;ll be in my room . &quot;
Take a bre@@ ath .
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
It ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to sc@@ out out the people you like ver@@ sus those you w@@ ouldn &apos;t talk to even if your ey@@ el@@ ash@@ es were on fire and they were disp@@ ens@@ ing ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers .
Gi@@ ve people space .
People &apos;s rooms often mor@@ ph into drinks recep@@ tions , mo@@ vi@@ e-@@ night venues and commun@@ al hang@@ out spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dres@@ sed and adjust their under@@ wear .
Rel@@ ated : Don &apos;t even think about starting university in a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
Your room should be a retreat , yet many halls form an inter-@@ ro@@ om@@ -@@ st@@ rolling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to lifelong friend@@ ships .
That can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to re@@ charge .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I &apos;ve exp@@ ended on inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhau@@ sted from soci@@ alising - and maybe text instead of kno@@ cking .
Spe@@ aking of kno@@ cking : do it .
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn &apos;t locked he was invited in .
He saw some things .
Make friends through b@@ aking .
Since you &apos;re starting un@@ i at the height of Bak@@ e-@@ O@@ ff man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es seems margin@@ ally less wei@@ rd , less 1950@@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I bak@@ ed you something , now s@@ mile as I ask you personal questions . &quot;
Off@@ ering hom@@ em@@ ade tre@@ ats is a great way to make friends .
Your hous@@ em@@ ates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associ@@ ating your face with a tasty surprise .
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent b@@ aker .
Po@@ or@@ ly-@@ f@@ used l@@ umps of flo@@ ur , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pre@@ tend to be as@@ le@@ ep when you kno@@ ck .
Ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student halls .
Obviously ni@@ cking some@@ ones ch@@ icken is th@@ eft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea ste@@ aling ?
Double check with the milk owner .
Ch@@ ances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re se@@ e@@ thing inside .
If someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying and you have my sympath@@ ies - but try to deal with it more mat@@ ur@@ ely than my hall@@ m@@ ate , who tain@@ ted her milk with wash@@ ing-up liquid to pun@@ ish those who st@@ ole it .
She &apos;s in j@@ ail now .
You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
This isn &apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al people in glass houses .
A girl on my corrid@@ or asked her neigh@@ bour if they w@@ ouldn &apos;t mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3@@ am and she had an ex@@ am in the morning .
They responded by turning it up .
When they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kin@@ dly let them sleep for two hours before b@@ lasting her own music , lo@@ cking her door as she left for her three-@@ hour ex@@ am .
W@@ ouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?
Conver@@ sely , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le-@@ bit@@ ingly aw@@ k@@ ward if you mist@@ ook a hall@@ m@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouse , h@@ oo@@ ked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get cust@@ ody of all your mutual friends ?
Of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hall@@ m@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
In the exhi@@ lar@@ ating moment you realise someone &apos;s left their keys inside their un@@ locked room , the line between p@@ ranking and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
A good p@@ rank is f@@ unny , but takes moments to reverse .
T@@ each a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security by hi@@ ding something - but never tr@@ ash someone &apos;s room with t@@ oo@@ th@@ pa@@ ste and sham@@ po@@ o .
Lo@@ ck their door and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the free@@ zer - but don &apos;t Blu@@ -T@@ ack their pos@@ sessions to the ceiling more than twice .
Ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low ear@@ ners
Property entreprene@@ ur Markus Gil@@ dner is building ter@@ ra@@ ced houses in the Middle Fran@@ con@@ ian town of Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
For example for refugees – but also as a sign : &quot; Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . &quot;
&quot; I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays , &quot; says the 4@@ 4-@@ year-old in an interview .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
Ent@@ rep@@ rene@@ ur Mar@@ cus Gil@@ dner believes he knows how quickly economical housing can be developed : with this project he is building ter@@ ra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
What solution are you offering ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : M@@ ass accommodation in containers and gy@@ ms is not sustainable .
Because most of the people will be staying here .
We will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influ@@ x of refugees over the next decades .
A totally standard three-@@ stor@@ ey ter@@ ra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : A ter@@ ra@@ ced house needs little space .
It facilit@@ ates integration .
It is different when the people are hous@@ ed in blocks of flat@@ s .
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three living units each for four asylum seekers .
Each living unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , one kitchen and a lounge .
It &apos;s possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I &apos;m going back .
Then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
What are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : The price for 160 m ² of living space per house amounts to € 18@@ 4@@ ,000 without land .
That is man@@ age@@ able .
Con@@ struction took six months .
That is reasonable .
Did building regulations complic@@ ate your plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
The s@@ word of Dam@@ oc@@ les threatening special building projects , and parking space regulations , always make it complicated .
Sc@@ ary .
It is still assumed that anyone creating three flat@@ s in a ter@@ ra@@ ced house needs at least three parking places .
Exc@@ ept that there is not enough space in towns .
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
How have residents re@@ acted to your ter@@ ra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : There were some who accused me of building luxury accommodation for asylum seekers .
That is definitely not true .
But aren &apos;t you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gil@@ dner : The truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommodation that has been built , which hardly anybody can afford any longer .
My project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
Not only refugees need accommodation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demonstrating how it is still possible to build economically and well nowadays .
This is what it is about .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Sett@@ ings app , t@@ apping &quot; General , &quot; and then selecting &quot; Software Update . &quot;
If it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
Some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that &quot; Software update failed . &quot;
To get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the r@@ ush to die down , or to try and upgrade through i@@ Tunes .
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
That might include del@@ eting app@@ s to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by s@@ lim@@ ming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest app@@ s to delete and then re-@@ install them once the process is over .
It &apos;s worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the update happens , so that it doesn &apos;t run out of battery .
If the charge is too low , Apple won &apos;t let the update go ahead , since the phone dying hal@@ f@@ way through could lead to the update breaking .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in his fight for the Formul@@ a One world champ@@ ionship title against his clearly leading Merc@@ edes te@@ amm@@ ate Le@@ wis Ham@@ il@@ ton : &quot; Full attack &quot; .
The world champ@@ ionship run@@ n@@ er-@@ up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races &quot; that I &apos;ve got nothing more to lose &quot; .
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday , 53 points divide the vice world champion from the tit@@ leh@@ older and two times champion Ham@@ il@@ ton .
The Bri@@ t has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floo@@ d@@ lit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite .
In 2009 and in the preced@@ ing year the 30-@@ year-old Bri@@ t was able to win the race .
Whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet unclear .
A p@@ all of smo@@ g has been hang@@ ing over the city for days , caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ at@@ ra .
Bad Kis@@ singer ch@@ ess club has a prominent member
The &quot; Ch@@ ess friends of Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen &quot; ch@@ ess club , founded three months ago , has admitted another member to its ranks , taking the number of members to 19 players .
The new member is business@@ man Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passion@@ ate ch@@ ess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen more than 40 times for spa treatments .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and is a fre@@ em@@ an of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ bec@@ ke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the ch@@ ess club in Bad K@@ iss@@ ingen with a donation which was accepted by chairman Al@@ fred Kl@@ ein .
This makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
Youth work and talent se@@ arches can also be pursued .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants his membership of the ch@@ ess club as well as his friendly contact with the &quot; Red@@ -@@ white &quot; tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the spa town .
Ac@@ comm@@ odation office seeks fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face contact
S@@ alu@@ dis and the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft retirement centre have group@@ ed together under the mant@@ le of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Gra@@ f-@@ St@@ auff@@ en@@ ber@@ g-@@ Platz .
In addition to obtaining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there .
The social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre .
More precisely , to Gra@@ f-@@ St@@ auff@@ en@@ ber@@ g-@@ Platz .
A new accommodation office will be opening there shortly .
Here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nur@@ sing insurance or the services of nur@@ sing and health insurance companies .
With our out@@ patient care service we have for years realised that family car@@ egi@@ vers are often left alone .
This raises numerous questions .
&quot; Not in@@ frequently , too , many services provided by ins@@ ur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , &quot; the new manager , J@@ ut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people &apos;s welfare is also responsible for the Ant@@ on@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; out@@ patient services , explained .
Apart from advice , the new accommodation office also offers courses in prevention , health and wellness .
S@@ alu@@ dis has been taken on board for this .
As a result , additional offer@@ ings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapy treatment are also available .
The offers from the senior citizens centre and from S@@ alu@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
S@@ alu@@ dis represents prevention , precau@@ tion , and rehabilitation .
&quot; The senior citizens &apos; centre for care and nur@@ sing , &quot; is how Hei@@ ke Ri@@ ed@@ el , managing director of S@@ alu@@ dis describes it .
Both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommodation office in the town centre as democratic change ,
as this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of B@@ am@@ berg essential in the future .
Furthermore , as Mayor Wolfgang M@@ etz@@ ner ( SP@@ D ) under@@ lined at the opening ceremony , the accommodation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . &quot; There are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend inv@@ itations to regular social gather@@ ings &quot; .
Thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .
The accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

It &apos;s something special for our team to be playing against a third leag@@ ue team .
We are hoping to get a large number of spec@@ t@@ ators , and not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ lit games have a special appeal .

Vi@@ enn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang dies at the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 , according to the Künstler@@ haus on Tuesday .
In Men@@ g the Künstler@@ haus has lost an hon@@ our@@ ary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; it is reported .
Born in Vienna in 19@@ 22 , Men@@ g studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich L@@ ehm@@ ann during and after the second World War .
He worked from 195@@ 2 as a fre@@ el@@ ance architect , but was also a teacher , writer and institute director .
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design .
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treas@@ ury chamber in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ wi@@ tz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

He was once a foot@@ b@@ aller but now T@@ im Wi@@ ese , ex-@@ national go@@ al@@ ie for Germany who also played for Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , is a w@@ rest@@ ler .
According to him he wanted to put on 30 kg of mus@@ cle mass in the past two years .
On the other hand he has@@ n &apos;t put on any intellectual weight .
Wi@@ ese was just having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when outside he saw a traffic war@@ den putting a penalty notice on his white Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .

The accus@@ ation has been confirmed by the town of Bremen but it is not yet known what the consequences of this extraordinary incident will be .
&quot; The matter is still being investigated , &quot; says a spo@@ kes@@ person for the town of Bremen .
Only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wi@@ ese .

Men set upon 17@@ -@@ year-old Af@@ gan
Police are seeking witn@@ esses to an incident in Bad So@@ den@@ -S@@ al@@ mün@@ ster . At about 11.@@ 45 on Friday evening , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
According to police one of the group , a 17@@ -@@ year-old Afghan , was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
At this point the group were level with the b@@ ft pet@@ rol station .
Three people were standing on the pet@@ rol station premises .
One of these men sh@@ ou@@ ted at the youth and hit him in the face with his f@@ ist .
This broke the victim &apos;s nose and his nose b@@ led heavily .
One of his two friends ran to him and beg@@ ged the attack@@ er to let the victim go .
The injured young man was taken home by his friends .
The perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group to their home in a car and dro@@ ve past it several times in an ost@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous manner .
As soon as they could no longer see the car , the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
There he was attacked again by his original attack@@ er and another male .
Using a club , they beat the victim in the face and upper leg .
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
Up to now there is only a vague description of the perpet@@ r@@ ators .
One was a man of about 5@@ ft 11@@ in t@@ all .
The second attack@@ er was about 5@@ ft 5@@ in t@@ all and was dres@@ sed in je@@ ans and a brown and white shirt .
Police are asking any possible witn@@ esses to contact them by telephone on 00@@ 49 6@@ 18@@ 1 100 12@@ 3 .
Dr Frank Müller takes over Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10,000
Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over practice from Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen .
The may@@ or of the joint community , Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann , business spons@@ or U@@ ta Sei@@ m-@@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endorf &apos;s may@@ or Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are delighted at this turn of events .
Many areas in the country have no doctor – As@@ endorf by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October Dr Frank Müller is taking over the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice .
While Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen is reti@@ ring , her husband Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich will spend the next few months working part-@@ time with his successor .
Dr Müller re@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
When the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr Sil@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who at the time were finishing their resi@@ dencies in Ver@@ den hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
&quot; It was always in the back of our minds that the Müll@@ ers would fit into this practice well , &quot; says Dr Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen and lau@@ ghs .
&quot; When we were ready , I simply called them up . &quot;
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; The proximity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , &quot; says 3@@ 9-@@ year-old Müller .
&quot; We want to get to know the families and support them over the years . &quot;
He also sees being his own bo@@ ss as a benefit .
And so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers would buy the house with the practice .
However in the meantime they are living in Bru@@ ch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
Father of two Frank Müller also grew up there and after his medical studies in Han@@ over he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg und Rot@@ enburg .
He is currently working as a consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ingen , furthermore he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the county of Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood donation service in Bru@@ ch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
From 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new bo@@ ss .
While sur@@ ge@@ on Dr Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen worked as a general practi@@ tion@@ er , his wife Ur@@ sel ( a specialist in internal medicine ) specialised in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
The Müll@@ ers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general practi@@ tion@@ ers .
&quot; So it &apos;s out with the end@@ osc@@ op@@ y , &quot; says 3@@ 8-@@ year-old Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long-term and stress EK@@ G@@ s and we need one more consulting room .
The IT system will also be completely renewed .
The Müll@@ ers are receiving a grant tot@@ alling € 50@@ ,000 as part of a funding programme from the county ( € 2,@@ 500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 12@@ ,@@ 500 ) and the local authority ( € 12@@ ,@@ 500 ) .
&quot; This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , &quot; stressed the may@@ or of the joint community Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann .
According to Sy@@ l@@ via Müll@@ er-@@ G@@ ong@@ oll , some 2@@ ,000 patients visit the Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
There is another GP practice in As@@ endorf .
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen , the chem@@ ist will stay in As@@ endorf .
If they ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t found any successor , it would have closed down .
Anyone visiting the Müll@@ ers &apos; surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assist@@ ants and the clean@@ er from the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens .
With their leaving , an era ends in As@@ endorf ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
&quot; We started with only two rooms , &quot; rem@@ embers Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ au@@ sen with a gr@@ in .
After such a long time she feels a little wi@@ st@@ ful .
&quot; But we &apos;ll still be living in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and I &apos;m sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , &quot; says the internal medicine specialist .
Her husband adds with a s@@ mile , &quot; We &apos;ve got a 6@@ 000 m ² garden . &quot;
&quot; Up to now I haven &apos;t done much gar@@ dening , that might change now . &quot;
The couple also have two grand@@ children and enjoy travelling .
Croatia : &quot; We are letting the refugees through &quot;
&quot; B@@ order control is being brought in now on our southern border too , &quot; says Inter@@ ior Minister Johann@@ a Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner .
In parallel , checks on the Hungarian border remain in place .
It is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can &quot; of course &quot; do so .
The care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
It is equally clear &quot; that obvious signals are needed , &quot; says the minister .
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration , and not over the Austri@@ an@@ -S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ian border either .
A controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a &quot; corrid@@ or &quot; - Slovenia has refused .
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish corrid@@ ors for the refugees .
However , Inter@@ ior Minister V@@ es@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach did not see it in quite the same light .
The idea of corrid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slov@@ ein@@ a intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary .
The border with Croatia , as the external border to the Schengen area , is however already heavily controlled .
But as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not suggest@@ ing se@@ aling its borders for refugees .
&quot; Every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
According to the Croatian government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the To@@ var@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing , in order to avoid registration .
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize field .
Since then , according to local media , police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian T@@ av@@ ar@@ nik .
They are mostly Syri@@ an and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
The emergency se@@ vi@@ ces and the Red Cross are also already in place .
Inter@@ ior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days .
In addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ oni@@ an-@@ Serbian border , which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border , are being diver@@ ted to Croatia
The government in Bel@@ grade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . &quot; We neither can nor want to do that , &quot; they stated .
According to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
Over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The det@@ ain@@ ees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Maced@@ onian border , about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; We heard that Hungary is closed , so the police said we should come here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
They wanted to go through Croatia , Slowen@@ ia and Austria to get to Germany .
This implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey , Greece , Macedonia , Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predic@@ ted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : &quot; Wi@@ des@@ pread options for border control &quot;
Croatian Inter@@ ior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influ@@ x of refugees .
He gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non-@@ member of the Schengen Treaty , has &quot; widespread options for border control . &quot;
R@@ ig@@ or@@ ous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ egen area .
Slovenia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
There are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border f@@ ence .
According to media reports from Bel@@ grade , they spent the past night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
The Hungarian authorities claim that both the Hor@@ gos and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cross@@ ings also remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear .
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Inter@@ ior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovi@@ c , tried to re@@ assure people : he considers the debate on the refugees &apos; alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be pre@@ mature .
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
But private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still un@@ clear@@ ed min@@ e@@ fields .
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ es@@ we@@ ep@@ ers has been sent to the border region .
Stock exchange h@@ ack@@ er : Ukra@@ ini@@ ans pay $ 30 million

E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care celeb@@ rates 20 years in Mannheim
Business rules around the Par@@ ade@@ platz in Mannheim
People carry out their err@@ ands , some of them walking br@@ is@@ k@@ ly , some of them st@@ rolling along in a lei@@ surely fashion .
They head for the two branches of the Mannheim car show@@ room .
Tr@@ ams stop .
Pul@@ sing , vibrant life in the brilliant autumn sunshine , and right in the middle are four big black@@ boards each bearing the words , &quot; Before I die I want to … &quot;
The E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary , and is encounter@@ ing extremely mixed reactions .
&quot; It &apos;s about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine L@@ ammer .
The head of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by , as are voluntary workers .
While many p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by impul@@ sively gr@@ ab the chal@@ k and complete the sentence with &quot; affir@@ m my life &quot; , &quot; be able to read &quot; , &quot; drive through the USA in a camp@@ er van &quot; , &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for long &quot; , others stop briefly , read , say things like &quot; I &apos;m not ready for that yet &quot; , and carry on .
Again and again little discussions develop in cor@@ ners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also there now .
&quot; It &apos;s only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live respon@@ sibly , &quot; says the Director of the Protest@@ ant social char@@ ity Di@@ ak@@ onischen Werk in Mannheim , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ it@@ as Association for E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care .
Which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20-@@ year-old organisation .
Of course it &apos;s understandable that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the black@@ boards ; in the end it &apos;s a very personal matter .
The topics of life and death are still ste@@ ep@@ ed in tab@@ oos , according to Jose@@ fine L@@ ammer &apos;s experience , although the hosp@@ ice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .
A perception shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
The volunte@@ er worker , who helps people to deal with death and gri@@ ef , has been with the organisation from the start .
Having been confronted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
When the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice Care organisation appe@@ aled for volunte@@ er help@@ ers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunte@@ ers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the San@@ kt Vinc@@ ent Hosp@@ ice .
They are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id is particularly well suited to handling this job and the experiences and everything it entails .
&quot; I see life from a different point of view , I believe it is precious and I sei@@ ze the moment , &quot; she says .
The out@@ patient services offered by the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice organisation are free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ation@@ ally independent .
Financial support from health insurance companies and donations by members enable education as well as training sessions , and training and supervision for p@@ alli@@ ative care providers and gri@@ ef coun@@ s@@ ell@@ ors .
Training for new staff is offered every two years .
The black@@ boards , with the messages written on them on Saturday , are now on display in the Evangel@@ ical church ( M@@ 1 , 1@@ a ) and the Catholic church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
Anyone who wants to can also write their own personal wishes on post@@ cards there .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x earnings mixed , lo@@ wers fiscal 20@@ 16 outlook
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-@@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
The company also said it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
At this time last year , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x announced it would hire 50@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday &apos;s opening bel@@ l .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 c@@ ents from an earlier predic@@ tion .
An@@ alyst@@ s expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hi@@ kes aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect Jan@@ . 4 , and higher sur@@ charges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in November .
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-@@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was &quot; performing soli@@ dly given weak@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
The holi@@ da@@ y-@@ hi@@ ring plans were announced a day after ri@@ val UPS said that that it plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same that it hi@@ red last year .
In the quarter that ended Aug@@ . 31 , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .

R@@ even@@ ue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
Six an@@ alyst@@ s surve@@ yed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stag@@ n@@ ate .
But the boom in online shopping has boo@@ sted results at F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Gro@@ und .
In the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-@@ insurance .
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
In pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bel@@ l , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
At their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 2@@ 7-@@ foot Hon@@ dur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Lo@@ oming over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s orn@@ ate , two-@@ story bo@@ ard@@ room will be a m@@ ural of the United States .
The map is a remin@@ der that Fed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
But since the Great Rec@@ ession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
And that third mandate could be the X-@@ factor in a t@@ oo-@@ clo@@ se@@ -to-@@ predic@@ t decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being we@@ an@@ ed from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near@@ -@@ zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
Even though most data show the economy growing soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets could make al@@ read@@ y-@@ cau@@ tious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ tish about adding to the vol@@ atility by raising their bench@@ mark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nic@@ ol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market@@ place is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &quot; she said .
There &apos;s no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
About half of economists surve@@ yed recently by Blo@@ om@@ berg predic@@ ted a rate increase this week .
Financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
On Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones industrial average j@@ ump@@ ed 2@@ 28@@ .@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
The r@@ ally was trig@@ gered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
&quot; It would be a surprise if the Fed hi@@ ked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
If Fed policymakers did , &quot; they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t pan@@ ic . &quot;
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed .
Although job creation slow@@ ed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
W@@ age gains have shown signs of pic@@ king up .
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharp@@ ly lower oil prices .
The economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , &quot; said I@@ an Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ economics .
But financial markets around the world started conv@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
The D@@ ow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors fear@@ ed a s@@ lowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
The market has re@@ bound@@ ed somewhat this month , with the D@@ ow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
For Fed policymakers , the market tur@@ mo@@ il adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; Ab@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tigh@@ tening at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the UC@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official .
Now , he predic@@ ts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the imp@@ acts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-@@ dates the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
The health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the Fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be fac@@ tor@@ ed into its decision-making .
But , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
The central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
The mere hin@@ t by th@@ en-@@ Chairman Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the Fed might &quot; t@@ aper &quot; its monetary expansion trig@@ gered market conv@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central ban@@ kers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
Its decision-making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for weal@@ th-@@ management firm En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
J@@ eff@@ rey L@@ ack@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , V@@ a . , noted this month that &quot; the Fed has a history of over@@ re@@ acting to financial market movements that seem un@@ connected to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ ack@@ er , a voting member of the policy@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , c@@ ited decisions in 199@@ 8-@@ 99 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its bench@@ mark rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identi@@ fiable implications for U.S. growth , &quot; L@@ ack@@ er said .
A year later , Fed officials re@@ vers@@ ed those cuts .
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market mel@@ t@@ down , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s rat@@ e-@@ setting committee .
The latest tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; You certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being scar@@ ed of a rate hi@@ ke because markets got up@@ set , &quot; said Po@@ sen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the cur@@ ve .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a bit of help for refugees
These days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
To prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary help@@ ers .
In Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is also a whole range of people who un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly support asylum seekers in the town .
Among these are Pet@@ ra und Klaus H@@ eine .
Pet@@ ra H@@ eine is a dedicated teacher .
Even at 74 she still lo@@ ves teaching .
Every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
There she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s P@@ edi@@ atri@@ c Society of Rio Grande Pro@@ mot@@ es He@@ al@@ thy Bre@@ ast@@ feeding Di@@ ets
Brazilian pedi@@ atri@@ c organization SP@@ RS has come up with a sho@@ cking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while bre@@ ast@@ feeding , by featuring images of bab@@ ies su@@ ck@@ ling from bre@@ asts painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of prot@@ eins , f@@ ats , vit@@ am@@ ins , and car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates , which give bab@@ ies all the nutri@@ ents they need to grow a strong immune system .
Due to excess energy requirements , pregn@@ ant women and new m@@ oms are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie in@@ take by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
However , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ orie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment mothers should make .
A recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medic@@ ine in Texas revealed that healthy di@@ ets of pregn@@ ant women actually affected the genetic expression of their bab@@ ies and protected them from developing tum@@ ors .
Unfortunately , un@@ healthy di@@ ets were found to neg@@ atively affect the child &apos;s immune system .
Exc@@ ep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
Bern@@ ried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.@@ 3 million sports hall .
And it is making an exception .
The roof may be f@@ latter to accommodate a solar energy system .
Pl@@ anning for the long-@@ awa@@ ited sports building on the Bern@@ ried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
The committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an &quot; exception &quot; , or rather an &quot; exemption &quot; under building law to the applicable building plan .
The &quot; exception &quot; refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure .
According to this a &quot; g@@ able roof with an off-@@ centre ri@@ dge and roof over@@ hang &quot; will be constructed .
The background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels . &quot; This means we will have a wonder@@ fully large south-@@ facing roof , &quot; explained may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
The &quot; exemption &quot; on the other hand refers to the roof pit@@ ch , which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipul@@ ations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
This will reduce the volume of the hall .
Therefore an &quot; exemption &quot; is necessary , since the development plan allows no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to roof pit@@ ch - while the Bern@@ ried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemp@@ tions .
The sports hall is however more of a recur@@ ring project . &quot; We are not setting a precedent with this , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bern@@ ried .
Co@@ sts have been calculated at around € 2.@@ 3 million .
Con@@ tri@@ butions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
In the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 met@@ re hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
P@@ ei@@ s@@ sen@@ berg Clin@@ ic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
The P@@ ei@@ s@@ sen@@ berg Hospital is closing earlier than planned – in 20@@ 16 .
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
The wards and the majority of employees are moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au from P@@ ei@@ s@@ sen@@ berg .
This allows for the district &apos;s limited company hospital &apos;s surprising plans , confirms district administrator Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss .
The Board of Directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
If these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ s@@ sen@@ berg will remain in employment .
The vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
The premises are available .
Those employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered positions in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss .
Emp@@ lo@@ yees have been informed about the plans .
The changes were trig@@ gered by the resign@@ ation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clin@@ ic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
When the question of who his successor should be , according to Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; , who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au , was raised .
For the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital , these changes mean an &quot; upgrade &quot; and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss .
Fis@@ her is a specialist in car@@ di@@ ac pac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological dis@@ orders in its internal medicine department .
In the transi@@ tionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both establishments , and in the next year the former min@@ ers &apos; hospital in P@@ ei@@ s@@ sen@@ berg , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
Thus far the district has planned this for 20@@ 18 , when the currently ongoing restoration of the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is finished .
District administrator Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contradi@@ cts ru@@ mo@@ urs that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Min@@ ers , will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I can rule that out . &quot; What will happen to the building , Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ss cannot say ; that needs more consideration .
At the moment a Car@@ it@@ as short-term care facility and a day@@ time psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c facility are hous@@ ed there .
&quot; It &apos;s the best thing that could have happened for us ; we won &apos;t get this sort of opportunity again , &quot; says Fischer about the move to the Le@@ ch , which has been accepted &quot; positively and with understanding &quot; by employees .
Real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physi@@ cian do not really exist .
He was asked by his colleagues at Sch@@ ong@@ au to take over the post of medical director .
The Pi@@ ess@@ enberg hospital , which once had 100 beds , has been constantly under threat of closure over the last decades . De@@ partments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ etri@@ cs .
The hand@@ ball@@ ers of Rhein@@ -@@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lö@@ wen are being challeng@@ ed this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ischer H@@ C .
The leaders of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a are the clear favour@@ ites in W@@ up@@ per@@ tal , however there are no grounds for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
In the past season the B@@ aden team suffered a painful defeat at B@@ H@@ C and they have some ground to make up there .
Two injured in hunting accident near P@@ rat@@ au
Two trac@@ tor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the ma@@ ize harv@@ est on Tuesday after@@ no@@ oon .
A number of h@@ un@@ ts@@ men were in action on a cor@@ n field near P@@ rat@@ au ( W@@ itt@@ enburg district ) during the harv@@ est , according to police .
After shots were fi@@ red , two men , one 63 and the other 22 , suffered severe in@@ jur@@ ies and were taken to hospital .
The precise cause of the accident was initially unclear .
Criminal investig@@ ators are trying to determine the details .
Miss@@ ing 16-@@ year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine the victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-@@ year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine who has been missing since Saturday .
When ques@@ tioned the 20-@@ year-old admitted to having killed the teen@@ ager and thrown her body into a can@@ al in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
Six@@ te@@ en-@@ year-old missing from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
The body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen near Kais@@ er@@ slau@@ tern the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police reported on Wednesday .
A 20-@@ year-old suspect , who conf@@ essed to the crime and led investig@@ ators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
The 16-@@ year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autumn party in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
In their search for the young woman , investig@@ ators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
Inter@@ views with the missing girl &apos;s circle of friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances ultimately resulted in 20-@@ year-old becoming a suspect .
The presum@@ ed perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a can@@ al in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen , where the body was found .
Under inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation the arrested man conf@@ essed the police that he had killed the 16-@@ year-old and thrown her body in the can@@ al .
The 20-@@ year-old will be brought before the ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate on Wednesday ; investig@@ ators have reduced the charge to one of man@@ slau@@ ghter .
Further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
Pres@@ sure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The struggle for al@@ locations in the German housing market began long ago .
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU , more and more people are crow@@ ding into a market which in many large towns is already over@@ bur@@ dened .
They are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
To supply the demand for affordable homes , 400@@ ,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
This is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the &quot; Social H@@ ous@@ ing &quot; federation of associations .
In comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
This amounts to a short@@ fall of 14@@ 0@@ ,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation .
Many then push onto the housing market and stand in long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of rental flat@@ s .
According to the German Federal St@@ atis@@ tical Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as ten@@ ants .
The negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study points to significant fail@@ ings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
There is a current short@@ fall in urban areas of around 7@@ 70@@ ,000 living units lam@@ ents Matthias Gün@@ ther , author of the study .
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
Due to the sl@@ ump in the housing market , young adults of necessity live longer in &quot; Hotel M@@ ama &quot; .
In large towns over the last few years , the number of square metres per head has decre@@ ased for the first time .
In order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social H@@ ous@@ ing &quot; alliance suggests a fresh start .
New incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
For example land transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for sponsor@@ ed housing temporarily suspended .
In addition , according to the association , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
The K@@ f@@ W state bank &apos;s refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
On Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 18@@ 4 million – more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available – had already been requested .
The project may now even be step@@ ped up .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es have safe conduct : Croatia and Slovenia put corrid@@ or in place
Since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles .
However the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corrid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Inter@@ ior , and if necessary we will organise a corrid@@ or , &quot; said Croatian Minister for the Inter@@ ior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
After the se@@ aling off of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
Five hundred people came over the border at To@@ var@@ nik , reports Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had c@@ ord@@ oned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
Moreover , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
The Croatian Prime Minister Z@@ or@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovi@@ c explains , &quot; They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility &quot; .
These people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
They are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neigh@@ bour Croatia in the morning .
According to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They arrived at the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and in tax@@ is .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
At the Croati@@ an-@@ Serbian border the refugees did not come across border f@@ ences .
The border stri@@ ps hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
It is now planned for min@@ es@@ we@@ ep@@ ers to quickly create a safe passage .
Meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
On Tuesday police counted 3@@ 66 people that they had picked up .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,@@ 3@@ 80 .
The new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy climbing and damaging the border f@@ ences as criminal offences .
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
Those convic@@ ted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and ex@@ tradition from the country .
According to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new &quot; transition zone &quot; set up at the border , almost all – 93 – at the biggest crossing at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
In practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary .
According to opinion in Hungary , Serbia is &quot; a safe third country &quot; .
The rejected asylum seekers will be de@@ port@@ ed there .
Only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by &quot; the transition zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
Wor@@ kers have begun to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
They are collecting the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
Crow@@ d barriers are being dismant@@ led and one of the reception centres in the border town is being re@@ built .
No one wants to talk about the goal of this re@@ building .
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
According to the go@@ ver@@ ment , around 20@@ ,000 migrants are still in the country .
In Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
In Frei@@ lass@@ ing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor drives &quot; str@@ anded people &quot; over the border
&quot; We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the t@@ ent with su@@ it@@ cases , &quot; says Mayor of W@@ ern@@ stein A@@ lo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
Tour@@ ists who wanted to get to Pass@@ au by train .
Because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influ@@ x of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other help@@ ers and their cars ch@@ auff@@ eur@@ ed the str@@ anded people over the border to Pass@@ au .
Before that we enter@@ tained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks .
We said at once that we would take them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; It was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
They were very grateful .
One man insi@@ sted on hand@@ ing over a generous donation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; We were very pleased about that , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
The str@@ anded train passengers had changed trains in W@@ els on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Pass@@ au after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
But the regional train was stopped before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
In W@@ ern@@ stein , excursions over the border are generally very popular .
The Bridge Festival is a joint effort between W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kir@@ chen ; the Bridge Festival Association organis@@ es the social event on Sunday and an ath@@ le@@ tic two bridge walk the day before with their Bavarian neighbours .
The fact that Vi@@ ktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hypo@@ critical policies :
Instead of providing immediate help to the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp by construc@@ ting structures which ensure a level of humanity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government &apos;s stance closer to an atmosphere of national soci@@ alism .
It is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
Those who have fl@@ ed , too , must notice that the &quot; promised land &quot; which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
It will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create humane conditions for asylum seekers .
There is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .

Christian Kon@@ rad is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
The government has engaged the former powerful R@@ ai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen ban@@ ker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees .
Kon@@ rad has already got to gri@@ ps with the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen reception centre .
&quot; We no longer have any hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen , &quot; he reported on his first achievement .
And the accommodation of the 20@@ ,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great f@@ uss , said Kon@@ rad , pra@@ ising the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ piece &quot; .
The Minister of the Inter@@ ior , however , talked of a &quot; critical situation &quot; .
In total , Kon@@ rad estimates that accommodation for 8@@ 5,000 will be required in the current year .
In order to meet this figure , accommodation for another 35@@ ,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20@@ ,000 to be provided for by the states and 15@@ ,000 by the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can manage .
&quot; But it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; says Kon@@ rad .
He has already carried out talks with the State Govern@@ ors .
They have assured him that accommodation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
&quot; It is going well in Austria , &quot; says Ferr@@ y Ma@@ ier .
The former VP mand@@ at@@ ary is assi@@ sting Kon@@ rad .
Tom@@ orrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ din@@ al Christoph Schön@@ born , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
The asylum coordin@@ ator has also got high expectations of the OR@@ F &quot; Help the way we are &quot; campaign .
Private individuals can offer simple accommodation over this platform .
It is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often empty in winter .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier yesterday cri@@ tis@@ ised the specifications for accommodation as &quot; too high &quot; .
In times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain hei@@ ghts for tow@@ el ra@@ ils or sizes of sky@@ lights .
&quot; Emer@@ gency standards &quot; should apply for a limited period .
Kon@@ rad uses his experience as justification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Inter@@ ior , should be successful with the accommodation .
I am an older man , and nobody readily tells un@@ tru@@ ths to my face
His most important weapon is the power of persu@@ asion .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier are not co@@ sting the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
The want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted to set up a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
But apparently there are problems with obtaining approval .
Linz demanding a better allocation
For the time being the city of Linz is not planning to open new sports halls and other buildings such as the Ti@@ ps Arena or the Design Centre as accommodation for refugees .
At the moment this should not be necess@@ s@@ ary , as the people in question can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
But in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their su@@ it@@ ability .
The town chief is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
Other districts should also make their own contributions .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; Bor@@ ders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off &quot;
In a long telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , State Govern@@ or Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be c@@ ord@@ oned off .
The on@@ ward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
However appropriate border controls do now exist .
There will now no longer be any special trains with refugees travelling to Germany .
Those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ühr@@ inger once more called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
The fact that Austria is also now re@@ introducing controls at its borders is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of Germany &apos;s approach .
The next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time
The general renovation of the &quot; Neuen Wer@@ ft &quot; in the L@@ int@@ z industrial area is officially finished .
The publicly listed IT group S &amp; T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . It is planned that the rest ( 27@@ 00 m ² ) will be r@@ ented to young , innovative businesses in the technology sector .
&quot; In IT cle@@ ver heads are our raw material – and we must try to get them to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T bo@@ ss H@@ ann@@ es Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
He can imagine investing in star@@ t-@@ up businesses in Neuen Wer@@ ft , and also later acqu@@ iring these .
S &amp; T wants to collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours from the start – and Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; The next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time &quot; .
SM@@ T is investing € 1.@@ 7 million in the location and € 3.@@ 3 million is coming from T@@ ech@@ centre , a third of which belongs to each of the town of L@@ int@@ z , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
The building is le@@ ased by Linz AG to S &amp; T and T@@ ech@@ centre for 60 years .
Thir@@ ty percent of the remaining 27@@ 00 m ² in the building is already r@@ ented out and there have been en@@ quiries about the other 40 percent .
O@@ w@@ ner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni opens second business in the arc@@ ade .
In the new shop the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ ut@@ ta Br@@ eit actually wanted to get a dog .
The 4@@ 9-@@ year-old propri@@ et@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt arc@@ ade had to un@@ cerem@@ oni@@ ously postp@@ one this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
In the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business where she s@@ ells among other things bags , cases , shoes and gar@@ ments from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around Fur@@ la women &apos;s hand@@ bags ; pur@@ ses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
Lar@@ ger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
The new shop opened yesterday .
It has been converted over the last few weeks .
&quot; I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit .
Cru@@ cial for this decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la manufacturers , who are based in Bologna , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; We are the only people in the greater L@@ int@@ z area who sell this brand , &quot; said the mother of two dau@@ gh@@ ters , who herself has Italian roots .
Br@@ eit got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cra@@ dle .
It suits me best if something emerg@@ es and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
The expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag .
Perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful hand@@ bag can enhance any out@@ fit .
The bra@@ g@@ gar@@ t from K@@ all@@ stadt
The Pal@@ at@@ ine ancest@@ ors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are known as bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
This characteristic also connects many with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always the source of contro@@ vers@@ y .
Whether he is expressing xen@@ oph@@ ob@@ ic opinions , being ru@@ de to journalists or reve@@ aling gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a sti@@ r in the election campaign .
And comes out of it well .
This is also something that happens in the Pal@@ at@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ stadt , from where the property billi@@ on@@ aire &apos;s grand@@ parents origin@@ ate .
The New Yor@@ ker with the b@@ low-@@ dry hair@@ style is a concept to many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the wine route .
Many in the village of 1,@@ 200 inhabitants are related to him .
His grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el , a resident of K@@ all@@ stadt , has made a film about Tru@@ mp .
And what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of K@@ all@@ stadt people they are not deeply impressed .
The native of K@@ all@@ stadt has made an am@@ using documentary film about the place and its famous off@@ sho@@ ots , included in whom besides Tru@@ mp are also the Hein@@ z ket@@ ch@@ up family .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for his mo@@ dest@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in &quot; K@@ ings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt .
He has not won over the people there .
There is indeed a certain respect for his family &apos;s achievements , but there also tends to be a view that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit of a big@@ mouth , &quot; says W@@ end@@ el .
Co@@ inci@@ dentally , K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s nick@@ name in the region is , &quot; Die Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher &quot; , a dial@@ ect term which transl@@ ates as &quot; The Bra@@ g@@ gar@@ t &quot; , she says .
Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
The story of the Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos; success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s grand@@ father emi@@ gr@@ ated and opened a s@@ alo@@ on for gold pro@@ spec@@ tors in the USA .
The foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
But his grand@@ parents &apos; lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return permanently to their home country collap@@ sed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine then belong@@ ed .
They would not let Tru@@ mp enter as he had originally left without authorisation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ atin@@ ate History and Cultural An@@ throp@@ ology , Rol@@ and Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of &quot; illegal emi@@ grants &quot; .
This is at odds with the sometimes pi@@ thy statements of his desc@@ endant .
He has repeatedly spoken in derog@@ atory terms about Mexican immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; The f@@ uss he makes about it is not very nice , &quot; says Hans@@ -@@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; My grand@@ mother was born a Tru@@ mp , my grand@@ father was born a Hein@@ z &quot; ) .
The reti@@ red win@@ em@@ aker sees the American as rather alo@@ of , &quot; he always has a short f@@ use &quot; .
Does he think Tru@@ mp will come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 7@@ 2-@@ year-old .
&quot; He has never had any interest in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
Guest house land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm , like many of K@@ all@@ stadt &apos;s inhabitants , men@@ tions that desc@@ end@@ ants of the Hein@@ z family made a donation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine Donald doing that , &quot; says the 6@@ 8-@@ year-old .
She would prefer it if he doesn &apos;t win the election as &quot; he has such radical opinions , I don &apos;t know whether it would be a good thing &quot; .
If anyone like him had been in charge in his grand@@ father &apos;s time , &quot; he would never have gone there &quot; .
&quot; There are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says win@@ em@@ aker &apos;s daughter Sar@@ ah Büh@@ ler .
And as president ?
&quot; He &apos;s certainly not my president , &quot; she says .
And , &quot; the gra@@ pes will ri@@ pen without President Tru@@ mp &quot; .
W@@ end@@ el &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp gave a lengthy interview , has been seen by 12@@ ,000 cin@@ em@@ a-@@ go@@ ers , and interest is also growing in the USA .
The Upper Bavarian district of Ram@@ s@@ au bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Village &quot; .
The village of 1,@@ 800 inhabitants in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for &quot; Gent@@ le Tourism &quot; from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enn@@ ing , on Wednesday .
There are already 20 &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Vill@@ ages &quot; in Austria .
In our neighbouring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the distinction .
A &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ers &apos; Village &quot; is permitted to have a maximum of 2,@@ 500 residents .
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .

But when we checked in with Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski and Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows the day before three become two , they may have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently given away a clu@@ e as to who the winner will be .

All three women wa@@ x@@ ed ly@@ ri@@ cal over why W@@ ood is the perfect man , c@@ iting his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and posi@@ tivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
However when asked the question , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ ood &apos;s final rose ? , &quot; their answers could have provided a spo@@ iler as to who won the B@@ achel@@ ors heart .
Both Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o@@ ski were quick to name M@@ ack@@ ay as , apart from themselves , the best match for W@@ ood .

&quot; From the moment I wal@@ ked into the house , reading ( Sar@@ ah &apos;s ) energy and S@@ am &apos;s energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sar@@ ah is really down to earth , she &apos;s so much fun to be around , &quot; added Mark@@ o@@ ski .
I &apos;ve seen them together and they do have that chem@@ istry there .
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and S@@ am W@@ ood would be well suited as a couple .
For her part , M@@ ack@@ ay said last week &apos;s home visit dates made her realise W@@ ood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m wholeheartedly invested in him now , &quot; she said .
And asked who W@@ ood should choose if not her , she was en@@ ig@@ m@@ atic .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options of where to begin his N@@ F@@ L career .
Det@@ ro@@ it and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making in@@ quiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
But Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 4@@ 9@@ ers and coach J@@ im Tom@@ s@@ ula and it &apos;s looking like a wise decision .
Some co@@ aches would have ben@@ ched Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a f@@ um@@ ble like the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by leag@@ ue convert did on his first pun@@ t return in Tuesday &apos;s 20-@@ 3 win against M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .
But Tom@@ s@@ ula showed faith in his man , giving Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a pun@@ t and including him in the running game after an injury to Reg@@ g@@ ie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true colours in the lo@@ cker room after the game .
Instead of che@@ wing out his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also backed Hay@@ ne publicly in his post-@@ match press conference .
4@@ 9@@ ers beat re@@ porter C@@ am In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne also received encouragement from special teams co-@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne f@@ umb@@ les a pun@@ t that was recover@@ ed by the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ k@@ ings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his N@@ F@@ L de@@ but .

&quot; It was just one of those things , you just worry about the next play and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .

Because of the large number of refugees , the Freie Wähler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
At the start of the F@@ W autumn conc@@ la@@ ve , party and fac@@ tion leader Hu@@ bert Ai@@ w@@ anger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new school@@ children : &quot; We need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collap@@ sing , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; Otherwise we will have uph@@ e@@ av@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
The Freie Wähler fac@@ tion is in session in the L@@ ower Fran@@ con@@ ian community until Friday .
Very different main topics were originally planned .
But the record number of refugees is domin@@ ating the Freie Wähler meeting too .
&quot; Of course the subject of asylum is the main issue at the conc@@ la@@ ve , &quot; says Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yugosla@@ vian war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; It can &apos;t go on like this , we have to get to the causes , &quot; says the Freie Wähler head .
The Freie Wähler want to de@@ port failed asylum seekers as quickly as possible .
For this reason , Ai@@ w@@ anger also wants more personnel for the ad@@ min@@ str@@ ative courts , which are responsible for asylum cases : &quot; We need at least 50 new asylum judges as well , &quot; says Ai@@ w@@ anger .
The F@@ W head criticised the lack of consistency between several federal states : &quot; We need unified standards in the Federal states nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria de@@ ports ; others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; We must be more efficient . &quot;
However , regional politics in Gross@@ wahl@@ stadt should not be allowed to suffer .
An issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
In the new school year the Education Minister , Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CD@@ U ) , started a &quot; middle school plus &quot; pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in gramm@@ ars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry qualification ex@@ am .
But that is not enough for Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; The G@@ 9 issue must be spe@@ eded up , &quot; says the F@@ W head .
We demand freedom of choice for all gramm@@ ar schools that want it .
A free move to G@@ 9 everywhere it is wanted .

According to him investors in the German chip manufacturer are currently paying too little attention

4 K@@ illed After Police Fire Rub@@ ber Bul@@ lets at Prot@@ es@@ ters in Nepal
Four people , including a 4-@@ year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fi@@ red rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ man@@ du , the capital .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u P@@ ras@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protes@@ ters had gathered outside a police station , some of them thro@@ wing stones and fire@@ bom@@ bs .
Mr. D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police used te@@ ar gas and then fi@@ red into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
Tw@@ enty police officers and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said .
It was not immediately clear why rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less@@ -@@ le@@ th@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
The c@@ lash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say new provin@@ ces established under the proposed new constitution would di@@ lu@@ te their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent c@@ las@@ hes since Aug@@ .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provin@@ ces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly con@@ ten@@ tious issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been under@@ way since 2008 , but law@@ makers acceler@@ ated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
La@@ w@@ makers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ man@@ du this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .
Con@@ tru@@ ction area planned in the town
The plot of land at the Al@@ te Post youth centre in Em@@ den is going to be built on again .
The town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square met@@ re area .
A mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Al@@ te Post youth centre .
Pre@@ par@@ ations are currently under@@ way .
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
A spo@@ kes@@ person for the town states that it is awaiting suitable offers .
The identi@@ ties of possible investors are not yet clear .
Consequently , no contract has yet been concluded .
The town of Em@@ den sold a part of the site , situated on the Ring@@ strasse / corner of Gro@@ sse Strasse a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demo@@ lished .
H@@ ieve project : facts are in the open
Plans for the holiday home development at the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are taking shape .
Invest@@ ors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
A number of residents are again concerned – they are worried about the sale of their leisure refuge .
Plans have been negotiated , mul@@ led over , debated , and pl@@ ot@@ ted behind closed doors for months .
Now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kl@@ eines Meer near Em@@ den are in the open .
The interested party , the Em@@ den company &quot; System@@ -B@@ au &quot; , presented their plans to the Em@@ den Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening .
Origin@@ ally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
Under pressure from critics of the project and from the F@@ DP fac@@ tion , who had accused investors and the administration of sec@@ re@@ tiveness , R@@ al@@ f B@@ ehr@@ ends of the System@@ -B@@ au management went on the offensive . &quot; We don &apos;t yet have an answer for all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spec@@ t@@ ators .
But it is good to be able to counter all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
The € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Pic@@ tures and new details of the proposed hotel building prov@@ oked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Rober@@ to Schulz , property owner and member of the board of the residents &apos; lobby group , Pro H@@ ieve , claims : &quot; It &apos;s going to be a huge development which lo@@ oms over all the other buildings &quot; .
Furthermore , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enorm@@ ously due to the proposed size of the facility . &quot; We have to reck@@ on with whole bus@@ loads arriving , &quot; said Schulz .
However it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the h@@ ect@@ are sized area of the former restaurant .
No operator has yet been identified .
&quot; First of all we have to present a coherent concept , &quot; says R@@ al@@ f B@@ ehr@@ ends .
Since this does not yet exist , construction plans are still subject to vari@@ ation .

Google laun@@ ches don@@ ation-@@ matching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( G@@ O@@ OG@@ L@@ .@@ O ) announced a don@@ ation-@@ matching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations ai@@ ding the thousands of refugees that have overwhel@@ med European nations as they fle@@ e war@@ -@@ tor@@ n and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google took an un@@ character@@ is@@ tically personal approach in announc@@ ing the donation drive on its blog .
Rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fl@@ ed Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
&quot; Our journey involved many dark train and bus ri@@ des , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
The donations will go toward four non@@ profit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cu@@ e Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.@@ 5 million worth of donations globally at goo@@ g@@ le@@ .com / refuge@@ er@@ el@@ ief until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four-@@ year-old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many are also fle@@ eing war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Afghanistan , Y@@ emen , Iraq and Libya .

For mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e people with type 2 di@@ abetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
It &apos;s still to early to say whether mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e people with di@@ abetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ sur@@ g@@ ical treatments , however .
&quot; The mort@@ ality data take a long time to show up , &quot; said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an edi@@ torial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
Wei@@ ght loss operations , or b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stom@@ ach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
Over the years , b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c sur@@ geri@@ es have proved effective for treating type 2 di@@ abetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ bi@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
A BM@@ I of 25 or higher indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered o@@ bes@@ e .
You can calcul@@ ate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
For the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min@@ -Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial compar@@ ing two kinds of b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ yp@@ ass and sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 di@@ abetes in people who were mil@@ dly o@@ bes@@ e .
The average BM@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
Meanwhile , the BM@@ I among those receiving non-@@ sur@@ g@@ ical di@@ abetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
Among those who had surgery , di@@ abetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
In the medi@@ call@@ y-@@ treated group , by comparison , di@@ abetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
In addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ des , and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; was generally better in the sur@@ g@@ ical group , &quot; the authors found .
The researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
Hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better &quot; gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mort@@ ality rate at five years , according to lead resear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h-@@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and colleagues .
The research team also compared average out@@ comes with the two types of surgery .
At the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ eve gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 v@@ s 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger dro@@ ps in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 ) and in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 percent v@@ s 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete di@@ abetes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent v@@ s 16.@@ 7 percent ) .
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavi@@ er people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Ari@@ zona College of Medi@@ cin@@ e-@@ Pho@@ enix .
In the Swedish study , o@@ bes@@ e people who had b@@ ari@@ atri@@ c surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
Though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; This is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BM@@ I group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s BM@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
I think that once they &apos;ve accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into o@@ bes@@ ity and di@@ abetes , re@@ vers@@ ing that is really hard .

&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - R@@ T News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
The Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the UK .
He claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
He also stressed that , however admir@@ able , the West@@ -European countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; It it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama pra@@ ised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he empha@@ sized .
Ultim@@ ately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We have to reduce the use of force .
The use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
Ad@@ dres@@ sing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also comm@@ ented on George Bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US &quot; violent response en@@ gen@@ dered a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
After 9 / 11 I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-@@ violence .
I know his mo@@ tives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama said .
Four@@ fold increase in children ing@@ esting hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er in last 4 years
Po@@ ison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400@@ -@@ percent up@@ tick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 s@@ wal@@ lowing high@@ ly-@@ alcoho@@ lic hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er , according to the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
According to Dr. G@@ ay@@ l@@ ord L@@ op@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er in@@ ges@@ tion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ ison control centers went up from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .
&quot; Ki@@ ds are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez told CN@@ N .
He said some kids are drinking s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er inten@@ tionally , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or on a soci@@ al-@@ media dare .
Videos on YouTube show teen@@ agers drinking s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er for a cheap bu@@ z@@ z .
Te@@ ens have report@@ edly mixed s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er with alco@@ hol@@ -@@ containing mou@@ th@@ w@@ ash for a sti@@ ffer drink .
Yo@@ unger children can be drawn to attractive s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er sc@@ ents .
&quot; A k@@ id is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; L@@ op@@ ez said .
A lot of the more attractive ( hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers ) are the ones that are sc@@ ented .
There are stra@@ w@@ berry , gra@@ pe , or@@ ange@@ -@@ fla@@ vor@@ ed hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers that are very appealing to kids .
Hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
In young children , especially , only a few squ@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; It &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison control center at University of K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , told Fox 4 in K@@ ans@@ as City .
So you w@@ ouldn &apos;t leave a shot of wh@@ is@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consu@@ me a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six-@@ year-old girl who recently ing@@ ested as many as four squ@@ ir@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ ber@@ r@@ y-@@ sc@@ ented hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her bloo@@ d-@@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered legally dr@@ unk in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah was sl@@ ur@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
Doc@@ tors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; That was very sc@@ ary , &quot; Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , told CN@@ N .
It could have been very le@@ th@@ al for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alcoho@@ lic products or s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ing wi@@ pes short of moving hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er out of a child &apos;s reach .
Beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ers have been linked to deaths .
In 2013 , two On@@ t@@ ario women died after s@@ wal@@ lowing hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er that contained a toxic , un@@ declared ing@@ re@@ dient .
Health officials sur@@ mis@@ ed that the product contained me@@ than@@ ol , a de@@ adly agent , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as the active ing@@ re@@ dient .
In January , three four@@ th-@@ grade students in up@@ state New York pl@@ ot@@ ted to po@@ ison their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting anti@@ bacter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; according to a police report .
The teacher is highly all@@ erg@@ ic to hand s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ er and banned it from her room .
Police considered the fo@@ iled plan to be &quot; id@@ le chat@@ ter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

Why I &apos;m A Wit@@ ness At An Exec@@ ution In O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
Later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ th@@ al injection .
He has asked me to be one of four official witn@@ esses to his death .
The invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
As the day approaches , I &apos;ve come to d@@ read it .
So why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
Tru@@ e , journalists are permitted to watch exec@@ utions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
W@@ ho@@ ever is picked will watch it disp@@ as@@ sion@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours .
I like the guy .
We often lau@@ gh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .

Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
He doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I w@@ ouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
I &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witn@@ esses at any time .
But he wants an international re@@ porter to be there to write about it .
If he dies , he thinks the public@@ ity will help the anti-@@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be alongside me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an access@@ ory after the fact .
But I believe there is a strong prob@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And it &apos;s from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other re@@ por@@ ters you can turn to for that .
What you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death .
Man co@@ ax@@ ed from Cann@@ ing River after so@@ gg@@ y police ch@@ ase
The Cann@@ ing V@@ ale const@@ able remained dry as he co@@ ax@@ ed the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
A Per@@ th man &apos;s bid to lose a police tail came und@@ one after he found himself in sh@@ allow , mu@@ d@@ dy water just metres from a police officer trying to &quot; co@@ ax him g@@ ently back to shore . &quot;
Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police were called to a t@@ resp@@ ass@@ ing incident in B@@ eck@@ enha@@ m on Tuesday .
When they spot@@ ted the suspect he tried to di@@ t@@ ch them by heading into the Cann@@ ing River .
But he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; He was standing in the water saying &apos; I &apos;m not getting out , &apos; come and get me &apos; , &quot; Senior Ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine said .
Con@@ stable L@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ v@@ ec wasn &apos;t too keen on getting his uniform wet , so he employed a safer tac@@ tic - &quot; good police negotiation . &quot;
&quot; Sometimes people do f@@ unny things to try and escape , &quot; Senior Ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine said .
Champion foot@@ b@@ aller Ben C@@ ous@@ ins provides a memorable example .
In 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins di@@ t@@ ched his car to avoid a boo@@ ze bus and attempted to swim across the S@@ wan River .
His efforts were un@@ successful , but did insp@@ ire locals to begin planning a ton@@ gu@@ e-@@ in-@@ che@@ ek Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy alleg@@ es ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y on him and threatens to qu@@ it racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy has alleged Racing Victoria ste@@ wards attempted to plant a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to qu@@ it racing immediately .
He took aim at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , alleg@@ ing they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s positive sw@@ ab to co@@ b@@ alt , which he can not explain .
He had bitten his tongue about the sp@@ y alleg@@ ations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like s@@ our gra@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustr@@ ated it all comes out at once , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .
They know it went on .
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think I &apos;m not that &apos;s when I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be a tra@@ iner .
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence .
Ear@@ lier , M@@ oo@@ dy had dropped the bom@@ b@@ shell in a rac@@ ing@@ .com interview that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y on his stable .
&quot; Ei@@ gh@@ teen months ago Terr@@ y Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Bri@@ an Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my st@@ ables to offer information on what I was doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing@@ .com.
They obviously believe I &apos;m a che@@ at .
If that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their bri@@ efs because they &apos;ve been in@@ competent in trying to catch me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ ston , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bern@@ ard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
Should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
Has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I that bad for the industry ?
Maybe people out there think I am .
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I &apos;ve got no doubt what I &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
But I &apos;ve got to the point now where I don &apos;t care and that s@@ ad@@ dens me .
That really s@@ ad@@ dens me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I &apos;ve got the support of my family and I can walk away .
The tra@@ iner &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have built with the long-@@ running co@@ b@@ alt inquiry involving Li@@ dar@@ i and the late scrat@@ ching had him saying that he could &quot; throw my licence across the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for preparing unbe@@ aten champion Black C@@ avi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the ra@@ ce-@@ day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a mu@@ d or cla@@ y p@@ oul@@ tice had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
It &apos;s against the rules of racing .
I &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
One of my staff mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly lac@@ ed mu@@ d on its leg .
It could have had it last night .
It could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
It had it on race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three-@@ month dis@@ qualification for the race day treatment using the p@@ oul@@ tice , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
It is a jo@@ ke .
People making these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .
C@@ ob@@ ram h@@ it-@@ and-@@ run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a h@@ it-@@ and-@@ run col@@ li@@ sion with a cy@@ cli@@ st in C@@ ob@@ ram at the weekend .
The cy@@ cli@@ st was air@@ li@@ fted to the Royal Mel@@ bour@@ ne Hospital with serious in@@ jur@@ ies after being struck by a car on the Mur@@ ray Valley High@@ way on Saturday morning .
Police said the motor@@ ist dro@@ ve away without st@@ opping to help the injured ri@@ der .
On Monday a 50-@@ year-old N@@ ath@@ alia man handed himself in to police at Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident , failing to render assistance , and other traffic offences .

Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y h@@ its back at ri@@ vals over w@@ rest@@ ling claims
Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the N@@ R@@ L &apos;s two pre@@ m@@ ier@@ ship favour@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson said the refer@@ ees allowed the Stor@@ m to &quot; w@@ res@@ tle &quot; his side during the Stor@@ m &apos;s up@@ set win in the quali@@ fying final in Sydney on Friday night .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos coach W@@ ay@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a thin@@ ly vei@@ led reference to the Stor@@ m after his side &apos;s quali@@ fying final win over North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night when he called that game a &quot; show@@ case &quot; of the rug@@ by leag@@ ue and said the two Que@@ ens@@ land weren &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ am@@ y defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
Bell@@ am@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ aches critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Stor@@ m be@@ ating them .
&quot; That keeps coming up - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson bring up w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24-@@ 2 , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our def@@ ensive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackl@@ es and that has been the turn around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
It &apos;s f@@ unny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bell@@ am@@ y challeng@@ ed B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; remin@@ ding his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s St Geor@@ ge-@@ Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ g@@ ons won the pre@@ m@@ ier@@ ship in 2010 by playing &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; football .
W@@ ay@@ ne is talking about exciting foot@@ y .
He made a point of compar@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and W@@ ay@@ ne said he didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ar@@ se .
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foot@@ y , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
That &apos;s the foot@@ y you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
He made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foot@@ y - not every team has two hal@@ ves like Anth@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like that .
To me it buil@@ ds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
Six weeks ago they probably weren &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out the Stor@@ m and R@@ oo@@ sters game was a higher sc@@ oring contest than the Bron@@ cos and C@@ ow@@ boys game .
The Bron@@ cos game was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t wat@@ ched it yet but what was the score ? 16-@@ 12 ?
Our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foot@@ y ?
Or is it making breaks and not sc@@ oring tries that is exciting ?
To me it &apos;s agen@@ das .
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
The Stor@@ m have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ ark@@ s in next Saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 200@@ k b@@ ail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine that was smu@@ gg@@ led into Que@@ ens@@ land has been granted b@@ ail on a $ 200@@ ,000 sur@@ ety .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tra@@ cked 100 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of the drug from the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and do@@ cked at Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed meeting with his co-@@ accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house caf@@ e , where police found 40 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of the drug in a To@@ y@@ ota Ech@@ o .
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the caf@@ e for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Ju@@ dge Peter F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an was concerned Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was a flight risk .
He has clear connections to Serbia .
He tra@@ vels to Serbia often , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
On the cro@@ wn case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic &apos;s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a sur@@ ety of $ 200@@ ,000 to secure his release .
&quot; Having read the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of both those persons , it is clear that the im@@ position of a sur@@ ety of $ 200@@ ,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , &quot; Ju@@ dge F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an said .
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was granted b@@ ail on the conditions that he sur@@ render both his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sports , report to police on a daily basis and adher@@ es to a 6@@ p@@ m-@@ 6@@ am cur@@ few .

A pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used an 11-@@ year-old girl &apos;s phone to so@@ lic@@ it child abuse images .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she sle@@ pt then log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service where he had a succ@@ ession of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping H@@ og@@ g &apos;s hand .
She looked through it and found the distur@@ bing messages before immediately al@@ er@@ ting her mother .
Police attended and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web se@@ arches using terms for finding in@@ decent image of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les &quot; on the internet before &quot; pret@@ ending he was a police officer to sc@@ are them . &quot;
Fis@@ cal dep@@ ute E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; He said it was an ad@@ diction - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to scar@@ ing people .
He accepted the se@@ arches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ tend to be a police officer to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les .
He was asked about his convers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
He said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rap@@ e and murder images .
Ms Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; When the girl found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was sha@@ king and cr@@ ying .
She saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
The girl was inter@@ viewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , of W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty on indic@@ t@@ ment to charges of taking or making in@@ decent images of children on June 14 last year , bre@@ aching b@@ ail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
Defence so@@ lic@@ it@@ or Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g not be placed on the sex offen@@ ders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ sta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael de@@ fer@@ red sentence until October for social work background reports .
H@@ og@@ g was granted b@@ ail in this case but was held in cust@@ ody ahead of hear@@ ings on other outstanding cases .
He was placed on the sex offen@@ ders register ahead of his sent@@ encing date .
Traff@@ ick@@ ers move towards Germany over minor border cross@@ ings .
More and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the German-@@ Austrian border .
Due to fear of discovery and people being arrested , many traff@@ ick@@ ers are leaving
through minor borders on the Austrian side , says a spo@@ kes@@ person for the Federal police .
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of Inn in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal@@ -@@ Inn since Tuesday .
They had arrived on foot over bridges and wei@@ rs on the German side .
They are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration .
According to reports from the Federal police , significantly more refugees arrived at the main railway station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week .
By 8 a.m. about 700 people had arrived in the capital city of the state , said a spo@@ kes@@ person in the morning .

The ch@@ assis makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IA@@ A
In 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
Comp@@ act class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport ( K@@ BA ) about 28@@ .@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ str@@ ations in August alone belong@@ ed to this segment .
This is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
In among all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and the new high-@@ end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
One of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ier@@ es for the German car sector here is the Op@@ el A@@ stra , which h@@ its the car deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; The A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Op@@ el bo@@ ss Kar@@ l-@@ Thomas Ne@@ um@@ ann at the show .
It is at the heart of the brand .
To ensure that it s@@ ells well , the price of the new A@@ stra is not increasing significantly .
Op@@ el proposes an entry point below that of its main competi@@ tor , the V@@ W Golf , which starts at € 17@@ ,@@ 650 .
The latest A@@ stra costs from € 16@@ ,@@ 9@@ 90 .
With a new 1.4 li@@ tre engine , the A@@ stra has an output of 74 k@@ w / 100 h@@ p .
The H@@ essi@@ an manufacturer also offers diesel and pet@@ rol engines from 70 k@@ w / 95 h@@ p to 14@@ 7 k@@ w / 200 h@@ p , including the first three cy@@ linder pet@@ rol model .
Unlike its most important competitors , V@@ W Golf and Ford Focus , for the first time the Op@@ el A@@ stra is only available as a five door .
In spring the estate car , already seen at the IA@@ A , will follow as the second option
And what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A ?
Ren@@ ault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Ren@@ ault introduces the fourth generation of its competi@@ tor to the A@@ stra , the Mé@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
The Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-@@ door , in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly spor@@ ty version .
It will be available in deal@@ er@@ ships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in this segment .
The N@@ iss@@ an off@@ shoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
The compact Infin@@ iti , with its cur@@ ved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
The basic model will have a pet@@ rol engine with a performance of at least 90 k@@ w / 12@@ 2 h@@ p .
A diesel with 80 k@@ w / 10@@ 9 h@@ p or 125 k@@ w / 170 h@@ p is also on offer .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : also new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celeb@@ rates its world premi@@ ere in Frankfurt .
On offer is the pet@@ rol engine model , including a newly developed 1.0 li@@ tre tur@@ bo engine and a performance of 82 k@@ w / 1@@ 11 h@@ p .
According to the man@@ fac@@ tur@@ er &apos;s specifications , the maximum tor@@ que is 170 New@@ ton metres ( N@@ m ) .
The Bal@@ eno is launched in Europe in early 20@@ 16 .
DS@@ 4 : not totally new , but completely re@@ designed , is the DS 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
The designers at the class@@ y Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n off@@ shoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radi@@ ator gri@@ lle has been newly designed and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with LED technology .
In the interior the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system in particular has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play has been incorporated .
In the compact class the IA@@ A also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Merc@@ edes A Class or the P@@ eu@@ ge@@ ot 30@@ 8 .
J@@ VA Berlin T@@ egel : five-@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ met@@ re cells are un@@ fit for human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court has uph@@ eld a complaint by a former in@@ m@@ ate of T@@ egel prison that he had been hous@@ ed for months in too small a cell .
In principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
The Federal Constitutional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday .
According to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( re@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 12@@ 7 / 14 ) .
For this reason a former pris@@ oner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . He was det@@ ained in Berlin T@@ egel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres : the toilet was not in a separate room .
After@@ wards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was transferred to a larger cell .
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of un@@ suitable prison conditions however , failed .
But the constitutional judges set aside the jud@@ gement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and res@@ ub@@ mitted the case there for renewed assessment .
In their view the human dignity of the man had been violated .
The Supreme Court is now deciding the amount of the damages .
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in cust@@ ody are significant for compensation , enti@@ t@@ lement to a claim for compensation exists .
Otherwise there would be &quot; fears of deterioration of a person &apos;s right to protection &quot; .
The Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pec@@ uni@@ ary compensation .
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
As recently as April they awarded damages to a pris@@ oner because he had been locked in his cell n@@ aked .
A cell with multiple functions and without a separate toilet is also in@@ humane , according to a decision from 2011 .
Furthermore Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the Berlin Constitutional Court , a pris@@ oner in a parallel case in November 2009 had att@@ ested to in@@ humane accommodation
The pris@@ oner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Karlsruhe case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
Because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness rises and it has even led to bra@@ w@@ ls due to the ten@@ se situation .
According to information from the press office of the public prosec@@ utor , 21 positions in T@@ egel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will cease to exist in 20@@ 16 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; We can handle it &quot;
The influ@@ x of refugees is an enormous challenge – the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What changes will we see in Germany ?
According to the predic@@ tions of the Federal Minister of the Inter@@ ior , around 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el ( SP@@ D ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . &quot; I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it &quot; .
The following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
According to various forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation by the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) homes will be needed annually – and in fact for the next five years .
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 25@@ 0@@ ,000 homes ) .
The lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : between 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social d@@ well@@ ings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
Federal building minister Barbar@@ a H@@ end@@ ri@@ cks ( SP@@ D ) thus wants to double funding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
In the view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute this is far too little : 80@@ ,000 social d@@ well@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
Aca@@ dem@@ ics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
However the refugees in Germany are not being systematically asked about their qualifications so as to be able to help them get started , criticised Clau@@ dia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the Ber@@ tel@@ sm@@ ann Foundation .
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self-@@ est@@ e@@ em of the im@@ migrant says migration resear@@ cher Di@@ et@@ rich Th@@ rän@@ hardt .
According to Th@@ rän@@ hardt , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
While in the past asylum seekers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asylum seekers to one place of dom@@ ici@@ le .
As far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
One big obstacle to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work@@ -@@ related language courses .
Studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
Thus , in Th@@ rän@@ hardt &apos;s view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
The Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in k@@ inder@@ garten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . &quot; For the u@@ pro@@ oted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spo@@ kes@@ man for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Sen@@ ate administration .
To be able to convince families of the benefits of k@@ inder@@ gar@@ tens , the administration is issuing le@@ af@@ lets in a number of languages .
If the need for teachers increases sharp@@ ly because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Sen@@ ate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical coll@@ eg@@ es .
In the states , pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
There is no shortage of these , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or those with long-term refugee status from studying – the only exception up to now was Berlin : Sen@@ ator for the Inter@@ ior Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has however now abandoned his stance .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es who want to study may have their entrance to university facilit@@ ated .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es with a residence permit or protection against de@@ port@@ ation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
In principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
T@@ oler@@ ated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 20@@ 16 this period is reduced to 15 months .
But this financing gap must also be closed , claim St@@ eff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
The students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-@@ church law should be developed into a state-@@ religion relationship .
The founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arri@@ vals in a professional manner , is also important .
Rights also involve responsibilities .
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to conc@@ ede certain control options .
This also requires the read@@ iness to act courage@@ ously against religious fundament@@ alism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ ye@@ k , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
Those who want to wage such conflict in Germany &quot; have immediately for@@ fei@@ ted their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said on Bavarian radio .
He suggested transl@@ ating this basic law into Arab@@ ic .
In the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
This means too that mainstre@@ am society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent .
For nearly 10 years , as a result of European rul@@ ings , Germany has had an anti-@@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
But it is learning very slowly , as the N@@ S@@ U murder series shows , that rac@@ ist mo@@ tives are systematically ignored in the police and the authorities .
Equ@@ al opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and non-@@ white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international treaties such as the anti racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens – for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doc@@ tors &apos; Association , Frank Ul@@ rich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; As far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we can cope , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel .
However extra money must be added to the system for this .
In order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asked for all new arri@@ vals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
Services provided can be accoun@@ ted for with the Federal states later .
And in the long term it is highly doub@@ t@@ ful that so many people can be f@@ ob@@ bed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Ben@@ ef@@ its for Asyl@@ um Se@@ ek@@ ers Act provides .
Apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language barrier .
Up to now , as Berlin health resear@@ cher The@@ a Bor@@ de has established , migrants have received poorer information about their ill@@ nesses than other patients .
Interpre@@ ters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors &apos; practices , she demands .
But many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine dro@@ p-@@ in centres in emergency rooms .
And with a different diagno@@ stic view .
Ref@@ u@@ gee children for example clearly suffer from more un@@ treated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery
&quot; Par@@ asi@@ te inf@@ ections or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not that difficult to recognise . &quot; And because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
To be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exam@@ s .
In the estim@@ ation of the Federal Psy@@ cho@@ therapeutic Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are ment@@ ally ill : most of them are suffering from post-@@ traum@@ atic stress dis@@ order or depression .
Ref@@ u@@ gee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
A so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be published study by the T@@ U in Munich documents that every fifth Syri@@ an refugee child arri@@ ves traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
Those who suffer from post-@@ traum@@ atic stress dis@@ order suffer among other things from so-called f@@ las@@ h@@ backs , difficulties in brea@@ thing , di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration dis@@ orders , ner@@ v@@ ousness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
In order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
Up to now , however , only four percent of ment@@ ally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
Ment@@ ally ill asylum seekers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
In addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psychological ill@@ nesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This frequently leads to false assessments , says Mun@@ z .
The ring invites you to dream
With their new &quot; Pas@@ sion &quot; production , Cir@@ cus Prob@@ st is returning to the traditions of the art of the cir@@ cus .
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mes@@ mer@@ ising acro@@ b@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
Now Cir@@ cus Prob@@ st is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Zi@@ egel@@ w@@ asen .
&quot; Our passion is our cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ie Prob@@ st , animal tra@@ iner and junior manager .
&quot; Pas@@ sion &quot; - this is the motto for the current production in the ring .
The cir@@ cus has been owned by the Prob@@ st family for over 33 years .
The family has the gift of enth@@ r@@ alling people in their blood .
&quot; It &apos;s important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old junior manager .
Director Rein@@ hard Prob@@ st calls his concept a &quot; Cock@@ tail in the ring with a co@@ smopoli@@ tan fla@@ ir &quot; .
Fif@@ ty towns have the chance to experience this fla@@ ir on the almost 3000 kilomet@@ re-@@ long tour .
The cir@@ cus programme wins people over with tal@@ ented artists from all over the world .
Di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ished at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v c@@ lown family cap@@ tiv@@ ate the public with wi@@ t and charm .
The Cas@@ till@@ o brothers , too , know their craft .
The Cuban du@@ o are ready to compete with the her@@ oes of silent films .
Ligh@@ tness and ag@@ ility - these words sum them up .
Their hum@@ or@@ ous arti@@ stry on the pole will win the women &apos;s hearts .
Apart from causing numerous bur@@ sts of lau@@ ghter , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ st &apos;s acro@@ b@@ ats are also mes@@ mer@@ ising with their fin@@ esse and suppl@@ eness .
Bal@@ ancing on a ball with a unic@@ y@@ cle ?
No problem for He Yu@@ an .
Con@@ tor@@ tion@@ ists enth@@ r@@ all and ter@@ rif@@ y at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in , from China , is better acqu@@ ain@@ ted with the oldest form of acro@@ b@@ atics than most and thri@@ ll@@ s with his flexibility .
Six@@ ty enter@@ tain@@ ers from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; The animals belong to our family , &quot; insi@@ sts St@@ ap@@ han@@ ie &apos;s mother , Bri@@ g@@ itte Prob@@ st .
Differ@@ ent animal welfare organisations all too often compl@@ ain about mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of cir@@ cus animals .
Steph@@ an@@ ie Prob@@ st has her own answer to this : &quot; If our animals aren &apos;t happy , then nor are we &quot; .
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every bit of attention .
The &quot; four-@@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately known , have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible .
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go in the ring either .
So the top priority is to look after the animals well .
The Prob@@ st family are especially proud of their z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id , J@@ umb@@ o - the off@@ spring of a Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony st@@ alli@@ on and a z@@ eb@@ ra mare .
The two animals lived together in one en@@ closure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; Then suddenly there was our little J@@ umb@@ o , &quot; says Bri@@ g@@ itte Prob@@ st .
But the z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , instead he is a unique little mas@@ co@@ t for the Cir@@ cus Prob@@ st .
There is something for every visitor .
&quot; One thing is for certain , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ie Prob@@ st , &quot; regardless of whether there are five or 1,@@ 200 people in the audience , we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts .
Cir@@ cus Prob@@ st invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
The programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
Thursday is family day ; there is a discount on the price of the show .
And the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ dium .
He was un@@ h@@ urt , but video of the fall went vir@@ al on social media .
The opening of parliament was also tar@@ nis@@ hed by claims by opposition legislat@@ ors that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
Last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ kl@@ ed him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
Mo@@ vement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) chief whi@@ p In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to dis@@ rupt N@@ r Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s ti@@ tled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech .
It war@@ ns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
The chief whi@@ p said the party , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard to cut up to 30@@ ,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard expects to cut 25@@ ,000 to 30@@ ,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-@@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is split@@ ting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and printer businesses from its fast@@ er-@@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
As a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evol@@ ving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise will have more than $ 50@@ b@@ n in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering un@@ ri@@ val@@ ed integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930@@ s by Stan@@ ford University gradu@@ ates Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t and Da@@ ve Pack@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to garage has been du@@ b@@ bed &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ lic@@ on Valley . &quot;
HP has been under@@ going a massive re@@ organisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
The move by HP , the world &apos;s second-@@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
Ar@@ senal cap@@ tain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says te@@ am-@@ m@@ ates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of Din@@ amo Zagreb tie
W@@ enger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
That best-@@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s European Championship is clearly uncertain .
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished last season strongly after a separate ank@@ le injury and then looked back to his old sharp@@ ness during pre-@@ season .
&quot; This kind of injury is not care@@ er-@@ threatening , &quot; said W@@ enger .
It is a bone that did not he@@ al well .
It is nothing major .
This was just an accident .
It was not linked with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the in@@ jur@@ ies he had before .
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as W@@ enger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further in@@ jur@@ ies whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
There is also an un@@ comfortable pattern developing .
Research by Premier In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere ail@@ ments since he made his de@@ but six years ago .
He has also played in only 65 of Ar@@ senal &apos;s 15@@ 7 leag@@ ue games during the last five seasons .
The wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-@@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Ar@@ senal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
&quot; Sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
With Ar@@ senal beginning their Champ@@ ions League campaign on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb ahead of matches with Ch@@ el@@ sea on Saturday and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur next Wednesday , W@@ enger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aar@@ on Ram@@ sey have not trav@@ elled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ thi@@ eu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
W@@ enger may also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d in place of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Although Ar@@ senal are clear favour@@ ites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe &apos;s most intim@@ id@@ ating .
Din@@ amo are also unbe@@ aten in 41 matches after producing their own &quot; Inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign last season .
The stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night by an earth tre@@ m@@ or that measured 3.2 on the Richter .
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year .
W@@ enger believes that Ar@@ senal have learnt the lesson of last season &apos;s Champ@@ ions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup tri@@ umph .
&quot; This drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
It has never been done at Ar@@ senal .
We were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
We are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is g@@ lar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desper@@ ate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young m@@ ales at 15 year high .
In 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-@@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in m@@ ales than fem@@ ales .
In a bid to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( C@@ AL@@ M ) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Fri@@ end@@ ship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2@@ ,000 high-@@ school students disp@@ laying de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of recover@@ ing doub@@ led .
Equ@@ ally , for those not de@@ pressed , a circle of ment@@ ally healthy friends hal@@ ved the chances of mental challenges arising .
But of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
In this age of soci@@ al-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immedi@@ acy of response is often priori@@ ti@@ sed over meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doub@@ led the need to appear strong , fun@@ -@@ lo@@ ving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
This super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists term ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner year@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply imp@@ acts our mental health .
And as a billi@@ on@@ aire vide@@ o-@@ game cre@@ ator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater happiness .
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
Each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their person@@ alities , which sh@@ one through the interaction as friends .
The hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the com@@ fy chairs , and Ro@@ ss &apos;s p@@ ining for R@@ ach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
As a Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker explained to me : .... &quot; my listening role to people feeling de@@ pressed and suici@@ dal has really highlighted how even the smallest inter@@ actions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
O@@ ften the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
The old ad@@ age of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
As much as my objective , out@@ si@@ der status over the phone helps people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
And so , if you attend Com@@ edy Central &apos;s Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
Or , better still , if in Star@@ bu@@ cks you see someone alone , give a s@@ mile and say h@@ ello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends is broadcasting on Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the full 23@@ 6 epis@@ odes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
Di Maria scores to help PS@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
Ang@@ el Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after sc@@ oring against Mal@@ mo .
Ang@@ el Di Maria sc@@ ored on his Champ@@ ions League de@@ but to help PS@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
Here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
Ang@@ el Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris Saint-@@ Ger@@ main began their Champ@@ ions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-@@ 0 win against Mal@@ mo at the Parc des Prin@@ ces on Tuesday .
Di Maria sc@@ ored less than four minutes into his Champ@@ ions League de@@ but as a PS@@ G player to set the French champ@@ ions on their way , but they missed a succ@@ ession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
With Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ ar Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champ@@ ions as they target not just qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ tage display by Laur@@ ent Blan@@ c &apos;s side with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic wast@@ eful in front of goal and later being sub@@ stituted against his hom@@ et@@ own team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champ@@ ions League , so to win 2-@@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &quot; said Blan@@ c .
It au@@ g@@ urs well .
We wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-@@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ deaux in Lig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ st@@ aged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
The Argentina w@@ inger was lab@@ elled as the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
However , if anyone then expected PS@@ G to rom@@ p to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Cel@@ tic in a play@@ -@@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internation@@ als on the field at k@@ ick@@ -@@ off and , with a five-@@ man defence and two deep in mid@@ field , were stu@@ ff@@ y opponents .
But , save for a Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that sli@@ d just wide of Kev@@ in T@@ rap@@ p &apos;s far post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , PS@@ G let themselves down at times with some wast@@ eful passing and poor finishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the rest@@ art .
Nevertheless , he proved much more a@@ dep@@ t when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic pass that Di Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had fli@@ cked on a left-@@ wing cross from Max@@ well .
That ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by Wil@@ and from point@@ -@@ blan@@ k range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ ez@@ zi had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted PS@@ G were a class above his side , the Norweg@@ ian saying : &quot; Our last Champ@@ ions League game was in December last year . &quot;
Since then we have only played in the Swedish leag@@ ue which is not the same level .
The quali@@ fi@@ ers are not enough .
H@@ ats off to Paris .
It was a magnificent match from them .
Gl@@ en@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swis@@ s-@@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , hit by collap@@ sing commodities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast deb@@ t-@@ s@@ las@@ hing plan .
Lond@@ on-@@ listed Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.@@ 6 billion to pay down debt .
The company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is gra@@ p@@ pling with tum@@ bling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic slow@@ down weigh@@ s on demand and spark@@ s ha@@ vo@@ c across markets .
The rights issue sent Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s share price so@@ aring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
Shar@@ es j@@ ump@@ ed 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.@@ 5-@@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to s@@ lash its $ 30 billion debt pi@@ le by about a third .
The company sold the new stock at 125 p@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4-@@ percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday .
It off@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
Conc@@ ern@@ s over pro@@ long@@ ed st@@ alled Chinese growth have s@@ las@@ hed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es arrive in Wei@@ mar
On Tuesday afternoon 49 people reach the municipality of Wei@@ mar after a mostly long flight .
The refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia .
The yo@@ ung@@ est arrival is a six month old girl from Syria .
White House Con@@ firms X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping &apos;s Washington Visit
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday .
The visit , X@@ i &apos;s first official one to Washington , will take place on S@@ ept . 25 and reciproc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
The U.S. President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
&quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will present an opportunity to expand U.@@ S.@@ -@@ China cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mutual interest , while also enabling President Obama and President X@@ i to address areas of dis@@ agreement construc@@ tively , &quot; the statement added .
X@@ i , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U.@@ N@@ . General Assembly on S@@ ept .
Obama and X@@ i are expected to bro@@ ach a range of con@@ ten@@ tious issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns over China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber@@ es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and its increasing asser@@ tiveness in the disp@@ uted waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion X@@ avi has played for the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club in Q@@ atar since summer 2015 .
A few years ago , FC Bayern was apparently close to committ@@ ing to Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
Ei@@ ght times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champ@@ ions League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - X@@ avi &apos;s list of titles is breath@@ -@@ taking .
In the summer the then 3@@ 5-@@ year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Q@@ atar and the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club .
But in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
&quot; I was told that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; At the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren &apos;t , &quot; he says .
And FC Bayern noticed that too .
X@@ avi : &quot; There was an offer from Bayern . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
A quick remin@@ der : in the summer of 2008 , Jür@@ gen Klin@@ sm@@ ann took over at FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not transfer .
The transfer never happened .
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion : P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why . &quot; Bar@@ ça had signed on Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a brilliant European Championship . &quot;
&quot; Pep@@ e told me that I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t transfer , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; He got me with that . &quot;
Who knows how Bayern &apos;s 2008 / 2009 season would have turned out if X@@ avi had left .
X@@ avi covered the entire distance on the tur@@ f for Bar@@ ça in the quarter final of the Champ@@ ions League against Bayern , kno@@ cked the Red@@ s out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the premi@@ ere class tri@@ umph .
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on down@@ plays diversity in film@@ making
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on confronted Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
During Sunday night &apos;s episode of H@@ B@@ O &apos;s Project Green@@ light , the seas@@ oned actor cut Brown off while she was empha@@ si@@ zing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play .
&quot; When we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on asser@@ ted .
Sho@@ cked , Brown re@@ acted with off@@ ended dis@@ belief , letting out &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . Ok@@ ay , &quot; as The Mar@@ tian actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
Dam@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would urge people to think about -- wh@@ o@@ ever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown initially said .
The only black character who &apos;s a h@@ oo@@ ker who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
The De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ tor@@ ted their direc@@ ting could &quot; end up giving us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
After the discussion ai@@ red , social media explo@@ ded in dis@@ approval over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr@@ Po@@ oni expressed anger toward the cli@@ p writing , &quot; Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is S@@ O W@@ H@@ ITE it hur@@ ts . &quot;
The t@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4@@ ,000 likes since being posted .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time where accurate ra@@ cial representation in media is at the for@@ efront of social discussion .
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement took nation@@ wide effect , ur@@ ging law@@ makers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
In February , singer Prince all@@ u@@ ded to the movement while introducing the nom@@ ine@@ es of Album of the Year at the Gr@@ amm@@ y Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums still matter , &quot; he said .
Like books and black lives , alb@@ ums still matter .
More recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisab@@ eth Has@@ sel@@ beck &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a h@@ ate group .
&quot; The Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , &quot; leaders said .
Dam@@ on was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gul@@ s invited to visit the P@@ ope to discuss the Catholic Church &apos;s portra@@ yal in the West .
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the P@@ ope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ns first champion
Pro-@@ rock clim@@ ber and bus@@ boy I@@ sa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete to win American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
The competition show , which just wra@@ pped up its 7th season , has never seen any competi@@ tor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
During the season fin@@ ale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , made it to the final round .
The final task involved climbing a 7@@ 5-@@ foot ro@@ pe in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first-@@ ever ath@@ l@@ ete to complete American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos;s gru@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about , like I &apos;ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , &quot; I@@ sa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pay@@ -@@ b@@ ump .
So to all of a sudden ... like I can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer K@@ ent W@@ eed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ ale and why , despite B@@ ritten being the first ever competi@@ tor to finish the course , won &apos;t be awarded any prize money .
By the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; If there &apos;s more than one fin@@ is@@ her , the one with the fastest time gets it , &quot; said W@@ eed .
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great grati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he har@@ b@@ ors any ill will about it .
He &apos;s just so happy to have done what he &apos;s done .
He &apos;s received tons of acc@@ ol@@ ades from fans .
He &apos;s such a great guy , and a family man .
He &apos;s a her@@ o to his kids and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I was going to be beat by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s I@@ sa@@ ac . &quot;
And I think I@@ sa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were re@@ vers@@ ed .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was renewed for an eigh@@ th season , which will begin fil@@ ming in Spring 20@@ 16 .
Det@@ ro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers ti@@ p@@ to@@ e past M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS -- The second half the season has@@ n &apos;t been a lot of fun for the Det@@ ro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers .
Once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , the T@@ ig@@ ers are now in last place in the American League Central .
Re@@ duc@@ ing to being a spo@@ iler , the T@@ ig@@ ers played the part perfectly Tuesday , be@@ ating the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins 5-@@ 4 at Tar@@ get F@@ ield .
The T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to climb to within one-@@ half game of the Hou@@ ston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wil@@ d-@@ card spot .
For Det@@ ro@@ it , if only for one night , it was a return of the three-@@ letter F-@@ word that has been so el@@ u@@ sive over much of the season &apos;s second half .
&quot; All wins are fun , no matter how it happens , &quot; T@@ ig@@ ers manager Bra@@ d Aus@@ mus said .
T@@ ig@@ ers pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Det@@ ro@@ it sc@@ ored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then tack@@ ed one in the sixth and one more in the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13@@ -@@ 9 ) pit@@ ched 6 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three runs .
It was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
&quot; I just want to finish strong this year , &quot; Simon said .
It &apos;s hard for the bul@@ l@@ pen to throw every game , and that &apos;s why I want to go deep into the game .
T@@ ig@@ ers designated hit@@ ter Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three h@@ its and dro@@ ve in two runs , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid-@@ August .
It was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three-@@ hit night since he had four h@@ its against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; He sw@@ ung the bat well , &quot; Aus@@ mus said .
He looked good in ( bat@@ ting practice ) , looked notic@@ e@@ ably better in B@@ P , and he carried it right into the game .
Tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the s@@ eventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
Right fiel@@ der Aar@@ on H@@ ic@@ ks reached on a bun@@ t single , and Simon got second bas@@ em@@ an Bri@@ an Do@@ zi@@ er to strike out sw@@ ing@@ ing before being li@@ fted for left-@@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy wal@@ ked Mauer , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ ok@@ ie designated hit@@ ter Miguel S@@ ano , who ri@@ pped a two-@@ run single to left off right-@@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Ver@@ Ha@@ gen .
With a pair of run@@ ners on and the t@@ ying run at second , Ver@@ Ha@@ gen got third bas@@ em@@ an Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e to ground into a double play .
It was the maj@@ or-@@ leag@@ u@@ e-@@ leading 27@@ th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e hit into a DP .
After Det@@ ro@@ it tack@@ ed on an insurance run in the top of the nin@@ th , Mauer ri@@ pped an R@@ B@@ I double to the gap against T@@ ig@@ ers closer Bru@@ ce R@@ ond@@ on to make it 5-@@ 4 .
However , the right-@@ h@@ ander struck out S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Det@@ ro@@ it took advantage of a ru@@ sty Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es in the early going .
The T@@ ig@@ ers posted three runs in the first two inn@@ ings against the veter@@ an right-@@ h@@ ander , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back infl@@ amm@@ ation .
&quot; Obviously not the start I &apos;d like to have , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
After getting the le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ hes gave up a single to second bas@@ em@@ an I@@ an K@@ ins@@ ler .
A two-@@ out walk to right fiel@@ der J@@ .@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who sing@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z sn@@ apped his 0-@@ for@@ -@@ 21 stre@@ ak with run@@ ners in sc@@ oring position .
Third bas@@ em@@ an N@@ ick Castell@@ anos followed with a single to right , sc@@ oring another run , but Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
The T@@ ig@@ ers added on in the second , getting a one-@@ out double from cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two-@@ out single by center fiel@@ der Anth@@ ony Go@@ se to make it 3-@@ 0 .
&quot; That was a big hit , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor said .
He didn &apos;t hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es , who was on a pit@@ ch count , pit@@ ched a sc@@ or@@ eless third inning before being replaced by right-@@ handed reli@@ ever A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was charged with three runs on six h@@ its and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
N@@ OT@@ ES : T@@ ig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was shut down with a stra@@ in in his thro@@ wing shoulder .
He will be examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed surgery on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder back in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the disabled list with a shoulder stra@@ in since mid-@@ August , was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start .
With San@@ che@@ z out , L@@ HP Daniel Nor@@ ris will come off the D@@ L to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris is 1-@@ 1 in four starts with the T@@ ig@@ ers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .
He has been out since Aug@@ . 20 with a stra@@ ined right obli@@ que .
The T@@ ig@@ ers and T@@ wins will wra@@ p up their three-@@ game series at Tar@@ get F@@ ield on Wednesday .
Nor@@ ris ( 2-@@ 2 , 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will oppose M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5-@@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ER@@ A ) .
H@@ und@@ reds of refugees to be given accommodation in Wies@@ baden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
They are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
The people who have trav@@ elled there will then be hous@@ ed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wies@@ baden , according to a statement made by the city of Wies@@ baden on Tuesday evening .
They estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
A number of sports halls in the H@@ essi@@ an capital have been prepared for this eventu@@ ality over the last few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommodation in these .
After this they should be re@@ distributed to other communities .
According to a statement by the regional council of Gi@@ essen , responsible for their initial reception , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse in the past ten days alone
Due to the large number of refugees , emergency shel@@ ter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Han@@ au .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
&quot; I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
He accused the European nations of &quot; coll@@ ectively looking the other way &quot; .
Four years ago one would have been happy for the ch@@ ali@@ ce of military involvement to pass Germany by .
&quot; Now the conflict has come cr@@ ash@@ ing down at our front door , &quot; he said on the German World Service .
The former German Ambass@@ ador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Inter@@ ior Minister , Johann@@ a Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner , stated on the Austrian television channel OR@@ F on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary .
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; No , that is the agreement , &quot; she confirmed .
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
Over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route .
Most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
On Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
At a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory re@@ distribution of a further 120@@ ,000 refugees .
In view of the heavy influ@@ x of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people .
The Federal government will manage this jointly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
But those who have no prospects of permanent resi@@ dency will not be able to stay in Germany .
This opinion is also clearly generally shared .
The Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a &quot; huge effort &quot; .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of desper@@ ate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route .
On Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia .
A few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to seal off the border with Romania with a f@@ ence .
Unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent people smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to about the planned new border f@@ ences .
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
The first arres@@ ts of people who had bre@@ ached the f@@ ence have taken place .
In Turkey mean@@ while , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders .
&quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; space probe finds ocean on Satur@@ n &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
Under the ic@@ y cr@@ ust of Satur@@ n &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ las@@ hes a global ocean .
Scienti@@ sts have de@@ duced this from ob@@ serving the &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; space probe
This is the reason the moon w@@ ob@@ bles slightly in its or@@ bit of the ring@@ ed planet .
This w@@ ob@@ bling is only minor , but nevertheless too much for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ ica in the US state of New York .
The scientists have published their findings in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; scientific journ@@ al .
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &apos;s cr@@ ust of ice .
&quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes , which spe@@ w water va@@ pour and ice partic@@ les that feed the so-called E ring of Satur@@ n , at the south pole of this moon in 2006 .
Ast@@ onom@@ ers concluded at the time that there had to be a sub@@ surface sea at least at the south pole .
The extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama ab@@ sent from 18@@ 60 Munich for several weeks
18@@ 60 Munich must do without att@@ acking mid@@ fiel@@ der Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
An examination revealed that the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old has suffered an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had compl@@ ained of pain at the beginning of the week .
According to the Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis means &quot; probably a four week compulsory break &quot; .
&quot; It &apos;s hit us hard . R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; We have to think about it of course , &quot; Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club .
However the next training guest the sex@@ agen@@ arian is due to present is a def@@ ender .
Thir@@ ty-@@ year-old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg .
At the moment the Croatian has &quot; the opportunity to prove himself &quot; .
Following his conc@@ ussion , goal sc@@ orer Rub@@ in O@@ ko@@ tie is returning to training with the team in the coming week .
The Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday .
O@@ ko@@ tie sustained a head injury in a violent col@@ li@@ sion in the match with Fort@@ una D@@ ussel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
Con@@ tr@@ ary to initial fears , however , the wo@@ und was not serious .
Not a diet fruit – man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ goes are exotic , ju@@ ic@@ y and sweet .
But anybody watching their wa@@ ist@@ line should avoid them .
Because man@@ goes have a relatively high sugar content – primarily su@@ cro@@ se .
The exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy : they contain B vit@@ am@@ ins as well as vit@@ am@@ ins E and C. But most of all man@@ goes are full of vit@@ amin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or , bet@@ a-@@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
E@@ ating the fruit boo@@ sts the sight , immune system and the body &apos;s met@@ abo@@ lic processes .
When buying man@@ goes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant arom@@ a .
It is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ri@@ pe the fruit is – even green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
They should be kept at room temperature and consum@@ ed within a few days .
They are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes .
A man@@ go also gives a special touch even to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
They mitig@@ ate the slightly bitter taste of some lea@@ f sal@@ ads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and radic@@ chio .
And a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lam@@ b and game .
US par@@ cel service UPS is again taking on up to 9,@@ 500 temporary staff for its Christmas service in the USA .
The company has already started to recru@@ it seasonal workers , UPS reported on Tuesday .
We are lo@@ oo@@ king for drivers in particular .
In the past few years , UPS increased its workforce by 9,@@ 500 for the four day season .
In light of bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ E@@ x have for several years been making provisions earlier in order to be prepared for Christmas business .
In 2013 there was harsh criticism of late deliveries by the par@@ cel service .
First a fo@@ eh@@ n storm , then a pron@@ ounced cold front
The fo@@ eh@@ n will break through in the valleys on the nor@@ then side of the Alps in the coming night , Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z announced on Tuesday .
The fo@@ eh@@ n will blow through the Fo@@ eh@@ n Val@@ leys on Wednesday , continuing through the night , sometimes at g@@ ale force .
Once the fo@@ eh@@ n has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , gu@@ sty winds and a drop in temperature .
According to Met@@ e@@ o@@ News , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Is@@ les in a strong sou@@ th@@ western flow .
The fo@@ eh@@ n will break through the valleys on the northern sides of the Alps during Tuesday night .
The fo@@ eh@@ n will then blow through the Fo@@ eh@@ n Val@@ leys until Thursday morning with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h ; occasionally , and particularly in the c@@ anton of U@@ ri , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .
In places the fo@@ eh@@ n may advance into the adjacent mid@@ land , and on the mountains g@@ ale force winds of over 120 km / h are even possible .
While in the north stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ ns on Wednesday will bring sum@@ mer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , mo@@ ist@@ ure will begin to build up on the southern slopes of the Alps .
Here it will start to rain and this will continue until Thursday evening .
Over the next 48 hours the south of the Alps can expect over 100 li@@ tres of rain per square met@@ re in places , following on from a large volume of rain which has fallen over the last few days .
On Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n will die down , resulting in a cold front with heavy , sometimes th@@ under@@ y rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland .
In conjunction with the cold front , the wind will get stronger increasing to stor@@ my , and temperatures will decrease sharp@@ ly .
The following days will be aut@@ um@@ n@@ al in the north with temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sun@@ nier and war@@ mer at the weekend with temperatures up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square
Some 500 years after the Re@@ formation , Rome now has a Martin Lu@@ ther Square .
In the presence of the Mayor of the City , Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hi@@ therto un@@ named square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was on Wednesday best@@ owed with the name of the German re@@ former .
On the &quot; Piazza Martin L@@ ut@@ re@@ o &quot; he is now recognised as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Re@@ formation &quot; .
The park is in the centre of Rome right next to the C@@ olo@@ sse@@ um
The con@@ sortium of Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
J@@ ens@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the Evangel@@ ical Lu@@ ther@@ an community in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that for centuries Protest@@ ants in the P@@ ope &apos;s city often had to hide their faith .
The square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
As a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
At the time he considered the city to be a de@@ generate hot@@ bed of vice .
According to hist@@ ori@@ ans , his negative impres@@ sions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther her@@ al@@ ded the beginning of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the selling of indul@@ gen@@ ces .
Tal@@ ented artist inv@@ ests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the ( g@@ il@@ ded ) cro@@ wn of thor@@ ns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Al@@ t has painted for his Bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bi@@ ble .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Bi@@ ble , which has now been issued with magnificent pictures .
For Ot@@ mar Al@@ t , who has de@@ vised his own personal interpretation of bi@@ b@@ lical stories in 150 mo@@ ti@@ fs on paper and can@@ vas , in the beginning was the picture .
The 7@@ 5-@@ year-old conceived his &quot; language &quot; with bright colours and imagin@@ ative forms - which are however by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; f@@ unny &quot; pictures .
On the contrary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thoroughly glo@@ om@@ y .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t worked on his Bi@@ ble project for around three years and for this project he made a subj@@ ective choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the &quot; Book of books &quot; .
Cy@@ cles evol@@ ved , dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross , pl@@ ag@@ ues , the Comm@@ and@@ ments or the Lord &apos;s Pra@@ yer .
Without even approaching them , he immediately att@@ acted multiple partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther Verlag , a publish@@ er speci@@ alising in the@@ ological works as well as the K@@ ett@@ ler Verlag , who focus on publishing art books .
And in particular author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who has gra@@ p@@ pled with the particular Bi@@ ble pass@@ ages based on the paintings .
He has interpreted the Bi@@ ble texts selected by Ot@@ mar Al@@ t and &quot; translated &quot; them to the current day , in a topical context .
These texts are like verb@@ al mir@@ rors of Al@@ t &apos;s paintings .
They are embedded between the original Bi@@ ble quot@@ ations of Martin Lu@@ ther and each composition by the artist , who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations .
The decorated cover of the book is let@@ tered in gold .
The 7@@ 5-@@ year-old allows at the same time a tw@@ o@@ fold insight , deep into both his soul and his emotions .
This is particularly intimate .
Ultim@@ ately , his emotions were the key trigger for the Bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Al@@ t , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ ut order .
&quot; Education there took place under the shadow of the cane &quot; , rem@@ embers Ot@@ mar Al@@ t .
&quot; I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : &quot; The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
Sy@@ mbo@@ li@@ sm has been driven out .
Arti@@ sts have a different passion and joy in presenting things .
Pic@@ tures always have something mysteri@@ ous about them ; they are not decoration .
&quot; In this respect , I am a din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t wants his vie@@ wers to let themselves &quot; fall into &quot; the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : &quot; The picture is looking for its counter@@ part &quot; .
At the launch of the Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Bi@@ ble on Tuesday , Klaus Al@@ te@@ post conf@@ essed to having &quot; always &quot; been a lo@@ ver of Ot@@ mar Al@@ t &apos;s art : &quot; I like the way he sees life with his pictures &quot; .
Al@@ t was not interested in recording the whole of the Bi@@ ble , selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysteri@@ ous .
&quot; This wasn &apos;t a collaboration between partners , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post , &quot; it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . &quot; The result is a picture Bi@@ ble .
For Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of the Lu@@ ther Verlag this work is an invitation &quot; to add depth to his life and to find freedom &quot; .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t &apos;s pictures speak , for Mö@@ h@@ ler , the ( bi@@ b@@ lical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
Some of the origin@@ als - paper and can@@ vas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar Al@@ t Foundation .

Plans made , site found , company commissioned , mo@@ und for a circuit mod@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was closed again .
Political and administrative fail@@ ings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
So the mo@@ und was demo@@ lished and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
Appro@@ val will be received in October , chief local coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sab@@ ine Mos@@ eb@@ ach@@ -B@@ och has now been able to inform the children &apos;s and young people &apos;s committee .
&quot; I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , &quot; she said .
The work should then be started without any &quot; further pause for thought &quot; at the site of the former indoor swimming pool .
D@@ F@@ B steps up its commitment to refugees
The German football leag@@ ue gave clear indications at the weekend that the D@@ F@@ B is extending its commitment to refugees to 20@@ 19 .
Foot@@ ball has re@@ acted to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; Basi@@ cally nobody knows , it &apos;s no concern of mine , it &apos;s not my doing . &quot;
&quot; It is in the interests of everybody to get to gri@@ p with this issue , &quot; says D@@ F@@ B chief Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I &apos;m going to be in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and I &apos;m meeting there with State Minister Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure the topic will play a central role there , &quot; he announ@@ ces .
Foot@@ ball can and will help .
But the politicians must set the deciding guidelines .
The German Foot@@ ball Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; Through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us-@@ Brau@@ n foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 20@@ 19 , &quot; declared N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the U@@ EFA meeting in St Juli@@ an &apos;s , Malta
Several teams are also supporting the programme .
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words &quot; We are helping – # refuge@@ es@@ welcome &quot; on the left sle@@ eve of their strip instead of the usual spons@@ or &apos;s logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , &quot; L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sport bo@@ ss Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller told the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper on Tuesday , and describes the scheme as &quot; a matter of course &quot; .
&quot; The refugee drama concerns everyone , nobody can look away . &quot;
&quot; We football teams can , no , we must use our char@@ is@@ ma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , &quot; says Her@@ th@@ a manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a prominent signal by the leag@@ ue .
The women &apos;s national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle ( Sa@@ ale ) for the World Cup quali@@ fying match against Hungary .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach describes supporting the refugees as &quot; a grand joint effort by German football . &quot;
It is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
The message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; that we have sent out is being lived in football .
&quot; That is of enormous significance , &quot; he said .
In both this year and next year the association together with the D@@ F@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 300@@ ,000 available for the integration of refugees .
&quot; The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; reports N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
Re@@ ports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
According to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
In an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA after mid@@ night , he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ wo@@ che &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; He almost b@@ led to death , he was un@@ conscious , then he dra@@ g@@ ged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; quoted SAP co-@@ founder H@@ asso Plat@@ tner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t will however be able to return to work .
&quot; We are meeting up at the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf at the beginning of October , &quot; said Plat@@ tner .
The 5@@ 4-@@ year-old manager will be at the meeting and &quot; fully fit for work &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutschen Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday &apos;s edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
&quot; I am definitely there for SAP , completely involved in my job . &quot;
&quot; I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , H@@ asso Plat@@ tner , the whole time , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t told the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
I@@ i is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; It could happen to anyone &quot; .
&quot; The important thing is to get up again if you fall down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren reserve driver Magn@@ us@@ sen out of action …
Magn@@ us@@ sen twi@@ t@@ tered a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike .
This means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers , Fern@@ ando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as sli@@ m as those for the Grand Prix in Japan a week later .
Foot@@ ball : B@@ V@@ B v K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar without R@@ eus : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in goal
All hopes have been crus@@ hed for Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund that Marco R@@ eus might make a com@@ eb@@ ack in the first group match of the European leag@@ ue .
The international player will also be missing from the German Bundes@@ lig@@ a leader &apos;s match in its dual with F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sky ) .
&quot; Unfortunately he isn &apos;t in the running , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
The B@@ V@@ B coach is leaving it open as to whether R@@ eus will be there on Sunday in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a top match against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en : &quot; We are expecting him to return to training on Friday &quot; .
In light of the heavy burden on his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of R@@ eus &apos;s position .
So he has announced a change of go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper .
Thus Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of regular ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; He &apos;s training at absolute top level , &quot; pra@@ ised the world champion &apos;s football coach .
Tu@@ ch@@ el is leaving it open as to whether Wei@@ den@@ felder will be used in all European leag@@ ue matches in the future .
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game .
Mid@@ fiel@@ der Juli@@ an Wei@@ gl considers team m@@ ate R@@ eus &apos;s br@@ is@@ k statement that the final of the European leag@@ ue must be B@@ V@@ B &apos;s objective quite understandable : &quot; Marco isn &apos;t so far off the mark with that &quot; .
&quot; I think we &apos;ve got a good chance of pic@@ king up the title . &quot;
Rob@@ ot cars : Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Federal Government wants Germany to be technological leaders in changes to cars .
On Wednesday the German cab@@ inet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday , on the br@@ ink of the IA@@ A motor show , about a &quot; new era of mobility &quot; .
Autom@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic j@@ ams , said D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt .
He wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
The Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio .
There is currently a test area on the A@@ 9 motorway to try out the new technology .
In order that &quot; no extra liability risk will be imposed &quot; on drivers , the government wants to &quot; examine and , where necessary , adapt &quot; legal parameters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ ver@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
The German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienna Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
With automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
However dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles &quot; are not anticipated until 2020 &quot; on public roads .
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany will be around € 8.@@ 4 billion for 20@@ 25 .
&quot; Digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; says SP@@ D transport politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
However the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers &apos; personal data must be conclu@@ sively clarified .
And Germans still view dri@@ ver@@ less cars scep@@ tically – much more than the French or Americans .
A survey by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the testing organisation Dek@@ ra , presented to the IA@@ A on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
In France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonom@@ ously driven cars by 20@@ 25 and in the USA 33 percent .
Any@@ way drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
According to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
Nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on motor@@ ways in free-@@ f@@ lowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic j@@ ams .
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll not to play in team and doub@@ les in European Championship
As things stand , the D@@ ussel@@ dorf player plans to play only in the sing@@ les in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision will be made on 22 September .
&quot; It is a major loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; The l@@ ads heard about it this morning . &quot;
&quot; But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Tim@@ o , &quot; said national coach J@@ ör@@ g Ros@@ sk@@ opf during European Championship training in D@@ ussel@@ dorf .
At this time B@@ oll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with spons@@ ors in China .
The 3@@ 4-@@ year-old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; Without Tim@@ o we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favour@@ ites , &quot; declared individual European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ char@@ ov .
But the Ham@@ el@@ in player , who is the top seed in E@@ k@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rem@@ embers the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at in 2013 .
&quot; We didn &apos;t have Tim@@ o then either , and we still became European Champ@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; That is what we need to focus on , &quot; declared the world number five .
The English football national player Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
In the course of the tackle in the Champ@@ ions League game with PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the def@@ ender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and after a long b@@ out of treatment was replaced .
Initi@@ al diagnosis indicates that the 20-@@ year-old who used to play with Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ stei@@ ger has broken his ti@@ bia .
G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old to be an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works chamber of hor@@ rors : designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday .
The highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look alarm@@ ingly human thanks to video proj@@ ection .
They wear the French designer &apos;s spectacular cre@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onna &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and also put men in sk@@ ir@@ ts .
&quot; These days I can &apos;t say I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture any longer , because I have white hair . &quot;
“ It used to be ble@@ ached , nowadays it &apos;s real , ” says G@@ aul@@ tier .
For visitors to the exhibition , &quot; From the Si@@ de@@ walk to the Cat@@ walk &quot; , which can be seen in the Kuns@@ th@@ alle at the H@@ yp@@ o Culture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluc@@ tant attitude to a show about his own character .
Origin@@ ally he was against it because , &quot; For me an exhibition sound@@ ed a bit like death , &quot; he said .
When you die , you get put into a museum .
This remarkable collection has already been st@@ aged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
It &apos;s about a lot more than beautiful clothes , &quot; says the director of the Kuns@@ th@@ alle , Rog@@ er Di@@ eder@@ en .
It is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhi@@ bits provide an insight into the hard to over@@ look work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
The show is not constructed chron@@ ologically , but it is a brilli@@ antly ch@@ ore@@ ograph@@ ed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins &apos; hair .
According to cur@@ ator Th@@ ier@@ r@@ y-@@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the cre@@ ators car@@ ted 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before the start of Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest there was also a special treat in store : a Leder@@ ho@@ sen out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Mad@@ onna
He has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are cle@@ ver@@ er than men &quot; ) and in people who are a little different , says G@@ aul@@ tier .
Even G@@ aul@@ tier &apos;s old t@@ ed@@ dy is on show in the exhibition .
He represents the designer &apos;s first , t@@ entative steps at fashion .
As a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and he was bad at football ) , he dres@@ sed his t@@ ed@@ dy in br@@ as and dres@@ ses .
His parents did not allow him to play with d@@ olls .
Later he taught himself fashion design .
He st@@ ole fashion magazines and scrut@@ in@@ ised other designers &apos; cre@@ ations , G@@ aul@@ tier told us in Munich .
Of course , later I bought them .
He was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Dec@@ oration instead of cur@@ tains – P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace as a fashion ni@@ che
There used to be long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en making many metres
of em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and l@@ aces in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table clo@@ ths and cur@@ tains .
This is no longer the case today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of Mo@@ des@@ pit@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en .
Instead , fashion is once more important .
In the early days of P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home textile industry – and now it is being re@@ discovered as a ni@@ che .
Rein@@ hardt gave a few examples : l@@ ace in decoration , for accessories such as bags and for traditional cost@@ umes .
Gener@@ ally , so-called vin@@ tage fashion , based on style eras from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
Anyone in the textile industry in Germany who cannot serve a ni@@ che is no longer in the market .
We are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
Mo@@ des@@ pit@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien trade association .
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
Sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
There are now hardly any private speci@@ ality shops or wholes@@ al@@ ers .
Our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
Nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more che@@ ap@@ ly in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
Furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weak@@ ening slightly .
This is enough reason for new directions .
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness , as C@@ ord@@ el@@ ia Bauer of Sti@@ ck@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein explains . &quot; As of this year we have implemented a seal of quality which shows that our production is ec@@ ologically and socially compatible .
Rein@@ hardt added , &quot; This also applies to the materials we use &quot; .
Quali@@ fied designer U@@ te Schmi@@ dt te@@ aches in the fac@@ ul@@ ty for applied arts at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West Sax@@ ony University of Z@@ wick@@ au and speci@@ alis@@ es in em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y and l@@ ace .
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is a field of tension between the designers &apos; newest ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , &quot; says Schmi@@ dt .
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
A few years ago textile designer K@@ ati Re@@ uter re@@ vit@@ alised the historic snow@@ ball l@@ ace .
The machines em@@ bro@@ i@@ der small be@@ ads in selected places .
P@@ lau@@ en master gol@@ d@@ s@@ mi@@ th Bi@@ an@@ ca Hal@@ leb@@ ach@@ -K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this . &quot; In the past I had no use for traditional P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace &quot; .
Now she uses the snow@@ ball l@@ ace for her je@@ well@@ ery .
Using an elabor@@ ate process she em@@ bo@@ ss@@ es the pattern in silver .
&quot; Many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace – young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
She also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland – primarily to customers whose for@@ ef@@ ath@@ ers lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
So with my je@@ well@@ ery I see myself as a modern amb@@ ass@@ ador for P@@ lau@@ en l@@ ace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t interfere with leg@@ ends , but Disney is dar@@ ing to make a new film of the classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; anyway .
But according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not going to be a re@@ make but a sort of sequ@@ el , set 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ ann@@ y .
It is about the n@@ ann@@ y &apos;s experiences with the B@@ anks family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
Who is going to take the role of Mary P@@ opp@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is not yet certain .
But the director has been decided : R@@ ob Mar@@ shall , whose most recent film was &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; .
X@@ i ur@@ ges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping told a group t@@ asked with ste@@ ering reform on Tuesday .
&quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investment and expertise , and improve open@@ ing-up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Le@@ ading Group for De@@ ep@@ ening Overall Reform .
Pro@@ mot@@ ing opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of bor@@ der-@@ control policies , encouraging state-@@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absor@@ b private capital and over@@ hau@@ ling the resident registration system .
According to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off-@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ loc@@ ating resources , ensuring a law@@ -based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loo@@ sen controls on the powers it deleg@@ ates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
In a bid to open up state-@@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign@@ -@@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
In addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by optim@@ izing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
Guar@@ ant@@ eeing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors were also discussed at a meeting .
The meeting was also attended by Premier L@@ i Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang , and senior leaders Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ in .
The consumer organisation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . &quot; Ris@@ ks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregn@@ ant women and small children , &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
According to Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt , the limits for the neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mer@@ cury per ki@@ lo@@ gram of fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; .
Large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish however are today so heavily contam@@ inated with mer@@ cury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of cat@@ ches may not be sold .
Once the limit has been doub@@ led , however , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ eable .
In return for this relaxation the EU , according to F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.@@ 1 mg of mer@@ cury per ki@@ lo@@ gram .
But F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch describes this as a &quot; tri@@ ck &quot; , because smaller pre@@ y fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today .
The reduction for small fish therefore is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous diver@@ sion@@ ary tac@@ tic which helps only the economy , &quot; declar@@ es Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt .
Mer@@ cury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accum@@ ul@@ ates largely in the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that &quot; even low levels , particularly in un@@ born children , can lead to damage to the ner@@ vous system &quot; .
The German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a &quot; health risk to the general population &quot; is not anticipated .
Mer@@ cury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bund@@ est@@ ag member Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , discharge more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury per year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
The concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , for example in the El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; exten@@ sively exceeded on a long-term basis , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
In the past year , Europ@@ e-@@ wide al@@ er@@ ts on mer@@ cury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch is calling for consumers to protest against the EU plans under : www.@@ qu@@ ecksil@@ ber-@@ aktion@@ .@@ food@@ wat@@ ch@@ .de
